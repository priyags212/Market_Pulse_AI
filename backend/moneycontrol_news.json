        "full_content": "Most families don’t think about cyber insurance until something unpleasant happens. A bank alert pops up for a transaction you didn’t make. A relative clicks the wrong link. A card detail leaks online. By then, you’re not comparing policies — you’re trying to stop damage. Cyber insurance exists for exactly these moments, but many people misunderstand what it actually does. It doesn’t erase fraud. It doesn’t magically restore peace. What it does is help manage the mess, financially and procedurally.\n\nIn India, family cyber insurance usually focuses on after-the-fact support. If money is stolen through online banking, UPI, cards, or phishing scams, the policy may reimburse part of the loss after investigation. That’s the headline feature people notice. What’s less obvious — and sometimes more useful — is the assistance that comes with it. Insurers often provide help with filing complaints, coordinating with banks, and guiding you through cybercrime reporting. When you’re stressed and unsure who to call, that structure matters.\n\nSome policies also deal with identity misuse. If your PAN, Aadhaar or card details are used to open accounts or takeloans,the insurer may cover legal fees, paperwork costs, and professional help to clean things up. This process can drag on for months without guidance. The insurance doesn’t fix your identity overnight, but it softens the financial hit of fixing it yourself.\n\nFamilies often overlook another part of cyber cover — online harassment and abuse. Certain policies offer legal consultation or counselling support if a family member faces cyberbullying, impersonation, or social media misuse. This is especially relevant for teenagers and older parents, who may struggle to navigate digital conflict on their own. The payout here is usually limited, but access to help can be valuable.\n\nWhere people get disappointed is what cyber insurance doesn’t cover. If money is lost because someone shared an OTP, password, or ignored clear warnings, insurers usually deny claims. From their perspective, that’s negligence, not fraud. Similarly, losses linked to crypto scams, online betting, or unregulated investment platforms are commonly excluded. Many people assume “online loss” means all online loss. It doesn’t.\n\nTiming also matters more than expected. Most policies require incidents to be reported quickly — sometimes within a day or two. People who wait, hoping the issue resolves itself, often lose eligibility without realising it. Fear and confusion delay action, and delay kills claims.\n\nAnother quiet issue is limits. A policy might say ₹10 lakh cover, but the fine print splits this into smaller caps. Online fraud may be capped at a few lakhs per incident. Legal expenses may have their own ceiling. In family policies, all members usually share the same pool. One serious incident can exhaust cover for the year.\n\nCyber insurance makes sense for families that live digitally — frequent UPI use, online shopping, remote work, elderly members using smartphones, children active on the internet. It is not a replacement for caution. It’s what you fall back on when caution fails.\n\nThe biggest mistake is treating cyber insurance as a guarantee. It’s not. It’s closer to a backup plan — helpful, limited, and conditional. Used with realistic expectations, it can reduce damage. Used blindly, it creates false confidence.\n\nCyber risks aren’t going away. Neither is confusion when they strike. Insurance won’t stop the problem, but knowing exactly what it can — and cannot — do keeps disappointment from becoming the second shock.\n\nDoes cyber insurance pay if I shared my OTP or UPI PIN by mistake?\n\nIn most cases, no. If the transaction happened after you shared an OTP, PIN or password — even under pressure or deception — insurers usually treat it as authorised and deny the claim.\n\nWill cyber insurance clear loans taken fraudulently in my name?\n\nTypically, no. Most policies cover assistance costs such as legal support and credit record correction, not repayment of fraudulent loans, unless the policy explicitly states otherwise.\n\nHow quickly do I need to report a cyber incident?\n\nVery quickly. Most policies require reporting to the bank, the cybercrime portal and the insurer within a short window, often 24 to 72 hours. Delays can invalidate an otherwise valid claim."

The time taken thereafter to distribute vehicles globally, following resumption of production to normal levels, only by mid-November.\n\nVolumes also impacted by planned wind down of legacy Jaguar models ahead of new Jaguar launch, a deterioration of market conditions in China, and ongoing incremental US tariffs impacting JLR’s US exports, Tata Motors said in a release.\n\nDhiman Gupta, Chief Financial Officer, TMPVL said, “Overall, it was a challenging quarter as anticipated on account of carryover impact of cyber incident at JLR, while domestic business delivered robust revenue and margin improvement quarter on quarter. We expect performance to significantly improve in Q4 with recovery at JLR and continuing growth in domestic market share.”\n\nJLR remains resilient and well placed to address the economic, geopolitical and policy challenges the industry faces. Investment spend is expected to remain at £18bn over the five-year period from FY24. In light of the challenges faced, FY26 guidance is reaffirmed, with EBIT margin in the range of 0% to 2% and free cash outflow of 2.2 billion pounds to 2.5 billion pounds, the company stated.\n\nAt the standalone level too TMPVL reported a loss at Rs 233 crore as against Rs 1471 crore reported in the same quarter previous year. The revenues from operations grew by 25 percent to Rs 15,163 crore as against Rs 12,112 crore posted in the same quarter previous year. EBITDA margins were at 7 percent, down 80 bps YoY.\n\nPassenger vehicle and electric vehicle volumes during the reporting quarter were at 171,000 units, up 22 percent year on year driven by impact of reduction in GST rates and robust performance of products, the company added.\n\nShailesh Chandra, Managing Director & CEO, TMPVL said, “In Q3 FY26, we recorded our highest-ever quarterly wholesales at 171,000 units, while retail sales crossed the 200,000 mark for the first time, driven by strong demand tailwinds from GST 2.0 and a robust festive season.”\n\nThe December quarter saw major product launches from Tata Motors including the Sierra and the unveiling of the Harrier and Safari in petrol. Later it also launched the Punch in a new avatar.\n\n“Going forward, we expect to accelerate growth with a strong product pipeline, healthy inventory levels, and sustained demand across segments, while strengthening our margin trajectory,” Chandra added."

        "full_content": "Tata Power plans to export its solar cells and modules to the US and Europe in the coming fiscal 2026-27 leveraging the conclusion of Free Trade Agreement with Europe and the US announcement of lower tariffs on Indian goods, CEO and MD Praveer Sinha told Moneycontrol in an interview. The company also plans to start operations for its 4,000 MW coal-fired ultra-mega power plant (UMPP) in Mundra by next month amid concerns of rising power demand as the summer season approaches.\n\nFurther,Tata Power,which has been assessing small modular reactors for its entry into the nuclear segment, is in discussions with state governments of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Odisha for acquisition of land for nuclear projects. It is also under discussions with state-run Nuclear Power Corp of India and other foreign players for technology support and collaboration in the nuclear segment.\n\nCan you outline your solar cell and manufacturing business and how do you further plan to expand your capacity?\n\nWe have set up a 4.3 gigawatt solar cell and module manufacturing plant. This is in addition to the 250 megawatt we have in Bangalore. And we have been able to stabilize the operation of the plant. Over the last nine months, the performance has improved drastically. What we are seeing is that my plant operation has stabilized, cost reductions have happened, further optimization work is going on. And we will be able to produce nearly 950 to 980 megawatt per quarter, because every day we produce about 11 megawatt.\n\nWe will be able to supply this to our own utility scale projects, as well as rooftop projects. And you will continue to see very good performance going forward.\n\nHow do you think the recently announced India-US deal help the industry? Do you also plan to export your cells and modules?\n\nYes, absolutely. We have plans to export. And now since the tariffs have come down, we will be very competitive to supply to various markets, including the US and Europe. And we do have plans to export in the coming year.\n\nCurrently, we have not done that. We wanted to first stabilize the plant. Secondly, there are certain certifications that are required for export purposes. We have completed all those certifications. And now, we will get up to supply in FY27.\n\nSpeaking on the recently announced India-US trade deal, Sinha had earlier said that the deal will open many opportunities including working with US companies on technology in the renewable and nuclear space.\n\nYou have earlier announced plans for ingot and wafer manufacturing. What is the update on that and by when do you plan to commission these?\n\nWe have been looking at setting up an ingot and wafer plant and also looking at who are the other players who are proposing to set up and what will be the demand supply going forward. We have also looked at what sort of technology and equipment we need to bring. We are looking at a 10 gigawatt capacity of ingots and wafers each.\n\nAnd this is a little complex in terms of manufacturing. So what sort of technology partner we will have who will support us in setting up of the plant as also in stabilizing the operations of the plant. So, those are under discussion.\n\nAnd we expect in the next two months time, we will be in a position to finalize it.\n\nHow do you plan to expand your hydro power generation portfolio? What other projects are into consideration?\n\nRight now, 1 gigawatt is under implementation and it's in a very good shape in terms of the construction. We do expect that apart from this 1 gigawatt pumped hydro,  we will set up another 1.8 gigawatt which is a pumped hydro in Shirota, for which we are obtaining the various approvals and clearances. I think by the second quarter of the next financial year, we'll be able to do it. And in the later part of this year, we will start the construction activity.\n\nAnd that will take about 60 months. Similarly, we are working on hydro plants in Bhutan. The first one of 600 megawatt, the Khorlochhu project, work is already going on at a very fast pace and that will get commissioned in FY29.\n\nSimilarly, there is another project of 1125 megawatt. We are doing the pre-project activities. We will achieve financial closure by July or August. We have already got the first approval of financing from the World Bank and IFC. And we expect that later part of this year, the construction activity will start.\n\nApart from UP discoms, are you considering bidding for the privatisation of any other state discoms? How has been the performance of Odisha discoms?\n\nWe have done exceedingly well in the Odisha discoms. Based on our learning experience over there, we are looking at many more opportunities.\n\nUP is one of the states which wants to go for public-private partnership. Apart from that, the Government of India, through the group of ministers, has identified another nine states which require to go through a public-private partnership because of the huge financial losses that they have. Also, the government is planning to bring the Electricity Act amendment, which will allow parallel licensing.\n\nAll this is expected to happen in the next six to nine months. And in all of them, we will actively participate and we look forward to being the major player in power distribution. We already are the largest in the country in the private sector and with more than 50% market share.\n\nAnd we expect that in future also, we will have a similar market share.\n\nGoing forward, how much capacity addition do you target in your rooftop solar segment?\n\nWhat we are seeing is that there is a huge amount of interest in various parts of the country (for rooftop solar), not only in urban areas, but also in rural areas.\n\nAnd the government subsidy under PM Suryaghar and also some of the states who have offered certain subsidies is encouraging the local people to go for rooftop solar. And this is a very, very attractive business, which I think we have major market share in. And I do believe that this will continue for many more years.\n\nThis will further get enhanced in the coming years because our supply chain, channel partner, and our ability to go ahead and implement and execute such projects is very good. And I'm 100% confident that we will continue to be one of the biggest players in rooftop solar.\n\nThis year (FY26) we will install around 1.4 gigawatt rooftop solar capacity. Next year (FY27), we should be able to do at least 2 gigawatts.\n\nWhat is the update on PPAs (power purchase agreements) for your Mundra plant? When do you see the plant starting operations?\n\nWe have had discussions with the Gujarat government and there were a large number of points on which we were discussing. All those points have been agreed. There's only one point which is pending and we are in the process of finalising that also. Once that is finalized, we will start the plant.\n\nWe are also parallelly based on the points agreed, taking up with the other four procurer states (Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Haryana)  so that we are in a position to conclude everything within this month and start the project and the plant because as summer is approaching, it is very necessary that the demand will increase and this is one of the lowest cost power that is available from any of the imported coal-based plants as also in the merit order for most of the states.\n\nI'm actually looking to start Mundra’s operations next month. So, possibly before the end of the financial year, we will be in a position to operate.\n\nAre you in discussions with any foreign players for technology support for your foray in the nuclear segment?\n\nWe have been discussing both with the Nuclear Power Corporation of India and Department of Atomic Energy and also with some of the foreign players to give us the technology and support in the erection commissioning and supply of equipment and operations.\n\nThe objective is that we need to set up these plants much faster and also the financial viability of these plants have to be ensured. So, we are working very closely with many of the foreign companies and Indian companies.\n\nWe are also working very closely with the state governments to identify the land availability or water and also to ensure that we get necessary approvals and clearances.\n\nI think we will be in a position to give more details once we know what are the rules and regulations for setting up these plants, what are the statutory requirements, environmental requirements and also the sourcing of uranium fuel for this. Hopefully, again in the next six to nine months, we'll get better clarity on the same.\n\nWith India partnering with both the US and Russia in the energy and nuclear space, will you be looking to partner with companies from these two countries?\n\nWhat is important is that the technology and cost has to be very competitive so that our cost of power generation is acceptable in the market. Also, the long-term sourcing of fuel has to be tied up. So, I think we need to discuss in more detail with all these technology companies from these countries and then take a call which is good for our consumers.\n\nWhich states have you identified for your nuclear projects?\n\nWe are in discussion in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Odisha. So, in many of the states, we are in discussion.\n\nNothing has been finalized yet, but yes, this is a discussion that we are having because the land has to be suitable for a nuclear plant. It should not be in earthquake-prone areas. There should be no habitation and some of the other things about water availability and all.\n\nSo, yes, we are trying to work out with the state governments to see how quickly this can be decided.\n\nWhat is your investment target for FY27?\n\nWe are targeting between Rs 20,000 crore to Rs 25,000 crores per year because these are the ongoing projects that we have in our renewable business, in our transmission, distribution, and some of our ongoing operational upgrades that we carry out. So, we will continue to have a similar type of investment in the coming year too."

        "full_content": "Most people delay consolidating bank accounts for one reason: fear. Auto-debits, SIPs, subscriptions, EMIs, insurance premiums — everything feels wired into different accounts, and the risk of something failing feels bigger than the benefit of simplification. The result is quiet clutter. Money scattered across accounts, half-remembered mandates, and a constant low-level anxiety about whether something will bounce.\n\nConsolidation doesn’t have to be disruptive. The mistake people make is trying to close accounts first and fix automation later. The correct approach is the opposite.\n\nBefore touching balances, make a list of every automated transaction linked to each account. This includes EMIs, SIPs, credit card auto-pay, OTT subscriptions, insurance premiums, school fees, utility bills and any standing instructions you may have forgotten about.\n\nMost banks show mandates inside netbanking, but not all recurring debits appear there. Check email histories and SMS alerts from the last three to six months. This step feels boring, but it’s the one that prevents surprises later. Consolidation without mapping is where most things break.\n\nChoose one primary account, not a “better” one\n\nDon’t start by asking which bank is best. Start by choosing one account to act as the central hub — the account where salary or main income will land and from which most payments will flow. Stability matters more than interest rate here. Pick an account you are unlikely to close for years.\n\nThis account becomes the anchor. Everything else gradually moves around it.\n\nRedirect inflows first, not outflows\n\nThe safest consolidation order is: income first, bills later. Redirect salary, freelance payments or regular credits to the primary account before changing any debits. Let inflows stabilise for at least one full cycle.\n\nOnce income is flowing consistently, you have buffer. Even if a debit fails during transition, you’re less likely to miss it completely.\n\nMove auto-debits in layers, not all at once\n\nShift automation in batches. Start with low-risk items like OTT subscriptions and utility bills. Wait a month and confirm they’re debiting correctly. Then move medium-risk items like SIPs and credit card payments. High-risk items — EMIs, insurance premiums, school fees — should be moved last.\n\nThis staged approach gives you checkpoints. If something goes wrong, you know exactly which change caused it.\n\nKeep old accounts alive temporarily — with minimal balance\n\nDo not close accounts immediately after moving mandates. Keep them open for at least two to three months with a small buffer balance. This catches any forgotten or delayed debit without penalties.\n\nMost automation failures don’t happen immediately. They happen one or two cycles later when an annual charge or infrequent bill hits. A temporary buffer is cheap insurance.\n\nUpdate one ecosystem at a time\n\nMany failures happen because people change everything together — bank account, mobile number, email ID, UPI apps. Avoid that. If you’re consolidating banks, keep contact details unchanged until the dust settles. Systems rely on overlapping identifiers, and changing too many at once creates confusion.\n\nOnce consolidation is complete, write down where everything now debits from. Not mentally — physically or digitally. This document becomes invaluable six months later when something feels off and you can’t remember why.\n\nClose accounts only after silence\n\nAn account is safe to close only after two or three months of zero unexpected activity. No surprise debits. No dormant charges. No forgotten mandates. Closing too early is the most common — and most avoidable — mistake.\n\nConsolidation should reduce thinking, not increase it\n\nThe goal isn’t just fewer accounts. It’s fewer checks, fewer transfers, fewer “did this go through?” moments. Done slowly and deliberately, consolidation brings clarity without disruption.\n\nAutomation doesn’t break because consolidation is risky. It breaks because consolidation is rushed.\n\n1. Will moving auto-debits affect my credit score if something fails during transition?\n\nA single missed debit does not automatically hurt your credit score, but missed EMIs or credit card payments can if they are not corrected quickly. That is why high-risk mandates should be moved last and old accounts kept open with a buffer until you are certain everything has migrated.\n\n2. How long should I keep old accounts open after moving mandates?\n\nIdeally two to three billing cycles. Some debits are quarterly, annual, or irregular, and closing an account too early is the most common cause of unexpected failures.\n\n3. Should I cancel old mandates manually or let them lapse when the account is closed?\n\nWhere possible, cancel mandates explicitly through the bank or service provider. Relying on account closure alone can create confusion if a provider retries a debit or flags your account for non-payment later."

        "full_content": "All it took was the launch of a new artificial intelligence (AI) tool by US-based Anthropic to trigger a massive rout in Nasdaq on Wednesday that saw a humungous $300 billion sell-off. Are market jitters contagious? Well, Wednesday’s Nasdaq rout led to weakness in global markets, too.\n\nThe new tool has stoked fears of disruption across existing software services and also across other industries. But AI biggies too lost ground as competition is seen to rise and raise existential issues for companies in a rapidly changing world of technology. Such questions caused a $830 billion erosion in market value of US software stocks in the last week. As industry veterans put it, while AI is the driving force in IT innovation, spends and future income, the days of all and sundry benefiting is behind.\n\nBut this kind of market rout is not new to investors. The present surge and rout in indices mirror the extreme valuations during the dot-com boom that finally ended in a prolonged bust, with Nasdaq seeing no respite and recovery for about three years.\n\nTake the Indian equity markets which have been volatile but range-bound for nearly a year. The Nifty 50 trades at 21 times one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple (PE) that is a tad higher than the long-term average of 19 times. Is this a fair valuation? The truth is that no one is sure what fair valuations are in a rapidly changing, new-age economy.\n\nComplicating the valuation game are the changing company narratives. AI was purported to lead to higher automation, efficiency and better service and integrate IT services in its work flow. This raised hopes of earnings ramp-up and valuations. But in less than a year, the market is pricing in a threat to margins and order flows of legacy platforms triggering a valuation conundrum for investors and a market crash!\n\nOn this topic, today’s FT article,Not just a tech sell-off,brings interesting insights for investors. It highlights a reversal in factors that drive returns in the stock markets. “Stocks with high dividend yields, low valuations and high return on equity did well,” it said, adding “while momentum, high volatility and growth all got smacked down”.\n\nSo, is growth and momentum investing being pushed aside and replaced by search for value stocks? Again, one can draw a parallel with the dotcom crash when growth which was crushing value until the latter half of 1999 started to stutter in 2000, after which markets tanked. Not very different is the change in valuations of Indian auto stocks, especially two-wheelers. The threat from new-age electric vehicle firms funded by private equity capital at sky high valuations took the charm off the old world stocks in the segment. But this was short-lived. Thelegacy playersmastered the game sooner than later, reinstating value in those stocks.\n\nSo, as long as there are such high levels of uncertainty, investors would be better-off bracing for volatility and sharp corrections in the market.\n\nInvesting insights from our research teamTata Power: Will Mundra resolution unlock the next leg of rerating?Solar Industries: Defence, global expansion power growthCanara Robeco AMC’s valuation comfort outweighs lacklustre quarterly showTrent: Will Q3 FY26 numbers drive re-rating?What else are we reading?Chart of the Day | Legacy automakers’ market share in electric two-wheelers surgesWhy investors must keep an eye on Bajaj Finance’s asset quality, post Q3KEC International: Robust order flows, but weak execution weighs down marginsFor UPL, gains from US trade deal can go beyond near-term sales recoveryIt’s not just a tech sell-off(republished from the FT)Where is AI showing up in the productivity data?(republished from the FT)Markets likely to hit new highs in 2026 after a well-balanced budget focused on capex and sustaining GDP growthMarkets may debate it, but Budget 2026 chose realism for a quiet reset in policy prioritiesMamata Banerjee, the first sitting CM to argue a case in SC, seizes the initiative from BJPWhy India’s defence–GDP ratio matters less than capabilityCan India’s carbon market shield exporters from Europe’s climate tax?As START ends, nuclear risks and proliferation will riseUnion Budget 2026 charts a path for emergent BharatPakistan PM’s T20 World Cup India boycott and the hypocrisy of preaching 'no politics in sport'MarketsMotilal Oswal Wealth backs large caps for 2026, sees opportunities in defence, power and digital infrastructureTech and StartupsDrone startups expect export tailwinds from India-US trade dealTechnical Picks:NHPC, TCSWe have a crack team of reporters writing on everything startups and tech.

        "full_content": "Information technology stocks have taken a knock following the launch of Anthropic’s tools, which have worsened concerns around AI-driven disruption in the industry.\n\nThe losses in IT stocks have singed technology-focused mutual funds, highlighting how sectoral funds tend to swing sharply during market volatility.\n\nOn February 4, the Nifty IT index recorded its biggest one-day fall since March 2020. As the IT sector extended losses, the index slipped another 1 percent on February 5, taking its two-day decline to around 7 percent.\n\nFor mutual fund investors, these short-term swings are part of sector investing and typically reflect market sentiment rather than a fundamental shift overnight.\n\nHow thematic tech funds were impacted\n\nThe end-of-day data for February 4 showed that sectoral and thematic technology equity funds delivered an average one-day return of -4.71 percent. While this decline was smaller than the fall in IT stocks, it still marked underperformance within the broader mutual fund universe for the day.\n\nIndustry experts say the reason is structural, as most tech-focused schemes typically hold concentrated portfolios dominated by four to six large IT companies. As a result, sharp sector-wide corrections tend to translate quickly into NAV declines, unlike diversified equity funds that spread exposure across multiple sectors.\n\nNAV changes differed across individual funds, but most tech funds fell in line with the broader IT sector decline.\n\nTech funds vs diversified equity funds\n\nThe contrast was visible when compared with diversified equity categories. On the same day, flexi-cap funds posted an average one-day return of 0.39 percent, supported by exposure to sectors that either remained stable or moved higher during the session. Over one year, flexi-cap funds delivered an average return of 6.84 percent, highlighting how diversified portfolios tend to cushion sector-specific shocks. Similarly, the Nifty 50 was down by 0.2 percent on February 4.\n\nThe figures show that sectoral funds rise faster in rallies and fall harder when a sector turns weak.\n\nWhat does it mean for investors?\n\nAccording to Gaurav Arora, Head of Research at SAHI, “Investor response should depend largely on how much technology exposure already exists in the portfolio.” Investors with limited exposure of 5-10 percent should avoid knee-jerk reactions. At this level, IT acts as a sectoral allocation rather than a portfolio driver, and short-term volatility does not materially impair long-term outcomes,” Arora said.\n\nA higher exposure changes the equation. “When tech accounts for 25-30 percent or more of equity allocation, concentration risk becomes real. In such cases, gradual rebalancing helps manage downside risk without exiting the sector entirely,” he said.\n\nFor SIP investors, the current fall is not a reason to abandon discipline but it does warrant a review, experts say. If tech funds form a small part of monthly SIPs, continuing unchanged can help long-term cost averaging. Where thematic tech funds dominate SIP allocations, redirecting incremental flows towards diversified equity funds may offer a better balance.\n\nLump-sum investors are advised to be cautious. This phase is not a straightforward buy-the-dip opportunity. Staggered investments, combined with close monitoring of earnings visibility and business adaptation to AI, are seen as more prudent than aggressive averaging.\n\n“AI is not replacing Indian IT’s role. In many ways, it is shifting companies from cost arbitrage to intelligence arbitrage, where integration, data and execution matter,” Swati Jain, CEO-Wealth at Arihant Capital Markets, said.\n\n“Investors with smaller allocations can treat the correction as part of a sectoral cycle, while concentrated portfolios still warrant diversification.”\n\nWhile tech funds can enhance returns during favourable cycles, they also carry sharper downside risks. For investors, maintaining portfolio balance matters more than reacting to a single day’s market move, say experts.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Revenue from international patients rose 14 percent to Rs.230 crore, making up about 9 percent of total hospital revenue.\n\nOperating EBITDA rose 4 percent to Rs.648 crore. Operating margin slipped to 26.1 percent, down from 27.3 percent a year earlier, the company attributed the margin compression to several factors including discontinuation of high‑value patented chemotherapy drugs for institutional patients after restrictive pricing guidelines from CGHS, pre‑commissioning expenses as new brownfield capacity came online in Mohali, Nanavati Max and Max Smart and GST rate change.\n\nA temporary disruption in cashless services for standalone health insurer patients, which caused substitution with lower‑tariff PSU patients until cashless services were restored late in the quarter.\n\nThe ARPOB (average revenue per occupied bed) rose to Rs.77,900 from Rs.75,900 a year earlier, while EBITDA per bed declined to Rs.71.3 lakh from Rs.73 lakh because of the cost overhang. Occupancy stood at 74 percent.\n\nMax Healthcare continued to push ahead with its expansion pipeline. 53 beds were commissioned at MSSH Mohali, delivering an EBITDA margin of 39 percent; 63 beds were added at Nanavati Max with a 31 percent margin; and a 400‑bed tower at Max Smart is expected to go live by February. The Board also approved a 260‑bed expansion at MSSH Dwarka, taking that facility to 560 beds. In addition, the company acquired Yerawada Properties Pvt. Ltd. to develop a 450‑bed greenfield hospital in Pune, targeted for commissioning in 2030.\n\nFree cash from operations stood at Rs.281 crore, slightly lower than Rs.303 crore last year, as Max deployed Rs.408 crore into expansion and modernisation projects. Net debt rose to Rs.2,166 crore from Rs.2,067 crore in the previous quarter.\n\nChairman and MD Abhay Soi said new beds were already delivering accretive margins and would drive further ramp‑up.\n\n“Revenue and PAT grew 10 percent and 9 percent, respectively… Our new brownfield beds have demonstrated accretive margins. We expect significant ramp‑up in Q4 and in FY27,” he said."

Sure, your bank accounts, investments, property and insurance all get neatly listed and legally assigned, but what rarely makes it into this planning is something far more practical: passwords.\n\nYour passwords are the gateway to your money, records and even memories. Bank statements are online-only, investments are app-based, tax filings sit in email inboxes, and insurance policies arrive as PDFs. If the person who managed all of this suddenly dies, the family may technically inherit everything and still be locked out of it.\n\nThis is where traditional estate planning quietly breaks down.\n\nA will names beneficiaries, not logins\n\nA will tells the law who gets what. It does not tell your spouse how to log into your email to find policy documents, or your child how to access your investment account to even identify what exists. Financial institutions are cautious, slow and often bound by strict privacy rules. Even close family members can be denied access for months while paperwork moves.\n\nDuring that time, bills,loanEMIs etc. still need to be paid, and deadlines do not pause for grief. Families often end up scrambling, guessing passwords, calling helplines, or worse, discovering too late that an account even existed.\n\nWhat responsible digital planning actually looks like\n\nGood planning does not mean writing passwords in a notebook or texting them to someone. It means creating a system that allows access when needed, without compromising security while you are alive.\n\nThis usually involves a trusted digital vault or password manager, a clear list of critical accounts, and instructions on who can access what. Some people also include a digital executor role, someone specifically tasked with managing online accounts.\n\nThe goal is not control. It is continuity.\n\nAccess is also emotional. Families often lose photos, videos, messages and personal records because they are stored in locked devices or cloud accounts. These things may not have financial value, but they matter deeply after loss.\n\nDigital planning is as much about preserving memories as it is about managing money.\n\nA perfectly drafted will cannot log into your email, unlock your phone or reset a two-factor authentication app. If your passwords die with you, your family inherits confusion instead of clarity.\n\nEstate planning today is incomplete unless it includes a digital plan.\n\nIs it legal to share passwords with family members?\n\nSharing passwords informally can violate the terms of some services, but planning for access through a digital legacy or password management system is generally allowed. Many platforms now offer legacy access options that activate after death.\n\nCan I just write my passwords into my will?\n\nThis is not a good idea. Wills can become public documents during probate, and leaving your passwords in it can become a security risk. Passwords should be stored securely and referenced indirectly, not written out in legal paperwork.\n\nWhat is the simplest first step to fix this?\n\nStart by listing all major digital accounts and choosing one secure place to store access details. Then make sure at least one trusted person knows where that information is kept and how to access it if something happens to you."

Competition for talent is also picking up as global firms hire in India, pushing up salaries and attrition rates.\n\nKotak’s push pits it against other lenders in the region known for their technology prowess, including Singapore’s DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and Australia’s Macquarie Group Ltd.\n\nWhen a regulatory technology embargo imposed in 2024 due to shortcomings at Kotak was lifted last year, it paved the way for an acceleration of its tech drive, Lathia said.\n\nThe bank used the pause to rework its core banking systems and bring large portions of software development in-house, reducing reliance on external vendors and giving engineers tighter control over mission-critical infrastructure.\n\nSince then, Kotak has gone more than a year without a single unplanned outage in its core banking system, while handling a 60% to 70% year-on-year increase in transaction volumes. Transaction latency — the time taken for a transaction to be processed and completed — on Kotak’s consumer-facing digital app has dropped to under 500 milliseconds, from a few seconds previously, he added.\n\nNearly 1,800 of Kotak’s engineers come from the technology and global financial firms Lathia targets, and the bank plans to hire an additional 300 to 500 engineers in the next financial year that begins April 1, he said. Lathia took over last year from his predecessor Milind Nagnur, who had also pushed a similarly-focused recruitment drive.\n\nMeantime, Kotak is opening fewer physical branches than some peers while steadily increasing tech investment. Tech spending now accounts for about 13% of operating expenses, up from roughly 10% a couple of years ago, and continues to rise, Lathia said. The bank’s goal is to use automation and scale to keep costs stable even as business volumes grow, creating room to reinvest in platforms and products.\n\nArtificial intelligence is becoming central to that effort. Kotak already uses machine learning and AI to monitor transactions, flag anomalous behavior and strengthen cybersecurity.\n\n“In about eight months, almost everything we do will be AI-infused,” Lathia said, adding that hundreds of engineers are already using AI agents to generate code and nearly 35,000 employees use AI tools in their daily work."

        "full_content": "Officials in India are publicly debating age restrictions for accessing social media, a potential fresh challenge to Big Tech in a massive market for users as global debate grows over online harms to children.\n\nParliamentarian Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu, whose party is aligned with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s, plans to introduce a private member’s bill in the coming months barring children under 16 from maintaining social media accounts. The aim is to ensure data privacy and protect children and adolescents from exploitation, Devarayalu said in an interview.\n\nSuch bills don’t represent government policy and typically don’t become laws, but can lead to wider parliamentary debate. State level officials and India’s finance ministry have also raised the issue of potential harms from social media.\n\nAny move to limit access to platforms in the world’s most populous nation would be a blow to the likes of Meta Platforms Inc.’s Instagram and Facebook, Snap Inc.’s Snapchat, Elon Musk’s X and more. Australia blocking under-16s from social media has prompted governments around the world to propose following suit, and a similar move by India would be the most significant yet by the number of users affected.\n\nInstagram and Facebook each have over 400 million users in India, more than any other country, according to DataReportal, a library of reports on global digital behavior. Snapchat has more than 200 million on its platform there, making India its largest market by users, while X has more than 20 million users, the data shows.\n\nWhile the companies typically earn less revenue per user in India than in more economically developed countries such as the US, India represents unrivaled potential for growth. It is home to the world’s largest remaining pool of untapped digital consumers, with legions of people yet to get online.\n\nDevarayalu said responsibility for ensuring compliance would rest with the tech firms. Penalties according to his planned Social Media Age Restrictions and Online Safety Bill could be as much as 2.5 billion rupees ($28 million) or 5% of a company’s global revenue, whichever is lower.\n\n“If we can ban apps like TikTok, or the ones for gambling, this can be done easily as well because the resources are there for it,” he said.\n\nIndia in 2020 blocked TikTok and other Chinese apps on national security grounds and last year put in place a law banning online gambling.\n\nMeta, Snap and X, along with India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nDevarayalu, 42, entered parliament in 2019 and is the vice chairman of a group of educational institutions in Andhra Pradesh. The southern state is studying Australia’s ban on children using social media, its minister in charge of technology and human resources said last month.\n\nMeanwhile, the IT minister for populous Maharashtra state, home to the financial capital of Mumbai, has ordered a task force be assembled to recommend methods for addressing the harms of social media to children. In a Monday post on X, he cited the “alarming rise in digital addiction among children and its adverse impact on their mental and physical well-being.”\n\nThe minister, Ashish Shelar, said in an interview on Wednesday that a minimum age hadn’t been specified.\n\nLast week, India’s Economic Survey raised age-based restrictions on social media use as an issue for discussion. The annual survey is released by India’s Ministry of Finance and represents an annual report card on the economy and lays out the outlook for the country.\n\nAustralia in December became the world’s first democracy to initiate such a social media crackdown with its under-16 ban. Several countries have since made similar moves or signaled they’re considering action.\n\nSpain’s prime minister on Tuesday said the country would limit social media use for those under 16, and at least six other countries, including France, the UK, and the Netherlands, are weighing similar restrictions."

Similarly, Delhi-NCR, which witnessed an exceptional 49 percent price surge last year, saw growth ease to 6 percent in 2025, the report said.\n\nHowever, only Bengaluru and Hyderabad bucked the trend and recorded relatively stronger price appreciation. Bengaluru led the chart with 13 percent average price growth in 2025, marginally higher than the 12 percent rise recorded in 2024. Hyderabad registered 8 percent growth, a notable improvement over the 3 percent increase seen last year.\n\nKolkata recorded a 6 percent increase in average housing prices, down from 10 percent in 2024, while prices in Chennai remained flat, after rising 16 percent in the previous year, the report said.\n\nMarket observers attributed the slowdown to a combination of base effect, affordability concerns, and a more cautious buyer sentiment following steep price hikes in 2024. While demand from end-users continues to support the market, the pace of price appreciation is expected to remain measured in the near term, with city-specific factors playing a larger role in shaping housing trends.\n\nOnkar Shetye, executive director of Aurum PropTech, the company that owns PropTiger.com, said that MMR price trends through 2025 reflects price consolidation in the region's premium market while that of Pune and Ahmedabad remaining broadly stable. Delhi NCR and Kolkata also saw measured price increases amid selective demand. Bengaluru and Hyderabad showed steady end-user demand and balanced absorption.\n\n“Overall, resilient pricing alongside moderating sales volumes highlights a disciplined, supply-calibrated market, where developers protected price integrity and inventory remained well managed-creating a stable pricing base heading into 2026,” he said.\n\nAccording to the report, unsold inventory growth was more visible in higher ticket-size categories, reflecting longer decision cycles and lower liquidity compared to mass and mid-income housing.\n\nHousing sales decline by 12 percent\n\nAccording to the report, residential sales declined 12 percent across the country at 3,86,365 units in 2025, down from 4,36,992 units in 2024. This is the lowest annual sales since 2022.\n\nIn Q4 2025, sales contracted 10 percent YoY and 0.5 percent QoQ to 95,049 units. This is the lowest quarterly sales since Q2 2023 (80,250 units).\n\nThe total new supply fell 6 percent to 3,61,096 units in 2025 as against 3,85,221 units in 2024. This is the lowest annual supply since 2021. In the October-December (Q4) 2025 quarter, supply rose 4 percent YoY and 0.2 percent QoQ to 92,007 units."

It is designed for an annual capacity of 250,000 vehicles.\n\nThe move seeks to centralize JLR’s Indian operations in a modern hub closer to major ports and suppliers, the people said. While initial output for the Evoque is expected to be under 10,000 units for the local market, Tata plans to eventually leverage the site for exports, they added.\n\nA representative for Tata Motors declined to comment on the opening date of the new plant.\n\nThe localized push comes as JLR navigates mounting headwinds in its traditional strongholds. In China, once a primary profit driver, sales are pressured by higher consumption taxes and fierce competition from domestic EV rivals. Simultaneously, the marquee is grappling with elevated US import tariffs and the financial fallout of a 2025 cyberattack that disrupted global production.\n\nIndia remains a rare bright spot for high-end SUVs. Tata, which acquired JLR from Ford Motor Co. in 2008, began local assembly in 2011 to bypass steep import duties. By expanding its domestic manufacturing footprint, JLR aims to price competitively against German competitors Mercedes-Benz Group AG, BMW AG and Volkswagen AG’s Audi.\n\nOver the years, Tata’s local assembly of JLR portfolio has expanded to include the Evoque, Range Rover Velar, Discovery Sport and Jaguar F-Pace. In late 2024, the company added the larger and higher-priced Range Rover and Range Rover Sport to the lineup, a sign of confidence in India’s appetite for high-end vehicles and manufacturing capability.\n\nTata Motors currently produces passenger vehicles at its Pune facility in Maharashtra and Sanand plant in Gujarat, with a combined annual capacity of about 900,000 units a year, which is scalable to over 1 million units.\n\nShares of the company slipped nearly 3% in Mumbai during trading on Thursday. It’s reporting quarterly earnings later in the day."

The startup has raised more than what it was in talks for, underlining rising investor conviction in category-focused quick commerce models beyond groceries and food delivery.\n\nThe company will use the fresh capital to scale operations, invest in technology, step up brand building, expand to new markets and build a more elevated customer experience, Zilo said. Over the next 12–14 months, it plans to deepen its capabilities, strengthen its presence in Mumbai and expand to a few additional cities.\n\nFounded by former Flipkart and Myntra executives Padmakumar Pal and Bhavik Jhaveri, Zilo operates a fashion quick commerce platform that delivers styles from over 200 brands in under 60 minutes, with features such as home trials and instant returns.\n\nThe company is building a vertically integrated model focused on speed, assortment and tighter control over customer experience.\n\nThe fundraise comes soon after Zilo partnered with celebrity stylist and fashion editor Anaita Shroff Adajania as style director and equity partner, a move aimed at strengthening fashion curation and discovery on the platform as the fashion quick commerce playbook continues to evolve.\n\n“This round is a strong validation of our belief that fashion and speed don’t have to be trade-offs... The capital will help us scale thoughtfully, deepen our tech and deliver a truly elevated fashion experience at quick-commerce speed,” Pal, who is also the CEO, said.\n\nCIO Jhaveri said the capital will help accelerate geographic expansion, deepen platform and technology investments and build a vertically integrated, fashion-first supply chain. “We’re putting fashion shopping back in the right order — replacing endless scrolls with adequately relevant choices, expert-styled looks, the convenience of Home Trials, and the reliability of super-fast delivery,\" Jhaveri said.\n\nThis funding comes at a time when vertical quick commerce fashion startups and services are gaining traction , driven by Gen Z demand for speed and immediacy in apparel purchases.\n\nStartups such as Slikk, NEWME, Blip and Knot — alongside major platforms such as Myntra’s M-Now and Ajio’s Rush — have been racing to offer sub-90-minute or 30-minute delivery, reshaping how urban consumers shop for clothes and accessories.\n\nKriti Gupta, vice president at Peak XV Partners, said Zilo has the potential to transform the customer experience and build a category-defining platform.\n\nThe funding round is \"an early validation of our vertical quick commerce thesis and the belief that premium fashion shopping experience is still broken and offline\", Anoop Menon, consumertech lead at Chiratae Ventures, said. The founder’s experience helped Zilo leapfrog in early traction to take on larger established players in Mumbai, he said.\n\nKitty Agarwal, partner at InfoEdge Ventures, said they have strong conviction in the company's ability to build a scaled, differentiated business with best-in-class unit economics."

        "full_content": "Saregama, the oldest music label and an entertainment Intellectual Property (IP) company, is sharpening its focus on live events at a time when there is increasing policy focus on concerts and the broader Orange Economy.\n\n\"A long-term belief in the potential of live events in India keeps getting reinforced quarter after quarter and we will continue to put our focus and investments in this area,\" said Vikram Mehra, Managing Director (MD), Saregama.\n\nThe company's profit in Q3FY26fell to Rs 51.24 crore from Rs 62.34 crore during the same period a year ago. Total income was also down to Rs 267.8 crore from Rs 499.14 crore.\n\n\"There are many more shows planned in Q4, including our first music festival in Bengaluru in March ... shows around Lord Krishna, with Manoj Muntashir in Mumbai. We have got into bhajan clubbing shows big time,\" Mehra said during the Q3 FY26 earnings call on February 3.\n\nThe company's events business scaled up with successful music tours by Diljit Dosanjh and Himesh Reshammiya, alongside growing traction in the comedy vertical, featuring Viraj Ghelani, Aanchal Agrawal and Manhar Seth.\n\n\"We are still at a very early stage of the event economy in the country. Around two years back, when we started the events business, we had said that we will take a call after one year whether we want to continue in this business or not. And then Diljit (Dosanjh) happened. And after that Himesh (Reshammiya) happened. We are realising that there's a large enough potential,\" he said.\n\nTwo of Dosanjh's music tours have led to significant gains for the company's live events business. The Dil Luminati became the biggest live musical concert of 2024, and, last year, Dosanjh's Aura Tour also hit the right chords among audiences.\n\nSaregama's live events revenues hit a peak of Rs 278.9 crore in Q3 FY25. It dropped to Rs 22.2 crore in the last quarter but Mehra noted that it was the Dosanjh effect in the same quarter last year.\n\n\"We are grateful that we get a chance to work with two of those artists. The numbers will grow in a steady fashion but this kind of a lumpy revenue that you saw in Q3 of last year, which was not seen before, is one-off. Please don't hold it against us. It may or may not happen but the events vertical will keep on growing,\" he said.\n\nHe also said there is minimum capital requirement for the events business. \"The great part about the events vertical is there is very little capital which remains locked in it. At the end of this quarter, we have close to Rs 15 crore locked into the events vertical. The nature of the business is that you put the money in and the capital gets rotated within 30-40 days.\"\n\nMehra added that for their events vertical, the focus will be to be capital-light, and not get into infrastructure-related part of the events business and produce great shows with artists.\n\n\"Our attempt is going to be a high single- digit margin percentage. But it will take 2-3 years to  achieve these percentages on a steady basis. Today, it's a hit-and- miss. Some of the events end up delivering this. Some of the events which are at an early stage or wherever we are building a brand new IP ends up contributing negatively to the margin,\" Mehra said.\n\nThe events business revenue in FY25 touched Rs 285.2 crore, up from Rs 13.4 crore in FY24.\n\nCurrently, events business contributes 2 percent to Saregama's overall revenues.\n\nMehra also added that with the events business they are chasing profitability. \"We are happy doing 200 smaller events but there we have a higher assurance of profitability than doing these large events where the risk factors are pretty high.\"\n\nSaregama's live events push comes at a time when there is an increased focus on concerts, gaming and more. Even the Economic Survey of 2026 mentioned the Orange Economy and how music concerts aid the economy.\n\nThe Survey cited examples of countries like the US where live music generated over $130 billion and supported more than 900,000 jobs in 2019 and the UK where music tourism alone contributed $8.1 billion in 2022 or about 0.3 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), reflecting strong spillovers to hospitality, transport and retail.\n\nIt added that, in India, the concert economy is nascent but scaling, supported by a young population, rising incomes, digital ticketing platforms and improving urban infrastructure. \"With appropriate facilitation and integration into tourism and city branding strategies, the concert economy can become a meaningful driver of growth for Media and Entertainment (M&E), tourism and allied services,\" the Survey added."

        "full_content": "The moment you realise your phone is lost or stolen, assume it is in the wrong hands. Even if your screen is locked, a phone today is a gateway to UPI apps, bank alerts, email, cloud backups, Aadhaar-linked services and OTPs. Waiting to “see if it turns up” is the biggest mistake people make.\n\nStep one: Block your SIM card immediately\n\nCall your mobile operator or log in through another device and suspend the SIM. This cuts off OTPs, UPI verification messages and bank alerts. Without this step, nothing else you do fully works. Ask for a replacement SIM with the same number.\n\nStep two: Use “Find My Device” and lock the phone\n\nIf you use Android, sign in to Google’s Find My Device. If you use an iPhone, use Find My iPhone. Lock the phone remotely and display a message with an alternate contact number. If the location looks suspicious or unreachable, remotely erase the phone. Data loss hurts less than identity theft.\n\nStep three: Block UPI across all apps\n\nCall your bank’s customer care and ask for a temporary UPI block, not just an app-level logout. Also email the bank so there is a written record. If you use multiple apps like Google Pay, PhonePe or Paytm, log into each from another device and revoke access. Do not rely only on uninstalling apps remotely.\n\nStep four: Inform your bank and freeze risky access\n\nTell your primary bank that your phone is lost. Ask them to disable mobile banking, reset transaction limits and monitor unusual activity. If your SMS alerts were coming to that phone, ask for email alerts as a backup until the SIM is restored.\n\nStep five: Secure your email first, not last\n\nYour email is the master key. Change your email password immediately and enable two-factor authentication using a new device. Once email is compromised, attackers can reset banking apps, cloud storage and even Aadhaar-linked services.\n\nStep six: Lock down Aadhaar services\n\nLog in to the UIDAI portal and lock your Aadhaar biometrics. This prevents misuse of fingerprint or iris authentication. Also check recent authentication history. If anything looks off, report it immediately.\n\nStep seven: Protect PAN-linked misuse\n\nPAN misuse usually shows up later throughloans,credit cards or fake accounts. Place a watch with credit bureaus so any new credit enquiry triggers an alert. If you spot something unfamiliar, file a complaint early. Delay makes clean-up harder.\n\nStep eight: File a police complaint and keep proof\n\nFile an FIR or online complaint mentioning the phone number, IMEI and time of loss. Banks and regulators often ask for this if fraud occurs later. Keep screenshots of emails, complaint numbers and call logs.\n\nWhat to do once the panic settles\n\nWhen you get your replacement SIM, reset all banking, UPI and email passwords again. Review app permissions, remove unused financial apps and enable app-level locks. Treat this as a forced digital clean-up.\n\nCan someone misuse my UPI if my phone is locked?\n\nYes, especially if the SIM is active. Some attacks rely on OTP interception, app notifications or previously logged-in sessions. Blocking the SIM and UPI together is critical.\n\nShould I block Aadhaar even if my phone had only a PDF copy?\n\nYes. Many services rely on OTP or biometric authentication linked to your number. Locking biometrics adds a strong extra layer of protection.\n\nIs filing a police complaint really necessary?\n\nYes. Even if no money is lost immediately, an FIR helps if fraud shows up weeks or months later. It establishes a timeline and protects you legally."

        "full_content": "Most home loan borrowers aim to repay their loans ahead of schedule to reduce interest costs and shorten the loan tenure. Channelling surplus funds into prepayments, however, also means dipping into your savings.\n\nOpting for a home loan overdraft facility linked to your loan account can help lower interest outgo and loan tenure, while still allowing you to withdraw surplus funds parked in the account when you need them.\n\nBut there is a catch. Lenders usually charge a slightly higher interest rate on homeloanswith an overdraft facility than on standard home loans. Borrowers should carefully weigh the costs and benefits to assess whether the potential interest savings from the overdraft account outweigh higher borrowing costs.\n\nWhat happens after you opt for a home-loan overdraft facility?\n\nOnce you choose a home loan with an overdraft facility, the loan account is linked to your savings or current account. Any amount deposited over and above the EMI is treated as a prepayment, which reduces the outstanding loan balance and lowers the interest charged.\n\nHowever, if you later need this surplus money, you can withdraw it at any time. When you do so, the withdrawn amount is added back to the loan outstanding, which gets rebalanced. As a result, the outstanding loan increases and interest is again calculated on the higher balance, leading to higher interest outgo.\n\nInterest is calculated on a daily reducing balance basis. The bank tracks your account every night and only charges interest on the difference between the total loan and the cash sitting in the overdraft account. While your monthly EMI remains a fixed amount, this facility allows your surplus cash to shrink the interest portion of that payment, forcing a larger share of the instalment to go toward clearing your actual debt.\n\nFor instance, Suresh has an Rs 80 lakh loan at 9 percent interest with a fixed EMI of Rs 81,141. If he deposits Rs 10 lakh into his account on February 15, 2026, the bank only charges interest on Rs 70 lakh for that night; if his balance drops to Rs 2 lakh the next day, the bank immediately adjusts to charge interest on Rs 78 lakh. Consequently, when he pays his March 2026 EMI, the total interest for the previous month falls from Rs 60,000 to Rs 59,300, causing his principal repayment to automatically jump from Rs 21,141 to Rs 21,841.\n\nBenefits of a home loan overdraft account\n\nAny surplus you deposit directly lowers the effective loan outstanding, helping you save a substantial amount of interest over time. The parked funds remain accessible; you can withdraw them whenever required, unlike a one-time prepayment.\n\nWith interest being charged on a lower balance, a larger part of your EMI goes toward repaying the principal, which shortens the loan tenure and reduces the overall cost of borrowing.\n\nWhat is the drawback of a home loan overdraft account?\n\nHome loans that offer an overdraft facility usually carry a slightly higher interest rate; typically about 0.10 percent to 0.30 percent more than standard home loans.\n\nFrom an income tax standpoint, any surplus amount parked in the OD account does not qualify for deductions under Section 80C, since it is not considered a formal prepayment of the loan.\n\nWho should take this facility?\n\nOverdraft-linked home loans are best for individuals who have regular surplus cash flow (such as business owners, self-employed professionals earning variable incomes, or salaried individuals receiving frequent bonuses). These borrowers can easily park their excess funds in their linked savings account to reduce home loan interest costs while maintaining liquidity. This way, they can pay off their loan faster.\n\nShould you take OD or invest that money somewhere else?\n\nWhether you should take a home loan OD or invest the surplus money somewhere else depends on whether the returns on your potential investment (excluding taxes) can frequently exceed your home loan interest rate.\n\n“While home loan OD gives you a guaranteed, risk-free return equivalent to your home interest rate, potential for higher returns on investments over the long term (Mutual Funds, SIPs, etc.) can significantly outpace your home loan interest cost. OD account is best for individuals with low-risk appetite and high-interest-rate loans. It also allows you to deposit surplus funds, reducing the daily loan interest calculation, while keeping your money funds accessible for emergencies,” said Raj Khosla, Founder & Managing Director, MyMoneyMantra.com.\n\n“Investing elsewhere is best suitable for individuals with a long investment horizon, risk takers, and a lower-interest rate loan. If your investment returns are higher than loan interest rate, invest the money. If your loan interest rate is higher than investment returns, consider using an OD account.”"

The index has now fallen around 7 percent in just two sessions, recording biggest single-day fall for the index since March 2020 yesterday.\n\nThe IT stocks which declined up to 8 percent on February 4, declined up to 2 percent today so far, extending losses. Mphasis shares fell 2 percent, while heavyweightInfosysandHCL Technologiesshares fell more than 1 percent each.\n\nCoforge andPersistent Systemsshares fell nearly 1 percent each, whileWipro, Tech Mahindra, LTIMindtree and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares were trading in the red with marginal losses.\n\nWhy are IT stocks falling today?\n\nInvestors remained concerned that AI was creating more competition for software makers, after Anthropic’s launch of a legal tool for its Claude AI chatbot.\n\nAI developer Anthropic launched plug-ins for its Claude Cowork agent last week that can automate tasks across legal, sales, marketing and data analysis. The move has triggered worries of an impending AI-fueled disruption of the data and professional services industry, which were once seen as major beneficiaries of the AI era, according to traders and analysts.\n\nJefferies in its latest note explained that Anthropic’s Cowork plug-ins highlight how AI could erode application services revenue, which accounts for 40–70 percent of IT firms’ topline. The international brokerage added that it sees \"more pain ahead\" for sector.\n\nIT services firms face mounting growth pressure as AI threatens to chip away at core application service lines, Jefferies said, adding that AI will drag on IT firms' revenue growth over the next 1–2 years as deflation in legacy service revenues outweighs emerging AI-led opportunities.\n\n“Anthropic launched new capabilities for its Cowork to the legal space, heightening competition,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Toni Kaplan wrote in a note on Thomson Reuters, as reported by Bloomberg. “We view this as a sign of intensifying competition, and thus a potential negative,\" they said.\n\n“We're looking at a lot of software names that are seen as companies that may well be disrupted when we start to see the advancement of artificial intelligence. We're seeing a lot of software companies across the spectrum get hit,” Reuters quoted Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, as saying.\n\nAnthropic’s launch of advanced AI automation tools, which heightened concerns about potential disruption to traditional software and IT services models, prompted investors to reassess the extent to which generative AI could automate core outsourcing and software functions, triggering broad-based selling across global tech stocks and the Nifty IT index, said Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking.\n\n\"While the sector’s fundamentals remain intact, near-term sentiment is likely to stay volatile as markets gauge the impact on demand and margins.

He also claimed New Delhi had agreed to end purchases of Russian oil.\n\nSoon after Question Hour in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, Goyal said India and the United States have been holding regular and intensive discussions to finalise a balanced, mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement.\n\nGoyal told Parliament that negotiating teams from both sides have worked closely over the past year, engaging at multiple levels to reconcile a wide range of interests. Given the scale and complexity of the talks, he said, it was natural for both countries to safeguard sensitive sectors while seeking the best possible outcome."

Volumes grew by 8% YoY, on higher institutional sales in Gujarat and Mumbai. P&F costs declined on lower power costs, while freight costs fell due to reduced lead distance; which couldn’t negate NSR fall, resulting EBITDA/t of Rs625 (PLe Rs816). Mgmt. indicated that non-trade prices have increased by Rs10-15/bag across regions post Dec’25, with trade prices expected to follow on strong demand momentum and fuel cost inflation. JKLC remains focused on growth via capacity additions while it has demonstrated good progress on the cost front through a higher green power share and operational efficiencies, which should support margins over the long term.\n\nWe cut our estimates for FY27/28E by 2%/1% on lower pricing assumption and expect JKLC to deliver EBITDA/volume CAGR of 21%/10% over FY25-28E.

        "full_content": "The RBI Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is widely expected to hold key rates steady on February 6, maintaining the repo rate at 5.25 percent. For investors, the pause may be a good time to lock in fixed deposit rates pre-empting more cuts down the line.\n\nNilesh Choudhary, Founder and CEO, Aikyam Capital Group, said, “We think the upcoming MPC decision is pivotal for market functioning. A pause in the repo rate would indicate the RBI’s intentions to consolidate the impact of earlier rate easing while prioritising liquidity management and bond market stability.\"\n\nSince the last policy in December, India has sealed trade deals with the EU and the US, which would reduce tariffs on Indian goods to 18 percent from 50 percent. From the highest tariffs, Indian goods will now be taxed at up to 18 percent in the US, among the lowest rates for Asian countries, which will help in improving export competitiveness\n\n“Global economy continues to remain uncertain. Our Geo-Economics Stress Index shows that heightened uncertainty leads to economic stress with a 3-4 month lag. Elsewhere, metal prices have recovered after witnessing a significant sell-off last week,” an SBI research report said.\n\nThe global uncertainty and recent movements in bond yields reduce the case for any immediate policy change, it said.\n\n“...We observe that despite policy rate easing, government bond yields have exhibited persistent hardening in recent periods. We believe that the choice of eligible securities itself may influence the effectiveness of OMO operations, even when the aggregate quantum of liquidity injection is unchanged. RBI is thus likely to maintain the status quo in the upcoming policy,\" the report said.\n\nMarket experts share similar views, citing external risks and volatile capital flows as key concerns ahead of the policy decision.\n\nVinayak Magotra, Product Head and Founding Team, Centricity WealthTech, said the RBI would likely keep rates unchanged. Global conditions remain uncertain, particularly with respect to capital flows, currency movements, and evolving external risks. “Against the backdrop of record capital outflows, any further rate cuts could potentially spur repatriation of rate-sensitive flows,\" he said.\n\nOthers in the financial sector also cited domestic fiscal priorities and policy transmission as reasons to be cautious about rate cuts.\n\nSaurabh Jain, Co-founder and CEO, Stable Money, said based on the Budget’s key focus areas, including continued fiscal support for growth alongside a disciplined approach to public finances, he didn’t expect an immediate rate cut.\n\n\"The focus, for now, is likely to remain on liquidity management and assessing the transmission of past easing rather than on lowering rates immediately,\" he said.\n\nExperts advised investors to prioritise capital safety and stable returns, as interest rates are expected to stay steady.\n\n\"For investors, this pause in monetary easing presents a solid opportunity to lock in prevailing fixed deposit rates before any future rate adjustments. Several small finance banks and niche lenders continue to offer attractive FD rates. For example, Slice SF Bank and Utkarsh Bank are offering around 7.5–7.75% for tenures of under two years, making FDs a compelling option for stable returns,\" said Jain."

        "full_content": "The moment you realise you may have clicked a fake link, shared an OTP, entered card details, or logged in on a suspicious website, it’s best to assume that your information has been compromised. Panic slows people down, but being in denial about it may cost you time. Even if nothing seems wrong yet, phishing damage often shows up hours or days later.\n\nSecure the affected account immediately\n\nStart with the account that has been compromised. If it was an email, banking app, UPI app, social media platform or cloud account, log in through the official app or website and change your password right away. Choose a completely new password, not a variation of the old one. If the account allows it, log out of all other devices so any attacker sessions are forcibly closed.\n\nIf you reused that password elsewhere, change it on those accounts too. Password reuse is one of the most common ways phishing spreads from one account to many.\n\nEnable two-factor authentication everywhere\n\nOnce you are able to change the password, turn on two-factor authentication wherever possible. This adds a second barrier, usually an OTP or authentication app, which can block access even if someone already has your password. For banking, UPI and email accounts, this step is critical.\n\nContact your bank or financial institution\n\nIf the phishing involved card details, net banking, UPI, or wallet access, call your bank’s customer care immediately. Ask them to temporarily block cards, disable UPI, or place additional monitoring on your account. If any unauthorised transaction has already happened, report it right away so you can preserve your rights under banking and RBI timelines.\n\nIf you report the incident quickly, a resolution will more likely to faster.\n\nCheck your devices for malware\n\nPhishing links sometimes install spyware or remote access tools with no obvious signs. Be sure to run a full antivirus and anti-malware scan on your phone, laptop or tablet. And if anything suspicious is detected, remove it immediately. If your device continues to behave oddly, consider backing up essential data and going for a full reset.\n\nWarn your contacts if your account was used\n\nIf your email, WhatsApp or social media account was compromised, attackers may use it to send phishing messages to your contacts. Let people know not to click links or trust messages sent from you recently. Accepting that you have been phished to your family, friends and contacts may be embarrassing with it will prevents the damage from spreading further.\n\nMonitor accounts closely for the next few weeks\n\nReview all your bank statements, credit card bills, UPI history and email security alerts for at least a month after the incident. What you are looking for are small “test” transactions that look suspicious, login alerts from unfamiliar locations, password reset emails that you didn’t\n\nrequest, or even messages that you don’t remember opening marked as “read”. Detecting any of these things early can stop a minor breach from becoming something major such as identity theft.\n\nReport the phishing message or website to the platform involved, such as your bank, email provider or social media service. In India, you can also report financial cybercrime through the national cybercrime portal or helpline. Reporting helps authorities track patterns and may assist if disputes arise later.\n\n1. I clicked a phishing link but didn’t enter any details. Am I still at risk?\n\nYes, it is possible. Some phishing links install tracking scripts or malware automatically. You should still change passwords on sensitive accounts and run a security scan on your device to be safe.\n\n2. Can I recover money lost in a phishing attack?\n\nThat really depends on how quickly you reported the incident and the nature of the transaction. To some extent, banks may reverse unauthorised transactions given that you reported them within a certain timeframe. Any delay in reporting such incidents can reduce those chances significantly.\n\n3. How can I avoid falling for phishing again?\n\nBe cautious of messages that sound urgent, or feel like threats, or things that may be “too good to be true”. Always check website URLs carefully, avoid clicking links in unsolicited messages, and never share OTPs or PINs, no matter how convincing the message appears."

        "full_content": "“This feels like my kid is going to college,” Fractal Analytics Co-founder and CEO Srikanth Velamakanni said as the 25-year-old enterprise artificial intelligence (AI) company is gearing up to get listed on the stock exchanges in two weeks.\n\nFractal has fixed a price band of Rs 857 to Rs 900 per share, taking the IPO valuation to Rs 14,450 crore.\n\nFounded in 2000 by Velamakanni and Pranay Agrawal, the AI company works with large multinational corporations, helping them in decision-making through data-driven insights and end-to-end AI solutions.\n\nIts offerings are organised into two segments. Fractal.ai houses its AI services and products. The products are largely hosted on Cogentiq, its flagship agentic AI platform.\n\nIn an interview withMoneycontrol, he and CFO Ashwath Bhat spoke about the upcoming IPO, business plans, Trump’s India-US trade deal terms and the delays in procuring GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) under the IndiaAI Mission. Velamakanni also spoke about the tech sector's meltdown following Palantir’s approach to agentic AI, adding that it was validation for other AI firms worldwide.\n\nYou have slashed your IPO size by over 42 percent despite the positive outlook for AI services in the Budget and the India-US trade deal announcement that followed. What made you recalibrate pricing?\n\nThe share price was earlier Rs 1,110 for the top band. Now we are doing that at Rs 857 to 900 per share. It is about 18 percent lower than the last valued price.\n\nOf course, I do not like it. We had good advice from our bankers and top fund managers to leave a lot of money on the table for making it attractive. So, this is the price we will go with, based on all the feedback. At that price, our investors wanted to hold on and stay on for much longer.\n\nWe have always been trying to strike a balance between how low we can price versus their investors not being willing to sell. Finally, we found this equilibrium.\n\nOver 60 percent of your revenue comes from the US, where competition with AI companies is increasing, and expenses are going up. How do you plan to differentiate and derisk? What are the challenges expected?\n\nBy staying focused on enterprise AI. While so many exciting AI companies are coming, how many amazing enterprise AI companies have you heard of? Beyond Palantir, name one.\n\nYes, Anthropic AI is beginning to build some enterprise capabilities. So their enterprise API is already being accessed by a lot of companies, but it is still just a starting point. It's not the endpoint.\n\nThere are very few companies that are building enterprise AI significantly. They are all interested in the exciting consumer AI. So, by focusing on enterprise AI, Fractal will continue to stay very relevant for the largest companies on the planet.\n\nWe have started seeing the impact of US-based AI firms like Anthropic and Palantir’s announcements on the Indian IT services industry and its stock prices. Followed by Trump expecting India to go ‘big on buying American’, including technology... As an industry veteran and co-founder of an AI firm, where do you think  this will put India’s technology companies and models?\n\nThis is a wake-up call, and it is good. I fundamentally believe that Indian companies are very innovative. But sometimes they might not do it until they're pushed to a corner. When pushed to a corner, they will do a great job.\n\nIn the last year, Indian tech services companies have already responded. Everyone has repositioned as an AI company. Infosys said they're AI-first since 2022. Everybody is repackaging, repositioning themselves.\n\nThis threat is a blessing in disguise. Though the details of the trade deal is sketchy right now, I'm sure we are not going to be naive in what we agree to, etc.\n\nThere are clearly some things that we can buy from the US. For example, it would be good if we could expand our chip capacity in India or buy more NVIDIA H100, H200, Blackwell chips, etc., to create a greater capacity for AI inferencing and building sovereign AI.\n\nWhat will be your key business focus areas post listing over the next 2-3 years?\n\nBhat:The first, most important one is the Cogentiq platform that we built. We want to take it to the market and grow rapidly.\n\nVelamakanni:What Palantir has shown is a phenomenal proof point of what Cogentiq can and should do.\n\nIt is, in some ways, super validation. Palantir's platform is not even Agentic grounds-up. With more patchwork of things that they've built, they're showing incredible progress.\n\nSo Cogentiq is a very important part of the strategy for Fractal's future growth.\n\nWhat’s the update on your foundational model for IndiaAI Mission? When do you plan to launch? It was earlier planned by 2025-end.\n\nWe don't have the compute yet. We are waiting for the Indian government to give a green light on compute. We are continuing to do our AI R&D meanwhile.\n\nThe government is working on it, but we don't have it. We want to be even more ready when the chips arrive.\n\nWe'll have to train a large model. We don't have the number of chips required to do that. We are paying a large majority of this cost ourselves. Only 40 percent of the costs are being paid by the government,  the remaining 60 percent of the compute and the other costs are paid by us. Of the overall project cost, only 25 percent is being subsidised by the government.\n\nFractal has been granted Rs 120 crore for this project by the government, which will include allocation of Nvidia H100 chips –with a cap of 1400 GPUs being given in a month and on average 700 GPUs in a month.\n\nOur vision is to build a 70-billion-parameter healthcare reasoning model for India and deploy it at India scale with various use cases. We are preparing on all those fronts while we are waiting for the compute.\n\nWe are expecting to launch our model by Independence Day,  August 15, of 2026, if we get the chips soon.\n\nAlso read:Why Fractal Analytics trimmed its IPO size by 42%, CEO Srikanth Velamakanni responds"

        "full_content": "The idea of a “SaaSocalypse”, a term gaining popularity on X to describe the possible decline of traditional software as a service (SaaS)  is no longer limited to online chatter. It has entered boardrooms and investor discussions.\n\nZoho founder and chief architect Sridhar Vembu said the stock market is already turning negative on SaaS companies as AI-assisted coding becomes more powerful.\n\n“Well before the AI revolution, I have said the SaaS industry is ripe for consolidation,” Vembu wrote on the social media platform X, pointing to years of heavy spending on sales and marketing rather than product and engineering.\n\n“The venture capital bubble and then the stock market bubble funded a fundamentally flawed, unsustainable model for too long,” he said. “AI is the pin that is popping this inflated balloon.”\n\nWhy this conversation has intensified now\n\nAI developer Anthropic's launch of a legal AI tool triggered fresh discussions around SaaS disruption.\n\nThe debate has sharpened after recent AI model upgrades that focus on coding and autonomous agents.\n\nThese systems can break down tasks, execute them end-to-end and improve continuously, raising questions about the need for UI-heavy applications.\n\nThe reassessment erased an estimated $285 billion in market value in a single day, reports said. TrendSpider data showed HubSpot was down 72 percent, Atlassian 64 percent, Snowflake 39 percent and Microsoft about 26 percent from their 52-week highs.\n\nInvestors push for reassessment\n\nInvestors say this is the moment when abstract fears are turning concrete.\n\nManav Garg, founding partner at Together Fund, said consolidation in SaaS had been expected for some time but AI automation has made the impact easier to see.\n\n“What has changed is that announcements like this make the implications much more tangible,” Garg told Moneycontrol, referring to Anthropic's AI tool.\n\n“The conversation has shifted from abstract debate to concrete possibility.” He added that SaaS in its traditional form will face a reset and companies will have to adapt or be disrupted.\n\nFounders need to reassess their models quickly\n\n“This feels like a bloodbath. The old playbook of selling seats and workflows just isn’t holding up in an AI world,” said an investor in SaaS and enterprise tech who asked not to be named.\n\n“The market is signalling that products have to think beyond dashboards and clicks, it’s about autonomous value now,” he added.\n\nApp-layer SaaS feels the most heat\n\nMarket data and stock movements suggest that not all software companies face the same level of risk.\n\nAmit Ranjan, co-founder of SlideShare, pointed to a “meltdown in SaaS and software stocks” and highlighted clear patterns.\n\nHe wrote on X that companies doing relatively better tend to operate in data and infrastructure layers, which are harder for AI to replace.\n\n“App-layer SaaS seems most impacted, as AI can replicate UI or features most effectively,” Ranjan said.\n\nHe added that communications tools appear more resilient due to network effects, while inward-facing layers such as data, infrastructure and middleware are relatively safer than customer-facing software.\n\nMarkets care about the future story\n\nEven strong execution has not shielded companies from falling valuations.\n\n“You can execute well, hit the numbers and deliver free cash flow and still watch multiples compress week after week,” Vijay Rayapati, founder and chief executive of Atomicwork, said.\n\nHe added that markets appear less focused on recent performance and more on the story investors want to believe over the next decade. For founders, he said, execution has become table stakes, not a differentiator.\n\nSaaS does not disappear, it changes\n\nOperators argue that AI is not killing SaaS outright but forcing it to evolve quickly.\n\nArvind Parthiban, founder and chief executive of SuperOps, said AI models are challenging products that rely mainly on clicks and workflows.\n\n“Pure UI-driven, workflow-heavy products will struggle if all they do is orchestrate steps,” Parthiban said.\n\nSaaS will shift from tools users operate to systems that do work on their behalf. “Less clicking, more outcomes,” he said.\n\nParthiban also expects pricing models to change, with customers caring less about seats and more about measurable impact such as time saved or issues resolved. “SaaS doesn’t disappear,” he said. “It becomes quieter, more autonomous, and more opinionated.”\n\nFor companies such as Zoho, adaptation is no longer optional.\n\nVembu said survival depends on accepting hard realities. “I always ask our employees to calmly contemplate our death,” he wrote, adding acknowledging this possibility allows teams to plan without fear.\n\nAcross the SaaS ecosystem, founders are rethinking product design, automation depth and where they sit in the software stack. Investors are reassessing defensibility, especially for UI-heavy products."

        "full_content": "The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is widely expected to maintain interest rates  its February policy review, with industry experts flagging the end of the rate-cut cycle and a sharper focus on “liquidity management, transmission efficiency and financial conditions.”\n\nThe MPC is set to meet on February 6, 2026.\n\nWith the RBI having already cut the repo rate by 125 basis points since February 2025,Moneycontrol'spoll of 19 economists, treasury heads and market participants said the central bank now will ensure durable liquidity support to the system.\n\n“Conditions favour policy stability. With inflation well below the target, growth momentum intact, surplus system liquidity, and fiscal consolidation reaffirmed, conditions favour policy stability,” said Deepak Agrawal, CIO - Debt, Kotak Mahindra AMC.\n\n\"Accordingly, the committee is expected to maintain the repo rate unchanged at 5.25 percent,\" Agarwal said. However, he added that forward guidance is likely to remain mildly dovish, underscoring a data-dependent stance and preserving flexibility for recalibration, should the growth-inflation trade-off evolve.\n\nSupportive stance, pause on rates\n\nSeveral industry participants also expect the MPC to continue with a supportive monetary stance, even as policy rates remain unchanged.\n\n“With the RBI having cut the repo rate by 125 basis points since February 2025 and banks gradually reducing deposit rates, the investment environment is turning increasingly favourable for Category II real estate-focused AIFs (Alternate Investment Funds),” said Ankur Jalan, CEO, Golden Growth Fund (GGF).\n\n“We expect the MPC to continue with a supportive monetary stance to ensure adequate liquidity and smoother transmission, which will further enhance the appeal of real estate AIFs for domestic investors seeking stable, risk-adjusted returns while supporting project execution and sectoral stability,” Jain said.\n\nLalit Parihar, Managing Director, Aaiji Group, echoed similar views.\n\n\"We expect the RBI to maintain monetary easing. Given the evolving geo-economic environment and easing domestic inflation, this is an opportune moment to accelerate growth with ample liquidity infusion,\" he said, adding that further easing would improve affordability for homebuyers and support housing demand.\n\nMarket participants, however, also increasingly believe that the policy focus is shifting from interest rates to liquidity conditions and financial transmission.\n\n“The upcoming RBI MPC meeting will be closely watched as markets focus on the central bank’s approach on managing liquidity and financial conditions amid elevated government borrowings and persistent foreign portfolio investor outflows,” said Sachin Sawrikar, Managing Partner, Artha Bharat Investment Managers IFSC LLP.\n\n“Policy effectiveness at this stage relies more on calibrated liquidity management and stable financial conditions, rather than immediate adjustments to interest rates,” added Sawirkar.\n\nHe also added that continued USD purchases by FPIs (Foreign Portfolio Investors), heavy government bond supply and shrinking surplus liquidity are tightening financial conditions, pushing yields higher and constraining credit availability , despite steady policy rates.\n\nA growing consensus among economists and fund managers is that the RBI may have reached the end of its easing cycle.\n\n“Given that there is no pressing concern around growth or inflation, the RBI is expected to hold rates unchanged in its upcoming policy,” Sawrikar said. “A neutral stance is also likely to be maintained, as the central bank may want to keep the option open for one more rate cut if needed. However, for now, it seems we have come to an end of the rate cutting cycle.”\n\nExperts expect liquidity tools such as Open Market Operations (OMOs), and possibly a CRR cut, to take centre stage.\n\nSeveral estimates point to fresh OMO purchases of around Rs 1 lakh crore for the February–March 2026 period to support durable liquidity, as surplus conditions have tightened despite large past injections.\n\nOn inflation, most experts do not expect any immediate revision in projections, with the MPC likely to wait for clearer data under the new CPI (Consumer Price Index) base year.\n\nHeadline CPI remains exceptionally low, at 1.3 percent in December 2025, and has stayed below 2 percent for six consecutive months, driven largely by food deflation.\n\nHowever, economists caution that the new 2024 base year CPI series, starting with the January print, could introduce an upward bias of 20-40 basis points due to higher weights for core components and the inclusion of newer services, such as e-commerce and OTT platforms.\n\nWhile inflation is expected to rise gradually in FY27, most experts believe the RBI will avoid immediate forecast changes until the new series stabilises.\n\nA similar caution is expected on the growth front.\n\nWith GDP (Gross Domestic Product) data shifting to the new base year (2022–23) and revisions underway, experts say the MPC is unlikely to alter growth projections immediately."

        "full_content": "India added three more industries to the existing six industries already part of its Carbon Credit Trading Scheme Petroleum refineries, petrochemicals, and textiles are new sectors. The expansion increases the total number of obligated entities under the Indian Carbon Market’s compliance mechanism to 490. This timing is not random. A carbon tax on imports will begin in Europe this year. Indian exporters of steel, aluminum, and cement to the EU must pay millions of crores in taxes.\n\nSteel exporters in Odisha and cement makers exporting to Rotterdam are primarily concerned with one question: will India's local carbon market protect them from Europe's border tax? The consequences are too significant for a facile response.\n\nThere are two changes facing Indian corporations in 2026. Over 740 large companies in nine industries must reduce carbon emissions under the Indian Carbon Credit Trading Scheme. Polluters must buy carbon credits from cleaner businesses or pay fines. Polluting Indian steel and cement exporters to Europe must pay carbon taxes under Europe's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism starting 1st January, 2026. Ancient Indian blast furnaces emit more carbon than European ones. This might cost the steel industry ₹50,000 crores and the aluminum business hundreds of crores. This high cost may hurt India's European exports.\n\nThe potential exists. The European Union has said that exporters can obtain credit for what they pay at home and not have to pay twice provided their country has its own \"equivalent\" carbon pricing system. It's like having your Indian income tax recognized in other nations so you don't have to pay tax in both places.\n\nBut here's the problem: Europe will only accept \"equivalent\" systems. What does the word \"equivalent\" mean? We don't know all the regulations yet, but we do know some things we need to do:\n\nEurope has a long list of severe rules that India must follow in order to accept its carbon market system. First, corporations that pollute must pay a fair price for their carbon emissions. Next, we need to monitor the amount of pollution that is discharged very precisely and accurately, not just speculate. After that, reliable, independent auditors must review and corroborate this information. Europe also wants to make sure that India's goals for lowering emissions are real and not just for show. Lastly, there must be strict rules with punishments that are expensive enough to ensure everyone respects them.\n\nThe CCTS is India's new carbon trading system, and it has a number of major strengths. First, it includes a lot of big polluting industries, such as steel and cement, that release more than 700 million tonnes of pollutants. Second, CCTS is different from past systems that only tried to save energy. It specifically aims to cut down on greenhouse gases and sets clear goals for each plant. Third, it provides a market where manufacturers that are cleaner get credits to sell, and factories that are worse have to buy those credits or pay a fine. This gives factories a real reason to pollute less. Lastly, the system is meant to get harsher over time, with goals that will get harder every few years to encourage constant improvement. Collectively, these attributes provide CCTS with a legitimate foundation—one that, if reinforced, might establish the groundwork for Europe to acknowledge India's system and mitigate CBAM liabilities for Indian exporters.\n\nThe CCTS, India's new carbon market, might not work very well in a few places. The system's first targets are weak since corporations can reach them by utilizing money-saving tactics that actually increase emissions. This means that the laws aren't really pressing for change. Second, India's system simply sets goals for individual plants, so overall emissions can still go up. This is different from the EU's stringent limit on total pollution. Third, the measuring, reporting, and verification (MRV) criteria are vital, but they come with a lot of expenditures for businesses to follow, which is especially hard for smaller ones. They may not even fulfill European auditing standards. The cost of polluting in India will also be very low—around ₹1,000 per tonne—compared to the EU's cost of about ₹7,500-800 range. This makes one wonder if it will really stop pollution. Last but not least, the system doesn't assist pay for the big, expensive modifications that are needed, such as switching from blast furnaces that pollute a lot to cleaner ones in the steel industry.\n\nThe MSME Crisis Nobody is Talking About\n\nHere's a problem you might not see: Thousands of small and medium-sized exporters don't pollute enough to be covered by CCTS, yet they still have to pay CBAM fees when they export. They can't show that their emissions are low. Europe will use \"default values,\" which means they will assume that factories in the sector emit as much as the worst ones. This makes their goods cost 30 to 40 percent more right away.\n\nThese small firms can't pay the ₹5–10 lakh a year it costs to verify. They don't have any carbon credits to make up for CBAM. They're stuck in the middle: too little for CCTS and too big to ignore CBAM.\n\nWhat does \"equivalent\" really mean?\n\nIndia must achieve certain prerequisites for Europe to recognize its system. First, the emission cutbacks must be real and more than what corporations usually do. Pollution reduction targets must be as tough as European factory targets. India also needs a reliable mechanism for independent auditors to measure, record, and check manufacturing emissions. Polluting companies in India must pay a substantial price to clean up. Finally, a carbon credit used to reduce a European export tax cannot be used to meet India's climate goals. Now, India's system only meets some of these needs, so the remainder must be corrected.\n\nIndia must safeguard exports and industry immediately. Carbon accounting and verification must be modified first. Industry organizations must advocate for the government to give ₹200-300 crores for auditor training and subsidized exporter verification expenses. Second, greater 2027–30 climate goals are needed to encourage clean technology investment beyond repairing aging ones. The government should set a minimum price of ₹1,500-2,000 per carbon credit to prevent market crashes and promote value. Also, the government should support steel plant renovations. To protect trade and regulations, India and the EU must form a working committee now. The government must formulate a specialized support program for small and medium exporters, encompassing emissions assessment, verification, and fundamental abatement strategies. These enterprises are unable to independently absorb CBAM expenditures, and without assistance, thousands may lose access to European markets.\n\nIndia's new carbon market, as it stands now, would not entirely safeguard exporters from Europe's carbon price unless it is made much stronger. The premise is good, but the first phase is about teaching firms rather than punishing them. This could make Europe reject it as a poor \"carbon price lite\" solution. If that happens, Indian exporters will pay the entire European carbon price, making them less competitive. India might compromise with Europe if it quickly establishes a system with precise data, higher goals, and fair carbon pricing. This would be better since Indian companies could pay their carbon taxes at home instead of in Europe, protecting the environment and exports.\n\nIndia's new carbon market won't protect exporters from Europe's carbon tax. To succeed, the government must implement the carbon market, invest in smarter and cleaner technology, and negotiate with other nations. Indian enterprises must pay a carbon tax on items sold in India and exported to Europe. Who gets this money—European governments or Indian regulators to fund our green projects? We must swiftly make our system as robust as Europe's in practice, not just on paper, to keep money in India for renewable energy transformation. Since both systems are operational, the government's next moves will determine whether India wins this high-stakes global contest.\n\n(Owais Ibni Hassan is a researcher at TrustBridge Rule of Law.

HAL confirms that five aircraft are fully ready for delivery, incorporating major contracted capabilities in accordance with the agreed specifications,” the state-run company said in a post on X.\n\nThe clarification followed a report by Economic Times, which said deliveries were likely to miss another deadline and could be pushed beyond May.\n\nHAL wishes to clarify the status of LCA MK1A deliveries to the customer for all stakeholders. HAL confirms that five aircraft are fully ready for delivery, incorporating major contracted capabilities in accordance with the agreed specifications.\n\n— HAL (@HALHQBLR)February 5, 2026\n\nAccording to the report, the aircraft are not yet fit for induction, with avionics integration and final certification still pending. The first batch was initially scheduled for delivery by March 2025, but the timeline was later revised to March 2026—a deadline the report said could be missed again.\n\nShares of HAL were trading 4.76 percent lower at Rs 4,016.30 on the NSE at 11:43 am.\n\nHAL said that, apart from the five aircraft ready for delivery, nine additional Mk1A jets have been built and flown. “Upon receipt of engines from GE Aerospace, these aircraft will be made ready for delivery. All design and development issues identified are being addressed in an expedited manner,” the company said.\n\nThe aircraft maker added that it is in active discussions with the Indian Air Force to expedite deliveries and that the engine supply outlook from GE is “positive”.\n\n“HAL has received five engines from GE as on date. The supply position from GE is positive, and the future delivery outlook aligns with HAL’s delivery plans. HAL assures that it will meet the guidance projected for the current financial year,” the company said.\n\nFacing a widening shortage of combat aircraft, the Indian Air Force has placed orders for 180 fighter jets.

        "full_content": "Silver exchange-traded funds (ETFs)dropped up to 16 percentfrom their highs on February 5 amid a wider sell-off in metals.\n\nAt 10.50 am, Kotak Silver ETF was down 16 percent, Edelweiss Silver 15 percent and HDFC Silver was trading 14 percent lower from the previous session, as silver led the fall in metals.\n\nThe drop in silver ETF prices has been steeper than the decline in the underlying silver price on the MCX.\n\nVarun Gupta, CEO of Groww Mutual Fund, said silver is inherently more volatile in the short term, with prices reacting quickly to global developments, currency fluctuations and shifts in risk sentiment.\n\nConsequently, daily or one or two-day returns may not accurately reflect the performance of a silver ETF.\n\nThe traded price of a silver ETF can be affected by market liquidity, bid–ask spreads and temporary premiums or discounts to iNAV, especially during volatile periods. These short-term trading factors can cause returns to seem more negative or positive than the actual change in silver, he said.\n\nOn MCX, silver experienced a notable correction. The March silver contract declined nearly 9 percent from its recent peak dropping to about Rs 2,45,000 a kilo. The slide reflects weaker momentum in the bullion market, along with a dip in silver ETFs.\n\nSilver ETFs can sometimes perform worse than the metal itself during sharp corrections due to temporary divergences between ETFs’ traded price and iNAV/NAV.\n\nAmid a sharp sell-off and extreme volatility, market liquidity can decrease and bid-ask spreads widen, causing the ETF to trade at a higher discount (when there are more sellers than buyers) or a sudden collapse of premium.\n\nThis can result in the ETF declining more than the underlying silver price movement. On volatile days, exchanges NSE/BSE may impose circuit limits (for instance, ±20 percent based on the previous day’s NAV), which can make the ETF’s intraday price movements appear misaligned from the underlying silver prices.\n\nWhen prices drop sharply, investors often feel compelled to act quickly — either by selling or by comparing short-term returns. For silver, such reactions can be misplaced.\n\n\"When prices fall, investors often misinterpret the situation by assuming a direct one-to-one correlation with global spot silver prices and attributing any discrepancies to 'tracking error’, said Nehal Meshram, senior analyst, manager research, Morningstar Investment Research India.\n\nIn reality, these gaps can result from a combination of factors, including rupee or forex fluctuations, changes in premium/discount levels and execution costs such as spreads or market impact at the time of trade, he said.\n\nAnother frequent misstep is buying after a price surge when the ETF is trading at a premium to its iNAV. During a subsequent correction, this can lead to a double setback — the decline in silver prices coupled with the normalisation of the premium, Meshram said.\n\n\"From an investor perspective, it can be more useful to view silver ETFs as part of a longer-term portfolio allocation, rather than reacting to short-term price movements,\" Gupta said.\n\nEvaluating performance over a longer horizon and in the context of overall portfolio objectives helps put short-term volatility in perspective and allows the strategic role of silver to come through more clearly.\n\nWhen looking at silver ETFs, a few simple factors can help investors make informed decisions\n\nTracking efficiency:How closely the ETF follows silver prices over time. Lower tracking error generally indicates better alignment.\n\nExpense ratio:Lower costs help improve long-term returns.\n\nPrice vs iNAV:Checking whether the ETF trades close to its iNAV can be useful, especially at the time of investment.\n\nLiquidity and fund size:Higher trading volumes and reasonable fund size support smoother buying and selling.\n\nTogether, these factors help investors understand how efficiently a silver ETF provides exposure to silver over time."

        "full_content": "The shares of quick service restaurants (QSR) companies Devyani International and Westlife FoodWorld rallied in trade on February 5 after the companies announced their earnings for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026.\n\nDevyani International, which operates KFC and Pizza Hut outlets in India, saw its shares rally around 9 percent to a three-week high of Rs 133.84 apiece on Thursday.\n\nThe shares of Westlife FoodWorld, which operates McDonald's franchisees in India, rallied nearly 11 percent to Rs 528.90 apiece.\n\nDevyani International Q3 Results:\n\nDevyani International on February 4 reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 10.39 crore for Q3 FY26, as compared to a net loss of Rs 49.20 lakh in the same quarter of the previous financial year. The firm’s net loss however narrowed sequentially from the Rs 21.9 crore reported in Q2 FY26.\n\nThe company’s revenue from operations rose more than 11 percent to Rs 1,440.9 crore during the quarter under review.\n\nDevyani Internationalreported 95 net new store additions in the quarter, with 54 net additions to KFC India and 18 net additions to Pizza Hut. “We have also started the process of turnaround of the Pizza Hut business by rationalizing loss-making stores. Our idea is to bring a sharper focus to this exercise and therefore we will open new stores only to compensate for the closure of loss-making stores. This will also help us to utilize the existing assets and equipment in our new stores and bring down the capex for the new openings as well,” said Devyani International Non-Executive Chairman Ravi Jaipuria.\n\n“DIL is at a critical inflection point in its growth journey, as we prepare to scale into a larger, more diversified and more complex organization. The Board believes that this next phase requires a bold strategic vision, backed by strong execution capability. Accordingly, Manish Dawar shall get elevated as President and CEO for DIL with effect from April 1, 2026,” he added.\n\nThe company had announced the results in the market hours of Wednesday. The stock had jumped more than 6 percent yesterday, and is extending gains today.\n\nJPMorgan remained ‘overweight’ on the stock, with a target price of Rs 155 apiece. It said that the firm’s EBITDA beat estimates on better margins. It added that same-store sales trends improved sequentially, turning positive in January for most formats.\n\nGoldman Sachs kept a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 160 apiece. The international brokerage flagged positive January same-store sales but said it is \"too early\" to call it a sustained recovery.\n\nUBS kept a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 170 apiece. The international brokerage sees an \"emerging turnaround\" for the company, helped by pricing, promotions and product interventions. It added that improving profitability in KFC and a rationalised Pizza Hut network could aid growth.\n\nWestlife FoodWorld Q3 Results:\n\nWestlife FoodWorldon February 5 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 1.02 crore for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. This marks an 85 percent YoY fall from the Rs 7.01 crore net profit reported in the same period of the previous financial year.\n\nThe earnings were however impacted by a one-time exceptional cost of Rs 9.69 crore arising out of the new labour codes which took effect last year.\n\n“Amidst an ongoing challenging operating environment, the company prioritized driving affordability through its value platform while maintaining strict execution discipline. Westlife reported revenue of ₹6.71 billion for Q3 FY26, at the back of recovering guest counts. Same Store Sales Growth (SSSG) was at -3.2% for the quarter. However, positive momentum carried into January, with positive SSSG driven by a mid-single digit increase in guest counts,” the firm said.\n\nBrokerage BOB Capital Markets says WEST is at early stages of a guest-count-led recovery, driven by sharper everyday value proposition and improved dine-in execution.\n\nMacquarie said that the company saw positive same-store-sales growth on a mild single-digit drop in guest counts in January as it focused on affordability and product innovations. JPMorgan meanwhile noted that McDelivery platform has seen strong growth supported by customer acquisition and growth investments, seeing significant traction in December and January.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom Q3 Results here."

The modest growth came amid improved demand following tax cuts, partly offset by a one-time labour-related charge.\n\nTrent reported an exceptional item (net loss) of Rs 26.11 crore during the quarter due to the implementation of new Labour Codes.\n\nShares ofTrentwere trading at Rs 4,099.10 pe share on the NSE, up 2.16 percent, around 11:20 am.\n\nRevenue from operations rose 14.78 percent to Rs 5,345.06 crore in the December quarter, from Rs 4,656.56 crore a year earlier, the company said.\n\n\"The gross margin profile of Westside and Zudio remains stable. Operating EBIT margin for Q3FY26 was 13.8 percent, compared with 13.2 percent in Q3FY25,\" Trent said.\n\nDuring the quarter, the company opened 17 Westside and 48 Zudio stores, taking the total store count to 278 Westside and 854 Zudio outlets as of December 31, 2025. This includes four Zudio stores in the UAE. Trent also operates 32 stores across other lifestyle concepts.\n\nAs of December 31, the company had a presence across 274 cities, with a footprint of over 15 million square feet and a portfolio of more than 1,100 large-format fashion stores.\n\nBrokerages maintained a mixed stance on the stock. Bernstein, which has an ‘Outperform’ rating with a price target of Rs 5,000, said Trent’s growth rebound is still unfolding, with store additions, rather than like-for-like sales, expected to drive performance in the coming quarters. HSBC retained a ‘Buy’ rating with a target price of Rs 5,300, citing expected margin gains by FY27 led by sourcing efficiencies and cost optimisation.\n\nKotak, however, maintained a ‘Reduce’ rating with a fair value of Rs 3,850, warning that pressure on same-store sales growth may persist through FY26 due to soft demand and higher costs. It expects only moderate revenue growth into FY27.\n\nCommenting on the results, Chairman Noel N Tata said the fashion business registered category-leading growth during the quarter. \"Customer sentiment is gradually improving and our business outlook for the medium term continues to remain positive. Our focus remains on portfolio growth, improving products and enhancing store experience,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the company remains committed to strengthening its direct-to-customer business across segments, supported by its focus on relevance and resilience in its business model.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "Cancer treatment costs in India are rising sharply, with prolonged care and high out-of-pocket expenses continuing to place significant financial strain on patients and their families, according to claims data released by Care Health Insurance on World Cancer Awareness Day.\n\nAn analysis of the insurer’s claims shows that early-stage cancer treatment typically costs between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 7 lakh per case, while expenses for high-complexity and advanced cancers can escalate to Rs 20–30 lakh per treatment. Costs vary depending on disease progression, treatment protocols, intensity of care, and the duration of therapy, the company said.\n\nThe findings come at a time when the Union Budget 2026 has reiterated the government’s focus on improving access to affordable cancer care and reducing the financial burden on patients.\n\nCancer treatment in India often follows a prolonged, multi-stage pathway, with patients filing multiple claims over several months. While chemotherapy and radiotherapy are largely covered as day-care procedures, hospitalisation requirements differ widely based on treatment complexity. Lengths of stay range from three days to as long as 20 days in certain cases, the data showed.\n\n“Cancer treatment is not only medically complex but also involves prolonged and multi-stage care pathways, often extending over several months,” said Manish Dodeja, chief operating officer at Care Health Insurance.\n\nThe insurer’s claims experience also points to wide variations in financial exposure across cancer types. Claims related to breast, oral, cervical, prostate and blood cancers, as well as advanced pancreatic and liver cancers, showed differing claim values. In several cases, policyholders breached coverage limits where the sum insured was relatively low, leading to higher out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nBased on observed trends, Care Health Insurance said coverage adequacy is emerging as a critical gap. The analysis suggests that a minimum sum insured of Rs 15–25 lakh is increasingly required to adequately cover comprehensive cancer treatment, particularly in advanced-stage cases or those involving prolonged care.\n\nThe company added that comprehensive health insurance coverage—such as higher sums insured, no-claim bonus benefits, absence of sub-limits, access to a cashless hospital network and critical illness-specific covers—can play a key role in reducing financial stress and ensuring continuity of care.\n\n“As treatment approaches evolve and become more accessible over time, it is important for consumers to periodically reassess their health insurance coverage to ensure it provides adequate financial security through the course of care,” Dodeja said."

You can email your queries to askwalletwise@nw18.com, and we will try to get a top financial expert to address.\n\nI am a senior citizen who has invested in shares of various companies and nominated two children. In the event of my death, is there an option for one of my children to continue to invest in one of the stocks and the other child to sell his part of the share?\n\nExpert’s Advice: There is a difference between being a nominee and a legal heir. Nomination is generally done to facilitate the quick transfer of the assets in the name of the nominee. A nominee does not become an owner of the assets after the death of the original owner or shareholder of the asset. The nominee acts as trustee for the legal heirs of the deceased and is answerable to the legal heirs and has to account for the assets received by him as nominee.\n\nFor a smooth succession of your assets, it is advised that you make a valid will and get it registered, though registration of a will is not mandatory. Since you wish one of your children to continue to hold the shares after your demise, you can provide for the same in the will, stating that the particular son shall become the full owner of all the shares by paying 50 percent of the market value of the shares inherited to the other son.\n\nPlease note, this transaction of getting 50 percent of the market value of the shares inherited will have income tax implications for the son selling 50 percent of the inherited shares. Instead of providing for payment of 50 percent market value of the shares, you can provide that 50 percent shares shall be distributed to each brother and thus avoid the tax liability."

        "full_content": "Soon after the presentation of the Union Budget 2026–27, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) released its official press statement, highlighting, among others, that its “allocation [Rs 7.85 lakh crore] stands at 2% of the estimated [gross domestic product] GDP” for the coming fiscal year.\n\nThe reference to the GDP is not without significance. After all, when the previous Union Budget was unveiled in February 2025, the defence allocation had fallen to 1.91% of the then estimated GDP, causing some anxiety within the defence establishment and among the strategic community. But why is the reference to an innocuous figure like GDP important, and what does it entail?\n\nDefence’s share in GDP represents the proportion of a country’s wealth devoted to its security. If a country’s GDP consists of, say, only 100 vehicles or horses in a particular year, a 2% allocation of GDP for defence in that year would mean that its security forces get only two vehicles or horses to protect the country.\n\nSuffice it to say that the entire GDP is not available to the government for spending; rather, only a fraction of it flows into the government’s budget through various tax and non-tax measures. The latest Union Budget, for instance, amounts to just 14% of the estimated GDP for 2026–27.\n\nIn academic literature, the defence–GDP ratio is acknowledged as a defence burden, as the resources devoted to defence are not available for spending on welfare activities for taxpayers.\n\nNo Universal Benchmark for Defence Burden\n\nThere is no uniform norm regarding what should constitute an appropriate defence burden or defence–GDP ratio for a country. The ratio varies from country to country, depending on its security environment and defence strategy.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), which tracks military expenditure in more than 170 countries worldwide, the defence–GDP ratio ranged from as low as 0.24% in Ireland to as high as 34.48% in Ukraine in 2024. This wide variation reflects the very different security environments in which these countries operate.\n\nFigure 1 depicts military expenditure as a percentage of GDP for select countries, including India, based on SIPRI’s military expenditure database. It is worth noting that SIPRI’s military expenditure figure for India is overestimated, as it includes the expenses of several paramilitary forces—such as the Border Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force, Assam Rifles, Indo-Tibetan Border Police, and Sashastra Seema Bal—which do not fall under the MoD’s purview and are therefore not part of India’s official defence budget.\n\nDefence–GDP Ratio: A Downward Trend\n\nFigure 2 shows India’s defence expenditure—as accounted for by the MoD—as a proportion of GDP since 2009–10. Barring a spike in 2020–21, the overall trend has been on a downward trajectory.\n\nShould India’s declining defence–GDP ratio be a cause for concern? Should the ratio be fixed at an elevated level, comparable to that of other countries such as the United States, Russia or even Pakistan? Or should India emulate China, which has a much lower defence burden than India, even though in absolute terms it outspends India by a wide margin? In 2024, China’s military expenditure of $314 billion was nearly four times that of India.\n\nWhy the Ratio Matters Less Than Capability\n\nIndia’s declining defence–GDP ratio need not be a concern as long as the MoD receives adequate resources through the annual Union Budget to meet its operational and modernisation requirements. However, given the scarcity of resources and competing demands from various socio-economic sectors, it is not surprising that the MoD’s annual budgets often fall short of its expectations.\n\nWhat matters most, therefore, is the extent of shortages faced by the MoD in running its vast security apparatus. Needless to mention, the higher the shortages, the greater their adverse impact on the country’s defence preparedness.\n\nThe ideal way to address these shortages is through resource augmentation rather than by committing to a fixed share of GDP. A fixed share of GDP does not necessarily guarantee a steady increase in defence spending, as a contraction in GDP—as witnessed in India in 2020–21—can result in a smaller defence budget than that of the previous year.\n\nCase for Predictable and Steady Increases\n\nIn recent years, several countries have announced plans to raise their defence spending to a specified share of GDP. In June 2025, for instance, members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) committed to increasing their core defence spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2035.\n\nThis commitment must be viewed in the context of European NATO members’ long-standing free-riding on US military power in the post-Cold War era. With President Trump showing scant respect for the transatlantic military alliance, European NATO countries have little option but to spend their way towards greater defence preparedness. Put differently, NATO’s June 2025 commitment reflects an American insistence that its allies bear a higher defence burden and take greater responsibility for European security.\n\nIndia, being part of no military alliance, carries no such free-rider label. It can calibrate its defence spending to best serve its security requirements without undue concern over the precise share of GDP devoted to defence.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that annual increases in defence spending should be subject to wide fluctuations, as has often been the case. Over the past decade, the year-on-year increase in MoD expenditure has ranged from as low as 3% to as high as 15%. Given that defence modernisation involves long gestation periods and capability development takes years to materialise, what is required is a steady and predictable increase in annual spending—particularly on the capital side of the defence budget.\n\n(Laxman Kumar Behera is Associate Professor at Special Centre for National Security Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), New Delhi.)\n\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication."

The world’s largest cryptocurrency was trading at $71,296 at 9.04 am, down 6.68 percent over the past 24 hours and nearly 18.81 percent over the week, as investors stayed cautious despite the US government ending its partial shutdown.\n\n“The current volatility reflects broader macro sensitivity rather than any crypto-specific weakness. Geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran are also keeping risk appetite in check, though ongoing dialogue offers scope for sentiment to improve. A reclaim of the $75,000 zone would signal renewed strength, while $71,000 remains a key support,\" said Akshat Siddhant, Lead quant analyst, Mudrex.\n\nAccording to CoinSwitch Markets Desk, \"As price slipped below the $73K–$74K support zone, it entered an area of dense long leverage, triggering forced liquidations and accelerating downside momentum, effectively pulling BTC toward the $72K liquidity pocket. Unless BTC reclaims $75K, near-term risk stays skewed to further downside or volatile consolidation.\"\n\nOther cryptocurrencies traded lower too. Ethereum was down 7.28 percent, tether 0.05 percent, solana 8.12 percent, BNB 8.42 percent, XRP 9.17 percent, Tron 1.73 percent, Dogecoin 4.91 percent. USDC gained 0.01 percent in the past 24 hours.\n\nHere's how the prices of top-10 cryptocurrencies have moved on February 5, as of 9:04 am IST.\n\nAccording to Piyush Walke, Derivatives Research Analyst, Delta Exchange, cryptocurrencies continue to face sustained pressure, reflecting ongoing cross-asset stress. Currency movements and interest-rate differentials are increasingly shaping market behaviour, influencing leverage conditions, stablecoin flows, and overall sentiment. While the initial phase of the sell-off was driven by crypto-specific liquidations, the pressure seen on Wednesday reflects broader cross-asset stress.\n\nHere's what's happening in the crypto market, according to Nischal Shetty, Founder, WazirX."

This came after gold and silver prices were rebounding for the last two sessions following a sharp slump earlier.\n\nSilver saw a sharper fall today, with its ETFs crashing up to 16 percent in the early trading hours of Thursday.\n\nGold futures with April expiry fell around 3 percent to Rs 1,48,455 per 10 grams on Thursday. The contracts with June expiry also fell around 3 percent.\n\nSilver futures with March expiry dropped 11 percent to Rs 2,39,000 per kilogram.

Edelweiss Gold ETF, Choice Gold ETF,Axis MF Gold ETF, DSP Gold ETF, ICICI Prudential Gold ETF, 360 One Gold ETF, SBI Gold ETF and few others fell around 5 percent each.\n\nToday's fall may have been driven by profit booking after two days of gains.\n\nMarkets are now focused on US ADP non-farm payrolls data and final services PMI readings from major global economies, said Kaynat Chainwala, AVP Commodity Research, Kotak Securities. However, the analyst added that the primary focus remains on Friday’s official US jobs report for signals on the timing of the next Federal Reserve rate cut.\n\n“CME FedWatch currently shows no easing priced in until May, with June reflecting just a 44.1% probability of a 25bp cut versus a 44.9% chance of rates being held unchanged,” Chairwala said.\n\nThe \"flash crash\" in gold and silver, triggered by a hawkish US Fed nominee and increased margin requirements, is viewed by many as a necessary cooling of \"overbought\" markets rather than a trend reversal, said Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza.\n\nHe however noted that the long-term outlook remains structurally bullish, despite the volatility. “Record central bank buying, silver’s persistent supply deficit, and geopolitical tensions provide a solid floor,” he said.\n\n“We have maintained a cautious stance on silver following its parabolic move and have suggested trimming overallocation to precious metals to realign portfolios with long-term strategic allocation levels. While it is prudent to wait for further information and trend confirmation, we currently prefer gold from a relative risk-reward perspective,” said Siddharth Srivastava, Head - ETF Product & Fund Manager, Mirae Asset Investment Mangers (India).\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here."

        "full_content": "If you have foreign income or overseas assets that were not disclosed in your income tax return, it is important to correct the omission at the earliest. The Union Budget 2026 has introduced a voluntary disclosure scheme to enable taxpayers to disclose foreign asset or income that were either not offered to tax in earlier years or not reported in schedule FA of ITR.\n\nThe scheme is primarily intended to provide relief to small taxpayer (e.g. student, employee, relocated non-resident, etc.) who may hold foreign asset or derived foreign income (e.g. foreign bank account, ESOP, retirement account, etc.) but failed to comply with reporting or tax requirements in the past.\n\n“To address practical issues of small taxpayers like students, young professionals, tech employees, relocated NRIs, and such others, I propose to introduce a one-time 6-month foreign asset disclosure scheme for these taxpayers to disclose income or assets below a certain size,” FM said in the Budget speech.\n\n“This scheme is a golden opportunity for the people who have missed (inadvertently/intentionally) declaring foreign undisclosed assets and income. By doing so, not only the payment of penalty and prosecution can be avoided, but also unnecessary litigation costs can be avoided as well,” said Shashank Sharma, Tax Counsel, Supreme Court.\n\nWho is eligible for this scheme?\n\nThe scheme would be applicable to taxpayers who did not disclose their overseas income or assets and those who disclosed their overseas income and/or paid due tax, but could not declare the assets acquired.\n\n“The scheme offers a clean exit through voluntary compliance, granting immunity from prosecution once the prescribed payment is made. It is a one-time opportunity to close past lapses and avoid severe consequences under the Black Money framework,” said Alay Razvi, Managing Partner, Accord Juris.\n\nWhat types of income or assets can be disclosed under the Scheme?\n\nThe Scheme covers— undisclosed foreign income; undisclosed assets located outside India; and\n\nspecified foreign assets acquired from foreign income when assessee was a nonresident or from income already offered to tax in India, which have not been reported in the relevant Schedule of the return of income.\n\nThe Scheme does not apply to income or assets representing proceeds of crime under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, or to cases where assessment proceedings under the Black Money Act have already been completed.\n\nThe scheme has two categories under which amnesty is allowed\n\nCategory A: For complete non-disclosure (up to Rs 1 crore value). Reportable items include undisclosed income from dividends, shares, or any other asset.\n\nCategory B: For the taxpayers who disclosed the income and paid tax, but didn’t declare the asset acquired, the limit proposed is up to Rs 5 crore. Reportable items cover foreign bank accounts, stocks, ESOPs/RSUs, real estate, financial interests, or signing authority abroad, even if no income was generated.\n\nWhat are the cost implications?\n\nCategory A: The declarant is required to pay tax at the rate of 30 percent of the value of the undisclosed foreign asset as on 31 March 2026 or of the undisclosed foreign income, as the case may be, together with an additional amount equal to 100 percent of such tax. The total amount payable will be 60 percent of the value of the asset or foreign income, as the case may be.\n\nCategory B: In case where the foreign asset was acquired from explained sources but not reported in Schedule FA, the taxpayer may regularise the disclosure by paying a flat fee of Rs 1 Lakh per asset. Where non-reporting spans multiple years, the fee will be levied only for the first year of non-disclosure for each asset.\n\nWhat happens when you miss the deadline?\n\n“The six-month window (Scheme shall come into force on such date as may be notified by the Central Government in the Official Gazette) offers immunity only if met; missing it triggers Black Money Act consequences like 30 percent tax on undisclosed income, up to 3x penalty (120 percent), Rs 10 lakh annual non-disclosure fine per asset/year, and 6 months to 7 years imprisonment. Assessments can reopen up to 16 years; no Double Tax Avoidance Agreement relief is available,” said Divya Alexander, Advocate, D.M. Harish & Co.\n\nWhat difference does it make to pay under this scheme?\n\nSuppose Suresh received dividends worth Rs 40 lakh from foreign stocks but did not pay tax. If action is taken under the Black Money Act, he would be liable to a penalty of Rs 10 lakh, a 30 percent flat tax of Rs 12 lakh, and an additional penalty equal to 300 percent along with the continued risk of prosecution. In comparison, if Suresh declares the income under the proposed scheme, he would have to pay a consolidated penalty of 60 percent of the income, or Rs 24 lakh, and would receive immunity from prosecution, making the scheme a far more attractive option.\n\nHow to disclose foreign income under Foreign asset disclosure scheme\n\n“The Central Government will notify the date from which the scheme will come into force, the last date for filing declaration and procedure for making such declaration,” said Gopal Bohra, Partner -Tax, N.A.Shah Associates."

        "full_content": "Gold rose, pushing back above $5,000 an ounce, as dip buyers continued to snap up bullion after a historic plunge from an all-time high.\n\nSpot gold climbed as much as 1.2% in early trading, having clawed back some losses over the previous two sessions following an abrupt collapse. At Wednesday’s close, the metal was down 11% from an all-time high hit on Jan. 29 but was still up 15% for the year. Silver also advanced, crossing $90 an ounce.\n\nPrecious metals soared last month in a rally underpinned by speculative momentum, geopolitical upheaval and concerns about the Federal Reserve’s independence. The surge came to a sudden halt at the end of last week, with silver seeing its biggest ever daily drop on Friday and gold plunging the most since 2013.\n\nStill, many investors and analysts believe the fundamentals that drove bullion to record highs remain intact. Fidelity Fund, which sold a chunk of gold holdings days before the plunge, is watching for an opportunity to buy again, portfolio manager George Efstathopoulos told Bloomberg News.\n\nMany banks have backed gold to recover, with Deutsche Bank AG saying on Monday that it was standing by its forecast for bullion to rally to $6,000 an ounce. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a note that it sees “significant upside risk” to its year-end forecast of $5,400.\n\nTraders are now turning their attention to the policy direction of Kevin Warsh, who was nominated by US President Donald Trump to be the next Fed chair. Trump said on Wednesday he would not have nominated Warsh had he expressed a desire to hike interest rates. A lower rate environment is a tailwind for precious metals, which don’t pay interest.\n\nSpot gold rose 1.2% to $5,022.61 an ounce as of 7:50 a.m. in Singapore. Silver climbed 2.3% to $90.20. Platinum and palladium also advanced. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a gauge of the US currency, was steady after ending the previous session up 0.3%."

        "full_content": "Equity benchmarks extended their uptrend for the third consecutive session, with the Nifty 50 rising 0.2 percent amid healthy market breadth on February 5. A total of 2,012 shares saw buying interest compared to 911 shares that were backed by bears. Consolidation with range-bound trading may continue over the next couple of sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:\n\nNilesh Jain, VP- Equity Technical & Derivative Research at Centrum Broking\n\nHero MotoCorp| CMP: Rs 5,851.5\n\nHero MotoCorp has broken out of a falling channel on the daily chart and has also decisively moved above its 50-DMA at Rs 5,836. With this breakout, it is now trading well above both its short-term and long-term moving averages, indicating sustained strength.\n\nFrom a derivatives perspective, the addition of fresh long positions, with open interest rising by around 6 percent, further reinforces the positive bias.\n\nConsidering the overall technical setup, a conservative upside target is placed near the Rs 6,300 level in the near term, while crucial support is seen at Rs 5,670.\n\nSarda Energy & Minerals| CMP: Rs 521.35\n\nSarda Energy has registered a fresh breakout from a descending triangle pattern on the daily chart. The sharp price up-move is accompanied by a notable surge in volumes, which validates the bullish breakout. Earlier, the stock had formed a double-bottom pattern near the Rs 455 level and witnessed a strong rebound from that base.\n\nMomentum indicators are also aligned with the positive bias, as the RSI has moved above the 60 mark and the MACD has generated a bullish crossover, signalling improving upside momentum. Overall, the technical structure indicates that the stock is well positioned to move toward the Rs 555 level in the near term, while immediate support at the 200-DMA is placed near Rs 499.\n\nCCL Products| CMP: Rs 1,002.85\n\nCCL Products (India) has witnessed a strong breakout from an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily chart. The move is backed by higher-than-average volumes, lending credibility to the breakout and highlighting strong buying interest. Additionally, the stock is trading firmly above all its short-term moving averages, which reinforces the bullish momentum.\n\nBased on the pattern projection, the potential upside target is placed around the Rs 1,075 level, while the neckline near Rs 961 is likely to act as an important support zone on any pullback.\n\nSudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities\n\nSteel Authority of India| CMP: Rs 157.29\n\nSAIL has staged a strong rebound from its 50-day EMA, reinforcing the prevailing uptrend. On the daily chart, the stock continues to form a higher top–higher bottom structure, signalling sustained bullishness. The RSI has bounced from 53 to 62, reflecting improving momentum. The DI+ crossover above DI- on the ADX indicator highlights strengthening trend support.\n\nWith prices holding near the upper Bollinger Band, the stock appears well positioned to extend its upward move in the near term. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 158–156 with a stop-loss at Rs 152. On the upside, it is likely to test the Rs 168 level in the short term.\n\nMax Financial Services| CMP: Rs 1,708.2\n\nMax Financial Services has rebounded sharply from its key upward-sloping trendline support, drawn by connecting the lows of Rs 1,451 and Rs 1,502 formed on August 4 and October 27, 2025, respectively. The stock now trades above its key short- and long-term moving averages. The RSI has surged from 31 to 60 in just seven sessions, signalling strong bullish momentum.\n\nThe DI+ crossover above DI- on the ADX indicates bulls gaining control, while the MACD has crossed above its signal line, supporting further upside potential. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,715–1,705 with a stop-loss at Rs 1,660. On the upside, it is likely to test the Rs 1,830 level in the short term.\n\nLarsen & Toubro| CMP: Rs 4,087.1\n\nLarsen & Toubro has staged a strong rebound from its 200-day EMA on the daily chart, signalling a shift in trend. The RSI has recovered sharply from an oversold level of 24 to 61, indicating strengthening bullish momentum. Rising MACD histogram bars further support the positive bias. The Infra index has moved from the lagging to the improving quadrant on the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG), highlighting improving sector-wide momentum, with L&T leading the move.\n\nStrong price action and sectoral momentum suggest the stock is well placed to extend its uptrend. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 4,090–4,050 with a stop-loss at Rs 3,920. On the upside, it is likely to test the Rs 4,400 level in the short term.\n\nRupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities\n\nHindalco Industries| CMP: Rs 965\n\nHindalco Industries has been sustaining above the 20 EMA after a brief corrective move. On the hourly chart, it has witnessed a consolidation breakout, indicating improving optimism. The hourly RSI is in a bullish crossover, pointing to positive momentum.\n\nOn the upside, the stock may move towards Rs 1,020. On the downside, immediate support is placed at Rs 939; a breach below this level could weaken the trend.\n\nMahindra and Mahindra Financial Services| CMP: Rs 370\n\nMahindra & Mahindra Financial Services has formed a piercing line pattern on the daily chart, indicating the possibility of a bullish reversal. It continues to sustain above the 50 EMA on the daily timeframe.\n\nThe RSI is in a bullish crossover and is trending higher, reflecting strengthening momentum. On the upside, the stock may move towards the Rs 385–400 zone. On the downside, support is placed at Rs 358; a break below this level could weaken the trend.\n\nCaplin Point Laboratories| CMP: Rs 1,909.5\n\nCaplin Point Laboratories has undergone a healthy consolidation on the daily chart, suggesting rising optimism. Additionally, it has been sustaining above the 20 EMA. The RSI is in a bullish crossover and continues to rise, indicating positive momentum.\n\nOn the upside, the stock may head towards the Rs 1,970–2,000 zone. On the downside, support is placed at Rs 1,875; a break below this level could weaken the trend."

In terms of numbers, the exports to the US stood at Rs 2,594.6 crore of total exports finished goods of Rs 3,130 crore in FY25, rising sharply from Rs 1,693.2 crore of Rs 1,955.2 crore in FY24.\n\nThe US tariff impact reflected in the quarterly numbers of October-December 2025. Profit fell sharply by 71 percent to Rs 14.6 crore, down from Rs 50.3 crore in the corresponding quarter of previous fiscal, though revenue saw a marginal decline of 0.92 percent to Rs 978.65 crore against Rs 987.76 crore in the same quarters.\n\nThe company reported an EBIDTA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of Rs 96 crore (falling 18 percent YoY) with margins at 9.7 percent (down 202 bps YoY) in Q3FY26, impacted mainly due to US tariff rebates, the company in its filing said.\n\nMeanwhile, BNP Paribas Financial Markets has exchanged shares ofAditya Birla Capital,Federal Bank,Indian Bank, andNational Aluminium Companywith Societe Generale via block deals on the BSE.\n\nBNP Paribas Financial Markets has acquired 20.91 lakh shares (0.07 percent stake) in Aditya Birla Capital at Rs 344 per share for Rs 71.93 crore from Societe Generale, while Societe Generale sold 31 lakh shares (0.12 percent stake) in Federal Bank at Rs 287 per share for Rs 88.97 crore to BNP Paribas Financial Markets.\n\nBNP Paribas Financial Markets has bought 6.18 lakh shares (0.02 percent stake) in Indian Bank at Rs 873 per share for Rs 53.95 crore, and 11.2 lakh shares (0.06 percent stake) in National Aluminium Company at Rs 374 per share for Rs 41.88 crore from Societe Generale.",

        "full_content": "A digital savings account is exactly what it sounds like — a bank account that you open, operate and manage completely online. There is no need to go to a branch, submit physical forms or wait days for activation. In most cases, you can open a digital account by using Aadhaar-based verification or video KYC. You can even start transacting within minutes.\n\nOver the past few years, especially after UPI transformed everyday payments, more Indians have become comfortable handling money through payment apps. That shift in behaviour is one of the biggest reasons digital savings accounts are growing rapidly.\n\nWhat makes a savings account “digital”?\n\nDigital accounts are regular savings accounts that come under the purview of the Reserve Bank of India. Your deposits are insured up to Rs 5 lakh under DICGC rules, just like any other bank account.\n\nThe difference lies in how it is opened and managed.\n\nYou complete KYC online through Aadhaar OTP authentication or live video verification. Documents are uploaded digitally. Account details are sent via email or SMS. Debit cards, if issued, are delivered by courier. Many banks also offer virtual debit cards instantly for online use.\n\nSome digital accounts are offered directly by traditional banks, while others are offered in partnership with fintech platforms. In either case, the account ultimately sits with a regulated bank.\n\nWhy are more Indians choosing digital accounts?\n\nThe biggest factor that is attracting Indians to digital banks is convenience. While opening a traditional savings account often means taking time off work, standing in a queue and filling multiple forms, with a digital account, the entire process can be completed in 10-20 minutes in the comfort of your home or office.\n\nAnother factor that makes these banks attractive are the low balance requirements. For many digital savings accounts, you can start with zero balance or very low minimum balance, making them a bank of choice if you are a student, gig worker and first-time earner.\n\nCost is also a consideration. For some digital accounts, there is no debit card fees, no extra charge for SMS while some also offer better cashbacks and rewards on UPI, bill payments and card spending.\n\nFinally, speed matters. If you go for a digital savings account, you can instantly transfer funds through UPI, IMPS and NEFT, quickly create a fixed deposit and your investment apps are seamlessly linked to the savings account, making them more flexible than traditional branch-based banking.\n\nA digital savings account still comes with standard banking rules. If you opt for a zero-balance account, there may be limits on free ATM withdrawals or certain services. Some accounts may initially have limited features until full KYC is completed.\n\nYou also need to be more careful about cybersecurity. Since everything happens through your phone, strong passwords, device security and two-factor authentication become critical.\n\nDigital banking offers ease. But that ease comes with responsibility. Importantly, digital banks are not replacing traditional banking entirely, but for many Indians, especially younger and tech-savvy users, they have become the default way to start banking.\n\n1. Is a digital savings account safe?\n\nYes, as long as it is opened with a regulated bank. Deposits are insured up to ₹5 lakh under the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation scheme. The key risk is cyber fraud, so users must protect login credentials and enable security features.\n\n2. Do digital savings accounts offer lower interest rates?\n\nNot necessarily. Most digital savings accounts offer the same interest rates as the bank’s regular savings account. In some cases, promotional rates may even be slightly higher, but always check the fine print.\n\n3. Can I convert a digital savings account into a regular account?\n\nYes. In most cases, once full KYC is completed, the account functions like a normal savings account. You can also visit a branch later if needed, depending on the bank’s model.",

        "full_content": "If you are a salaried employee, you may be used to checking your EPF balance from time to time, but are you also paying attention to your pension portion, the Employees’ Pension Scheme? Because that is usually where small mistakes can sit quietly for years.\n\nYour EPS is not money you can see easily or withdraw like your EPF, but under normal rules, 8.33 percent of your employer’s contribution goes into EPS and is subject to wage ceiling. This is money that also deserves your attention.\n\nThese errors can happen at the payroll level. Employers file the monthly returns and deposit the contributions. If salary details are entered incorrectly, if the wage ceiling is misapplied, or if your date of exit isn’t updated properly during a job switch, the EPS entry can go wrong.\n\nWhy this matters more than you think\n\nEPS is not just another number in your passbook. It determines your pension eligibility later. If you complete 10 years of contributory service, you become eligible for pension at 58 and you cannot withdraw that portion as a lump sum.\n\nIf your EPS records are inaccurate, it can affect how your service is calculated and how much pension you eventually receive. Fixing it early is far easier than trying to correct it 15 years later when you are close to retirement.\n\nCan you apply directly for a refund?\n\nThis is where most people get confused. As an employee, you cannot directly file an EPS refund claim with EPFO once you spot an error. Since the employer made the remittance, the employer has to ask for the correction.\n\nWhat happens to the excess amount?\n\nIf EPFO accepts that an error occurred, the excess EPS amount may either be refunded or adjusted. In some cases, the wrongly credited EPS portion can be shifted to your EPF account instead of being paid out separately. It depends on the nature of the mistake and the applicable rules.\n\nProcessing timelines vary. Some corrections are straightforward. Others take longer if documentation is incomplete or if there are multiple months involved.\n\nMost people only check their PF when they want to withdraw money. That’s risky. Your Universal Account Number links all your past jobs. If you switch employers frequently and don’t monitor your records, small mistakes can accumulate.\n\nEPS may feel distant because pension seems far away. But pension calculations depend entirely on what is recorded today.\n\n1. What kind of EPS errors are common?\n\nThe most common issues are excess contributions due to wrong wage calculation, duplicate entries, or contributions continuing after your exit date. These usually arise from payroll mistakes.\n\n2. Can excess EPS contribution affect my pension?\n\nYes. Pension eligibility and calculation are linked to recorded service and contribution data. Errors can distort your service record if not corrected.\n\n3. Is there a time limit to correct EPS mistakes?\n\nThere is no simple fixed deadline, but the longer you wait, the harder it becomes to trace payroll records and get employer cooperation. It is always better to address discrepancies as soon as you spot them.",

        "full_content": "Fractal Analytics is set to become India’s first artificial intelligence (AI) company to get listed on the bourses on February 16, pegged at a valuation of Rs 14,450 crores. This comes a day after the company reduced its initial public offering (IPO) size by 42 percent, and trimmed the top band of its share price by 18 percent.\n\nThe company’s listing date got a strategic push, getting aligned between Union Budget’s bullish announcements for the technology and AI services sector and India’s upcoming AI Impact Summit happening later in the month.\n\nFractal has fixed a price band of Rs 857 to Rs 900 per share. It has reduced its public issue size by 42 percent to Rs 2,834 crore in the RHP, compared to the Rs 4,900-crore IPO outlined in its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) last year.\n\nAccording to Srikanth Velamakanni, Co-founder and CEO, Fractal, the move came from the bankers and fund managers’ advise to leave “a lot of money on the table for making the IPO attractive for people to invest and see results.” The share price on the top end of the band was previously pegged at Rs 1,110 per share.\n\n“At that price band, our investors said they would want to hold on, and stay on with Fractal for much longer. As they didn’t want to sell much, we had to reduce the overall IPO size,” Velamakanni told Moneycontrol in an interview on the sidelines of Fractal’s IPO roadshow in Mumbai on February 4.\n\nHe added, “We have been trying to strike that balance between how low we can price versus the investors simply not willing to sell. So, finally we found this equilibrium.”\n\nAt present, Apax Partners-managed Quinag Bidco, TPG Fett Holdings, GLM Family Trust, and Satya Kumari Remala and Rao Venkateswara Remala will be the selling shareholders in the offer-for-sale.\n\nMeanwhile, Velamakanni and co-founder Pranay Agrawal will continue to hold on to their stakes post listing.\n\nAshwath Bhat, Chief Financial Officer, Fractal said, over the last three years, the company’s profitability has expanded well, recording Rs 220 crores of net income last fiscal year. While the adjusted EBITDA grew to 17.4 percent, compared to close to 10 percent a couple of years ago.\n\n“While our gross margin has stayed at around 45 to 46 percent, we are always focused on growth and our operating leverage takes care of the rest. Our drivers for future profitability will continue to be how we keep that gross margin high and improving and then SG&A by nature is either semi-variable or more or less fixed, so that is the operating method that will always be implemented,” he said.\n\nThe company is also steadily growing its research and development (R&D) spend as a part of the overall revenue. It grew from 5.2 percent of the revenue in the last fiscal year to 6.1 percent in the first half of this year, Bhat said.\n\n“We would like to keep taking it in line with the revenue growth and also keeping the margins growing,” he added.\n\nFor its global competitors such as Palantir Technologies, R&D spend has been as high as 12-16 percent of the revenue.\n\nEven as competition between AI companies continue to intensify in the US -- also Fractal’s core market contributing around 64-65 percent of its overall revenue -- Velamakanni remained bullish that focusing on enterprise AI use cases will help the company stay differentiated.\n\n“While so much exciting AI companies are coming, how many amazing enterprise AI companies have you heard of? Beyond Palantir, name one?” He asks.\n\n“Anthropic has been doing an amazing job. At least in some verticals, they are beginning to build some enterprise capabilities. Their enterprise API is already being accessed by a lot of firms, which is very good. Even that, by the way, is just a starting point. It's not the end point,” he said.\n\nHe added, “There are very few AI companies that are building enterprise AI significantly. They're all interested in the exciting consumer AI.

He further added that access to investments should be made available to every person, with the current mechanisms being complex to the average Joe.\n\n“The money in the stock market is compounding, and India has an efficient market. We have now regulated it well, and if we can channelise this money to grow, that is the opportunity that we have where hundreds of millions of Indians become owners of wealth,” Ambani said.\n\n“The target is to make sure you're living with purpose every day, with each and every client, and if you can achieve that with consistency, day after day, clients will reward you with more share of their wallet,” Ambani further said.\n\nIn the recent past, mutual funds and the equities market have increasingly turned out to be alternative savings instruments as people move away from bank deposits in search of higher returns.\n\nThe Jio-Blackrock joint venture was first announced in 2023, while the asset management company received final approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to operate as a mutual fund business in mid 2025. It now stands at the 15th position in the nearly 50-player mutual fund industry. Some of its mutual fund schemes utilise AI-driven insights as a model, with the involvement of an experienced fund manager.\n\nMoreover, BlackRock’s proprietary technology, the Aladdin platform, will also help in portfolio generation.

        "full_content": "You realise it a few minutes later. The email looked real. The website looked identical. You entered your password, maybe even your card details or an OTP. Then the doubt creeps in.\n\nIf you’ve fallen for a phishing attack, speed matters more than panic. The goal is simple: cut off the attacker’s access before they can use what you gave them.\n\nHere’s what to do immediately.\n\n1. Secure the compromised account first\n\nStart with the account you used on the fake site. If it was your email, bank account, UPI app or social media login, go directly to the official app or website — not through the suspicious link — and change your password immediately.\n\nCreate a completely new password. Not a variation of the old one. Not the same password with an extra number at the end. If you’ve reused that password elsewhere, change it on those accounts too. Password reuse is one of the main reasons phishing spreads from one account to many.\n\nIf the account offers the option, log out of all active sessions so that any attacker who may already be inside gets kicked out.\n\n2. Enable two-factor authentication everywhere\n\nIf you haven’t already turned on two-factor authentication, do it now. This adds a second layer of protection — typically a one-time code or authentication app approval — that makes it harder for someone to access your account even if they have your password.\n\nUse an authenticator app instead of SMS wherever possible. SIM swap fraud is increasingly common, and app-based authentication is safer.\n\n3. Contact your bank immediately\n\nIf you shared card details, net banking credentials, or a UPI PIN, call your bank’s official helpline and block the card or freeze the account. Do not wait to “see if anything happens.” Fraudsters often test small transactions before attempting larger withdrawals.\n\nIf money has already been debited in India, call 1930 (the national cybercrime helpline) immediately and file a complaint on the cybercrime portal. Faster reporting increases the chance of freezing the transaction.\n\nAlso check whether your bank allows you to temporarily disable online transactions. Many apps let you switch off international usage, ATM withdrawals or online payments instantly.\n\nIf you suspect your device itself has been compromised and you’re unsure what was installed, consider a professional reset after backing up essential data.\n\n5. Watch your accounts for the next few weeks\n\nPhishing damage doesn’t always show up instantly. Monitor bank statements, UPI history, credit card bills and email login alerts carefully for at least a month.\n\nIf attackers accessed your email, they may try to reset passwords for other services. Watch for “password reset” emails you didn’t initiate.\n\n6. Report the phishing attempt\n\nReporting the email or message helps others. Forward phishing emails to your email provider’s reporting address, mark WhatsApp or SMS messages as spam, and report fake websites to your bank or service provider.\n\nIt won’t undo what happened, but it reduces the chances of someone else falling into the same trap.\n\nPhishing works because it plays on urgency — “Your account will be blocked,” “Update immediately,” “Refund pending.” The fix is also urgency, but calm, deliberate urgency. Act fast, secure everything, and assume your information has been exposed even if nothing looks wrong yet.\n\nThe difference between a minor scare and a financial crisis often comes down to how quickly you respond.\n\n1. I shared my OTP. Is my money definitely gone?\n\nNot necessarily. OTP-based fraud often happens in minutes, but if you immediately contact your bank and block access, you may prevent larger losses. The key is speed — report it the moment you realise what happened.\n\n2. What if I only clicked the link but didn’t enter any details?\n\n3. Should I file a police complaint for phishing?\n\nIf money has been lost or sensitive identity documents were shared, yes. In India, you should call 1930 immediately and file a complaint on the national cybercrime portal. Early reporting significantly improves the chances of recovering funds or freezing fraudulent transfers.",

        "full_content": "In an era marked by elevated global uncertainty, India’s Union Budget 2026 stands out for what it resists as much as for what it delivers. While several major economies continue to rely on prolonged fiscal excess, unconventional policy tools, and uncertain trade postures, India has chosen a steadier course – anchored in realism, fiscal prudence, and calibrated prioritisation.\n\nAt its core, the Budget reinforces the government’s commitment to its medium-term fiscal consolidation path. This consistency is notable, particularly at a time when global macro conditions could have justified looser purse strings. Instead, policymakers have stayed the course, signalling confidence in India’s underlying growth dynamics and a preference for stability over headline-grabbing announcements.\n\nThat said, there is a discernible shift in the composition of fiscal support. In the post-pandemic years from FY21 to FY24, the central government ran an aggressive supply-side stimulus, led by infrastructure spending and public investment. Capital expenditure growth during this period averaged an impressive 31%, laying the foundation for medium-term productivity gains and crowding in private investment.\n\nFrom FY25 to FY27 (Budget Estimates), however, capex growth moderates to about 10% on average. While this marks a deceleration, it is important to recognise that spending remains elevated on a significantly higher base – effectively keeping the economy in fourth gear rather than accelerating further.\n\nMore importantly, the baton appears to be passing from supply-side stimulus to domestic consumption support. Revenue expenditure, which grew at an average of 4% between FY21 and FY24, has risen to around 7% in FY26 and FY27 (BE). This rebalancing suggests a conscious policy choice to bolster household demand, recognising its role as a stabilising force amid global volatility.\n\nFrom a bond market perspective, this prudence is not without near-term friction. Higher-than-expected gross borrowing could create some discomfort, even if the surprise is modest. The implication may be a marginal uptick in the cost of capital, an outcome the monetary authority may need to manage through liquidity operations, maturity adjustments in issuance, or other policy tools.\n\nOn the macro assumptions front, the FY27 Budget Estimates appear conservative. The implied improvement in nominal GDP growth to around 10% leaves room for upside surprises. In an uncertain global environment, such conservatism provides valuable flexibility – allowing potential gains to be redeployed, should growth outperform expectations.\n\nEquity markets, meanwhile, will need to digest selective measures. The increase in securities transaction tax on derivatives comes as a mild surprise, aimed at tempering excessive participation in the futures and options segment. Notably, there were no changes to long-term capital gains taxation, offering continuity for both domestic and foreign investors. Some easing of buyback norms could help mature companies return surplus capital, enabling its redeployment into newer, capital-intensive opportunities across the economy.\n\nOverall, the Budget is unlikely to materially alter the medium-term outlook for equities. Rather, it reinforces the view that the past 15 months have marked a reset – shaped by geopolitical shifts and global macro uncertainty. For investors, this is a reminder to look ahead with a fresh lens. Over the next three to four years, a new set of themes and sectors is likely to emerge as leaders, distinct from the investment-heavy winners of 2021–2024.\n\nSeasonally, the first quarter has often been challenging for Indian equities. If history rhymes, any near-term volatility could offer a constructive entry point for building portfolios aligned with India’s evolving growth narrative.",

        "full_content": "FMCG major Marico has acquired 60 percent in Cosmix, a startup that sells plant-based protein supplements, for Rs 225.67 crore, the companies announced in a joint statement on February 4.\n\nThe remaining 40 percent will be acquired over a three-year period. The deal effectively values the seven-year-old startup at around Rs 375 crore.\n\nMoneycontrol wasfirst to report Marico was in talks to acquire Cosmix on December 16.\n\nSaugata Gupta, MD and CEO, Marico Limited, said, “The investment in Cosmix brings\n\nanother strong and differentiated brand into our digital-first portfolio. We foresee immense\n\npotential in the wellness and plant‑based nutrition space, and Cosmix has already\n\ndemonstrated deep consumer resonance with its best-in-class, innovative offerings. Together,\n\nwe are committed to accelerating their journey, expanding into relevant adjacent wellness\n\ncategories, and building a sustainable, profitable brand that inspires trust and delivers\n\nmeaningful value to consumers across India.”\n\nA valuation of Rs 375 crore means the brand is valued at about 3.7X its current revenue. Bengaluru-based Cosmix clocked revenues of Rs 25 crore in FY24 and doubled it to Rs 50 crore in FY25. The company will double its top line again and likely close FY26 at around Rs 100 crore.\n\nThe Rainmaker Group (TRMG) was the exclusive advisor to Cosmix on the deal. Kashyap Parikh, Partner at TRMG said “it was one of the fastest M&A deals for TRMG.”\n\nA deal has been signed as an increasing number of Indians look to consume more protein as part of their daily meals to increase strength and build muscles and for general upkeep.\n\nCosmix, founded in 2019 by husband-wide duo Soorya Jagadish and Vibha Harish, was initially bootstrapped with a personal investment of Rs 20 lakh, Harish told Moneycontrol.\n\nAsked if the couple was happy with the outcome, and the valuations, Harish said: “There were other options on the table but conversations with Marico just clicked. We're very happy (with the valuation).”\n\nMilk brands like Amul, Milky Mist, Akshayakalpa and others have all introduced variants with a higher protein content to appeal to a wider base of consumers. Other brands like iD Fresh Food and Nandini have begun adding protein to dosa batter and other products as consumer demands increase.\n\nDuring a conference call with analysts in August, Saugata Gupta, Marico CEO and Managing Director, had also conceded protein is an important category. \"Now, coming to protein, you have to participate in the category,\" he said at that time.\n\nMarico, which has acquired at least four direct to consumer (D2C) brands in recent years, and has expressed willingness to acquire more brands and grow its digital-first portfolio.\n\n\" ... Foods is (of) interest (to) us, so therefore we will continue to be looking into these acquisitions. Our track record for acquisition has been good. We now have a good playbook. And we also believe that we see ourselves as a strategic investor of choice,\" CEO and MD Saugata Gupta had told analysts on August 4 last year.\n\nMarico has acquired and grown revenues of brands like Plix, True Elements, Beardo, Just Herbs and more, all of which create a network of digital-first brands that help in cross-selling.\n\nAll of these brands have scaled manifolds since they came under Marico's fold.\n\nMarico’s digital businesses, largely consisting of Plix, True Elements, Beardo, Just Herbs, cumulatively had revenues of Rs 900 crore as of Q1FY26, the company said while announcing its quarterly results in August.\n\nThe aspiration is to scale the top line to Rs 2,000-2,500 crore over the next three years, Marico said.\n\nAsked if the target would come organically or through acquisitions, CEO Gupta had told analysts that Marico \" ... will be happy to acquire some and ensure that this number is definitely achieved or crossed.\"\n\nMoneycontrol has previously reported on how D2C consolidation results in value creation for FMCG majors and wealth creation for founders, other stakeholders.\n\nALSO READ:D2C consolidation: Value creation for FMCG majors, wealth creation for founders"

        "full_content": "Most people assume that once they write someone’s name as a nominee in a bank account, mutual fund, insurance policy or provident fund, that person automatically becomes the owner of that money after their death.\n\nThe confusion comes from mixing up two different concepts: nominee and legal heir. They are not the same thing, and understanding the difference can prevent serious family disputes later.\n\nThe person you name as the nominee in your official documents is the custodian of your money. If something were to happen to you, this nominee would receive the money. But only as a custodian. Think of the nominee as a trustee who collects the amount and then distributes it according to succession laws or your will.\n\nBanks and institutions prefer you appoint a nominee because it means they can quicky release funds without waiting for succession certificates or court orders. It makes the administrative process simpler. But in many cases, the nominee does not automatically become the beneficial owner of that money. They receive it on behalf of the legal heirs.\n\nA legal heir is someone who is entitled to inherit your assets under the applicable succession law. This depends on your religion and personal law, unless you have left behind a valid will.\n\nIf you die without a will, your property and financial assets are distributed according to the succession rules that apply to you. Your spouse, children and parents usually fall in the first category of heirs under many personal laws.\n\nIn such a case, even if you named only one child as a nominee in your bank account, the other legal heirs may still have a rightful share in that money.\n\nMany people name one family member as nominee simply for convenience. For example, a husband may name his wife as nominee in all accounts. Or a parent may name the eldest child.\n\nLater, after the account holder’s death, other family members may claim their legal share. If there is no will, the nominee may be legally required to share the funds.\n\nThere are some exceptions. In certain financial instruments, like specific types of insurance policies, courts have in some cases treated nominees differently. But as a general rule, nomination does not override succession law.\n\nIf you have written a clear and valid will specifying who should receive what, your assets will be distributed according to that will, regardless of who the nominee is. In such cases, the nominee hands over the money to the person named in the will.\n\nIf there is no will, succession laws decide.\n\nThat is why nomination and estate planning should not be treated as the same thing. A nomination helps with smooth transfer. A will decides ownership.\n\nFirst, always update nominees in all financial accounts, especially after marriage, divorce or the birth of children.\n\nSecond, do not assume nomination is enough. If you want to clearly define who inherits your assets, write a proper will.\n\nNomination prevents delay. A will prevents conflict.\n\nThey serve different purposes. You need both.\n\n1. If I nominate my spouse, will my children have no claim?\n\nNot necessarily. If you die without a will, your children may still have a legal right to a share under succession law, even if your spouse is the nominee.\n\n2. Can a nominee refuse to share the money with other heirs?\n\nIf other legal heirs have a valid claim under the law and there is no will stating otherwise, the nominee may not be the final owner and may be legally required to distribute the money.\n\n3. Is nomination the same as writing a will?\n\nNo. Nomination only allows a person to receive the asset from the institution. A will determines who ultimately owns and inherits the asset.",

        "full_content": "India’s growing reliance on the US for defence imports, particularly in high-tech segments such as sensors, engines and missiles, highlights a quieter but important shift underway in New Delhi’s procurement strategy, a Moneycontrol analysis shows.\n\nThe recently announced India-US trade deal is expected to help Indian exporters claw back market share in the US, but it will also open India’s market wider to American goods. Defence is likely to be among the most consequential of these openings. The $500 billion trade and investment commitment embedded in the deal is expected to give a fresh boost to US arms exports to India, reinforcing a trend that has been building steadily over the past two decades.\n\nIn the late 2000s, India’s defence imports were overwhelmingly dominated by Russia. Between 2007 and 2012, Russia accounted for nearly four-fifths of India’s defence imports, while the US had only a marginal presence, with a share of just under 3 percent. That picture has since changed markedly. By the 2013–2018 period, the US share climbed to nearly 15 percent and although it has moderated slightly in the most recent phase, Washington still accounts for around 13 percent of India’s defence imports in 2019–2024. Over the same period, Russia’s share has fallen sharply to 36 percent, while France—boosted by Rafale aircraft deliveries—has emerged as another major supplier.\n\nThe shift is even more pronounced at the category level. In aircraft imports, the US share has risen from less than 4 percent in 2007-2012 to nearly 23 percent in 2019-2024. In engines, the US now accounts for over a quarter of India’s imports, up from about 11 percent in the late 2000s. American suppliers have also gained ground in missiles and advanced sensors, areas where technology access and interoperability matter as much as price.\n\nThis tilt towards US systems has been shaped by both strategic and political factors. US President Donald Trump has consistently pushed for higher defence exports, and India was a major beneficiary during his first term. In April 2019, Washington cleared the sale of 24 MH-60R Seahawk helicopters worth about $2.6 billion, followed in February 2020 by approval for the Integrated Air Defence Weapon System, estimated at $1.9 billion.\n\nCrucially, two of India’s four foundational defence agreements with the US—COMCASA and BECA—were also signed during the Trump years, significantly deepening interoperability and intelligence sharing. India was additionally elevated to Strategic Trade Authorisation-1 status, granting access to sensitive technologies previously reserved for close US allies.\n\nAs the India–US trade relationship deepens further, defence imports are likely to remain a key channel through which trade balances adjust.",

In return, a set of US goods is expected to receive zero-duty or sharply reduced-duty access to India. While the immediate focus has been on the export boost for India, the more subtle impact lies in how the deal alters competition within India’s import basket.\n\nThat impact is most pronounced for countries whose export profiles to India closely overlap with those of the United States. The UK and Japan fall squarely into this category, with over 40 percent of their exports to India lying in segments where American suppliers are strong and could gain from improved market access.\n\nJapan’s exposure is particularly acute in capital goods, auto components, industrial machinery and electronics—sectors where tariff differentials can influence sourcing decisions. The UK faces similar risks, with overlap concentrated in industrial goods, chemicals, select engineering products and consumer categories.\n\nJapan has had a bilateral trade agreement with India for over a decade, while UK signed a trade deal last year. EU's trade deal was announced in January.\n\nChina, by contrast, appears far more insulated despite being India’s largest goods supplier. Much of China’s export basket to India is concentrated in categories driven by scale, supply-chain depth and ecosystem advantages rather than tariff competitiveness alone. As a result, only about 2 percent of Chinese exports to India are likely to face direct competition from US producers, largely confined to medical equipment.\n\nThe European Union, which has also concluded a trade agreement with India, is expected to see competitive pressure in a narrower set of categories. About 8.2 percent of EU exports to India fall in segments where US goods could become more competitive following the tariff reset.",

        "full_content": "Nearly $2.6 billion worth of South Asian exports to the United States could come under pressure once the India–US trade deal comes into force, as Indian exporters gain a decisive tariff advantage over regional peers, aMoneycontrolanalysis shows.\n\nPakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh together risk losing competitiveness in over a tenth of their exports to the US in product categories where India is either already exporting at least 20 percent more, or where the gap between Indian exports and those of its neighbours is within 30 percent.\n\nThe shift follows the announcement by US President Donald Trump on February 2 of a trade agreement with India that cut reciprocal tariffs to 18 percent from the earlier 50 percent. The deal significantly alters India’s relative standing in the US market, placing it below most South Asian—and several Southeast Asian—economies in terms of tariff burden.\n\nWhile the headline tariff rate for Indian goods now stands at 18 percent, competitiveness is shaped more by the trade-weighted average tariff across export categories. After the deal, India’s effective tariff falls to 10.7 percent, well below Bangladesh’s 19.9 percent, Sri Lanka’s 19.1 percent and Pakistan’s 18.2 percent. Indonesia’s trade-weighted rate is estimated at 16 percent, while Vietnam faces 12.5 percent. India’s tariff level is now broadly comparable with Thailand at 10.6 percent and the Philippines at 10.5 percent, and comfortably lower than most of its South Asian rivals.\n\nThis differential helps explain why South Asian economies are likely to feel the impact more sharply than exporters in Southeast Asia. Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan compete most directly with India in labour-intensive sectors, where margins are thin, buyers re-tender frequently, and even small tariff wedges can lead to shifts in sourcing.\n\nBased on current trade patterns, the combined value of exports from the three countries that could come under pressure is close to $2.6 billion. Bangladesh is particularly exposed in garments and home textiles, while Pakistan faces risks in bed linen and cotton-based products. Sri Lanka’s vulnerability lies in apparel and rubber-based goods, where India has been steadily expanding capacity and scale.\n\nThe deal also reshapes the broader competitive landscape in the US market. Southeast Asian exporters such as Vietnam and Thailand, though still facing higher tariffs than India, are partly cushioned by more diversified export baskets and deeper integration into electronics and machinery supply chains. South Asian economies, by contrast, remain heavily concentrated in labour-intensive segments where India’s scale, tariff advantage and improving logistics could more quickly displace rivals.\n\nAs US importers reassess sourcing strategies in the coming months, the tariff reset is likely to reinforce India’s position as the preferred South Asian supplier—leaving neighbouring exporters facing a tougher battle to defend market share.",

        "full_content": "The unveiling of the Union Budget for 2027 by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has set off an immediate stir in the financial markets. Indian equity markets responded with caution, as benchmark indices declined by around 2 percent during the special trading session held on Sunday. One of the key reasons for the sharp correction has been a significant increase in security transaction taxes (STT) on futures and options. Apart from the increase in STT, markets appeared underwhelmed by the absence of any major growth-stimulating announcements.\n\nThat said, while the Budget was largely predictable and did not offer immediate excitement for investors, predictability itself is a positive from a long-term perspective. The recent sell-off has been more sentiment-driven, with concerns surrounding near-term FII selling this week. At its core, the changes in STT have no impact on the fundamental value of the underlying securities. The fundamental value of any company is driven by its operating metrics and profitability. The increase or decrease in STT on futures and options has no significant bearing on the fundamental value of the company’s share price. Thus, the correction led by changes in STT is likely to be short-lived on the broader market, and the panic selling could provide a good opportunity.\n\nNow coming to the fundamentals of the Budget FY2027, clearly, it is a well-balanced budget with a focus on capex spending and maintaining the GDP growth trajectory. FY2026 has been a stable year as far as the GDP growth rate is concerned, and corporate earnings are picking up. The banking sector is in a very healthy position and generates a significant amount of cash profits, which will be ploughed back to generate a strong internal growth rate.\n\nThe top 500 companies rolling 4 quarters' profits have crossed Rs 16 lakh crore, which was around Rs 5 lakh crore in the pre-COVID era. This clearly indicates the underlying strength and provides solid fundamental groundwork for consistent earnings growth over the next decade.\n\nFiscal deficit for FY2026 at 4.4% and for FY2027 at 4.3% provide for a sound framework to bring down the debt-to-GDP ratio to under 50% by 2031. Apart from these factors, the capex push from the government remains consistent and in line with the nominal GDP growth rate, providing long-term multipliers for the economy. All these factors clearly point towards the economy growing at its trend line ~7%, which is solid in the global arena.\n\nIt is also important to note that the government’s assumptions of tax collections, nominal GDP growth rate, and divestment targets are conservative, which has pushed gross borrowing estimates a little higher, leading to rising bond yields. However, these challenges are likely to be short-lived as the core economic fundamentals are quite resilient and growth is likely to be very consistent.\n\nOverall, the budget is in line with expectations and is positive. The near-term challenges of changes in tax structure on certain financial instruments do not have any significant impact on the economy or the underlying value of the securities. These factors will be resolved soon, and markets will see new highs in 2026, rising in line with earnings growth. If some of the global headwinds recede, we could see an even stronger stock market in 2026 and FY2027.",

        "full_content": "At some point, almost everyone with one credit card gets tempted to apply for a second. Maybe it offers better cashback. Maybe it has airport lounge access. Maybe the bank calls and says you’re “pre-approved.”\n\nBut is it really smart to have multiple credit cards? The honest answer is: it depends on how organised you are.\n\nThe advantages of having more than one card\n\nThe biggest point in favour of having multiple credit cards is the flexibility they offer. One card may offer better cashback on groceries and fuel, another may give you more benefits on your travel bookings, while a premium card might offer you lounge access at airports, reward points or hotel discounts. If you spend across categories, using the right card strategically can improve overall rewards.\n\nThere’s also a credit score angle. When you have more than one card, your total credit limit increases. If you keep your spending low compared to your total available limit, your credit utilisation ratio improves. For example, spending Rs 50,000 on a single card with a Rs 1 lakh limit means 50 percent utilisation. The same Rs 50,000 spread across cards with a combined Rs 5 lakh limit means just 10 percent utilisation. Lower utilisation usually helps your credit score.\n\nAnother practical benefit is backup. If one card is blocked due to fraud or a technical issue, you’re not stranded.\n\nThe risks you shouldn’t ignore\n\nThe downside is behavioural, not technical.\n\nMultiple cards make it easier to overspend. Swiping feels painless, especially when the due dates are different. If you are not tracking your total monthly outgo, you may only realise the problem when bills pile up.\n\nAnother issue is annual fees. Premium cards often come with yearly charges. If you’re holding multiple fee-based cards and not extracting value from their benefits, you’re simply paying for plastic.\n\nMissed payments are another danger. Forgetting one due date can hurt your credit score significantly. Even a single EMI bounce or delayed card payment can stay on your credit report for years.\n\nThere’s also the temptation of converting purchases into easy EMIs. If several cards are running parallel EMIs, your cash flow can quietly tighten.\n\nWhat credit experts usually advise\n\nMost financial planners will tell you that one to three well-chosen credit cards are more than enough for most salaried individuals.\n\nIf you are disciplined, pay your full bill on time every month and understand reward structures, two or three cards can work efficiently. One primary spending card, one backup or category-focused card, and possibly one travel card if you genuinely travel often.\n\nBut if you are someone who struggles with budgeting or tends to revolve credit, even one card can be risky.\n\nExperts also recommend setting up auto debit for full payment, not just the minimum due. Paying the minimum keeps the account active but allows interest to compound at very high rates.\n\nFinally, your number of cards should match your income stability. If your cash flow fluctuates, simplicity is safer.\n\nSo, should you have multiple credit cards?\n\nMultiple cards are not inherently good or bad. They are tools.\n\nIf you are organised, track spending monthly and clear dues fully, having more than one card can improve rewards and strengthen your credit profile.\n\nIf you are already juggling EMIs, carrying balances or feeling financially stretched, adding another card is not the solution.\n\nThe real question is not how many cards you have. It’s whether you control them, or they control you.",

However, this exemption excludes unit holders who bought the bonds on stock exchanges, even if they hold them until maturity or exit early after five years. The Budget 2026 has revoked a significant exemption affecting secondary market buyers.\n\nInvestors who subscribed to the 2019–20 Series IV (issue date: September 17, 2019), the 2019–20 Series X (issued on March 11, 2020), the 2020–21 Series VI (issued on September 8, 2020), and the 2020–21 Series XII (issued on March 9, 2021) have been informed that the RBI has intimated the details of SGBs falling due for premature redemption during the second half of 2025–26, up to March 2026, along with the timelines for submitting premature redemption requests. Investors must give notice to their bank at least 30 days in advance.\n\nInvestors holding bonds of these specific series should notify their bank or depository at least one month prior to the maturity date.\n\nHarsh Roongta, Founder of Fee Only Investment Advisers LLP, said, \"Unfortunately, the virtual retrospective amendment to the SGB exemption rules means that only 4 out of the 28 SGB series qualify for the exemption, as only these four have early redemption windows falling between now and March 31. Investors who purchased these four series from the secondary market, therefore, still have a chance to claim the tax exemption.\"\n\nThe Budget 2026 amendment has impacted investors who bought SGBs in the secondary market and redeemed them at maturity. The maturity proceeds will now be taxed starting April 1, even though they were previously largely exempt. Therefore, if someone wants to redeem them now, they can do so to lower their tax liability. The core purpose of the budget amendment is to tax redemptions made after April 1, 2026, for purchases made in the secondary market.\n\nEchoing similar views, Harshvardhan Roongta, CFP, CTEP, Roongta Securities says, “Only those SGB tranches that are completing five years and have a premature redemption window open before March 31 are eligible to redeem.\"\n\nRoongta said that investors can submit their applications during the specified window for each series. As of now, capital gains on these redemptions remain tax-free, since the revised taxation rules apply only from April 1. This eligibility also extends to investors who bought SGBs from the secondary market, as long as the bonds have completed five years and are due for premature redemption.\n\n\"No separate intimation is required in such cases, as the investor is already reflected as the unit holder in RBI records. At present, only four SGB series are eligible under the February–March redemption window,” he added.",

        "full_content": "The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) could not have asked for a calmer backdrop. As it begins deliberations today, three big variables that usually pull policy in different directions are, for once, broadly aligned.\n\nThe Union Budget has offered fiscal clarity, the US–India trade deal has eased external anxieties, and banks are reporting early signs of life in industrial credit. In such moments, central banks tend to choose patience over provocation.\n\nStart with the Budget. The government has resisted the temptation to loosen the purse strings and stayed committed to a gradual consolidation path even as it continues to push public capital expenditure.\n\nThere were no nasty surprises on borrowing and no signal that fiscal policy will crowd out private investment. For the RBI, that removes a familiar headache. Stable government finances reduce upward pressure on yields and allow monetary policy to focus on growth and inflation rather than firefighting in the bond market.\n\nThe external backdrop has also turned friendlier. The US–India trade agreement may not transform trade flows overnight, but it has reduced a layer of uncertainty at a time when global commerce remains fragile. Markets have taken comfort from the deal, the rupee has steadied, and fears of sudden capital flow reversals have receded. For the MPC, this matters. When the external environment looks less volatile, there is less need to use interest rates as a defensive tool. Readthis pieceby Aparna Iyer andthisby Vivek Kelkar for more context on this deal.\n\nPerhaps the most important shift, though, is playing out within the banking system. After years of credit growth being dominated by retailloans,demand from industry is showing signs of revival. Manufacturing, infrastructure-linked sectors and large corporates are once again approaching banks with expansion plans.\n\nThis revival is still tentative and far from uniform, but it is meaningful enough to change the policy calculus. Monetary easing is most effective when credit demand is weak. When it is already picking up, the risk is that aggressive rate cuts end up distorting pricing rather than supporting productive investment.\n\nAll this points to a familiar and comfortable outcome for the RBI -- a pause on policy rates. Inflation is not forcing the MPC’s hand, growth has momentum, and financial conditions are already accommodative in practice, thanks largely to the central bank’s liquidity management. There is little to be gained from tweaking the repo rate at this juncture.\n\nThat does not mean this will be a quiet meeting. Liquidity remains the pressure point. Credit growth continues to outpace deposit mobilisation, tightening conditions for banks and threatening to blunt transmission. This is where the RBI is likely to stay active. Open market operations, fine-tuned repo auctions and other liquidity tools will remain central to its playbook. The message will be clear: The RBI is willing to do the heavy lifting on liquidity while keeping rates steady.\n\nThe language of the policy statement will also matter. The MPC will want to acknowledge the positives without sounding triumphant. Inflation risks have not vanished, global financial markets remain prone to sudden mood swings, and the durability of the industrial credit revival is yet to be tested. By keeping its stance flexible and its options open, the RBI preserves credibility.\n\nIn the end, this is an MPC meeting defined less by what it might announce and more by what it chooses not to do. Sometimes, for a central bank, the smartest move is to step back and let the cycle breathe.\n\nInvesting insights from our research team\n\nNTPC’s earnings hold firm as green capex accelerates\n\nAditya Birla Lifestyle Brands: Can it sustain the growth momentum?\n\nCan this old music catalogue company still drive growth?\n\nVarun Beverages: Steady growth, but margins dip amid rising competition\n\nGabriel India Q3 FY26: Strong execution; growth potential priced in\n\nBajaj Finance Q3 FY26 profit drops on accelerated provisioning despite benign asset quality\n\nPower Grid: Charged to tap emerging T&D opportunities\n\nPro Economic Tracker | Auto sales marginally higher, consumer sentiment improves\n\nDoes the market rally signal premature optimism?\n\nUS-India trade deal may ease RBI’s trilemma, but not its policy rate\n\nChart of the Day | After the rebound, what will drive rupee’s next move?\n\nLower US tariffs, EU market access: Double bonanza for Indian auto parts makers\n\nTariffs, oil and leverage: India's calculated play in the US trade talks\n\nUS trade deal all set to remove growth roadblocks for solar panel makers\n\nCredit finds its feet even as rates stay firm\n\nMartin Wolf: Reading the runes on a Warsh Fed(republished from the FT)\n\nUS trade deal cements case for monetary pause\n\nIndia-US trade deal is costly but much-needed\n\nIndia-US deal's a great start, but follow-up on the day after is critical\n\nIndia-US trade deal represents a macro-positive development\n\nIndia-US trade deal may help sentiment, but it is unlikely to create immediate earnings impact: Axis MF's Ashish Gupta\n\nTechnical Picks:BHARTIARTL, NMDC, DIXON, ONGC, HEROMOTOCO",

        "full_content": "Even as gold prices hover at record highs, state-owned Bank of Baroda (BoB) is comfortable about its gold loan portfolio’s growth and may recalibrate, if volatility persists, manging director and chief executive officer Debadatta Chand toldMoneycontrolin an interview.\n\nHe noted that while retail goldloanshave seen sharp growth in percentage terms, the overall exposure is still relatively small in absolute numbers, limiting balance-sheet risk.\n\nChand added that in the agri gold loan segment, the bank follows a calibrated approach by maintaining conservative loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and making margin adjustments to cushion against price volatility.\n\nDespite higher net profit, why has operating profit declined this quarter?\n\nOperating profit is a function of core income and expenditure, and this quarter reflects a completely normalised performance without any one-offs, positive or negative. Net interest income (NII) has remained largely stable, which means operating profit hasn’t expanded materially and shows a marginal dip.\n\nHowever, net profit is higher primarily due to lower provisioning. Last quarter, the bank created floating provisions and saw elevated standard asset provisioning due to regulatory COD related requirements. This quarter, those factors were absent, leading to lower provisions and higher net profit. Importantly, every line item, from income to expenditure, fully reflects core operations, underscoring the sustainability of earnings.\n\nIs this the highest-ever quarterly profit for the bank?\n\nNo, the bank has reported higher quarterly profits in the past, largely driven by one-off factors. However, on a normalised basis, this is among the strongest quarters. The bank has now delivered profits exceeding Rs 4,000 crore for 12 consecutive quarters, and profits above Rs 5,000 crore in three of the last six quarters. This quarter’s profit of Rs 5,035 crore demonstrates the underlying earning potential of the balance sheet.\n\nTreasury income rose 15.4% QoQ, with exchange transaction profits up nearly 48%. How sustainable is this trend?\n\nTreasury income for the quarter stood at Rs 1,080 crore, broadly in line with Q2 levels. While it is higher than in Q3 FY25 (Rs 936 crore), treasury performance remains market-dependent. On a normalised basis, quarterly treasury income typically ranges between Rs 900–1,000 crore.\n\nExchange transaction gains were driven by higher currency volatility and opportunities in the swap market. However, this was partly offset by depreciation provisions, which were absent last quarter. Overall, net treasury performance remains broadly stable.\n\nIf rupee volatility persists, can exchange transaction profits rise further?\n\nTreasury operations are governed by strict risk limits due to the inherently volatile nature of currency markets. While volatility can create trading opportunities, profitability is capped by predefined risk tolerance thresholds. Therefore, even in a volatile environment, exchange transaction profits are unlikely to increase significantly beyond current levels.\n\nHow much ECL (expand) provisioning was done this quarter, and what should we expect ahead?\n\nECL guidelines are still in draft form. No additional ECL or floating provisions were created this quarter. However, the bank already holds around Rs 1,000 crore in floating provisions as a buffer for eventual ECL implementation. Last quarter, an additional Rs 400 crore floating provision was created.\n\nOn implementation, the one-time impact on CRAR (Capital to Risk (Weighted) Assets Ratio)is estimated at ~60 bps (net of potential reversals), amortisable over five years. On a recurring basis, ECL could add ~18 bps to credit costs.\n\nDomestic CASA ratio declined by 88 bps QoQ. What is the bank’s comfort level?\n\nThe CASA ratio currently stands at 38.45 percent, which places the bank in the top quartile among large peers. While CASA ratios across the industry are under pressure due to faster loan growth relative to deposits, the bank’s decline has been relatively modest. There is no specific CASA target; the ratio will evolve based on the balance between loan and deposit growth.\n\nWhat steps are the bank taking to strengthen CASA?\n\nThe bank is focusing on launching new savings products and bundled offerings, enhancing service quality and digital engagement, expanding salary account acquisition through bulk retail tie-ups, and leveraging brand campaigns and partnerships.\n\nWhile savings deposit growth has remained above the industry median over the last three years, structural shifts, such as customer preference for capital markets, continue to weigh on CASA growth.\n\nWith gold prices at record highs, will the bank be cautious on gold loan growth?\n\nGold price volatility is closely monitored. While retail gold loans have grown sharply in percentage terms, the absolute exposure remains relatively small. In agri gold loans, growth is calibrated using conservative loan-to-value ratios and margin adjustments to mitigate price risks. Currently, the bank is comfortable with growth but will recalibrate pace if volatility increases materially.\n\nRAM loans now account for 62% of domestic credit. What is the target mix?\n\nRAM loans grew 17.5 percent YoY, while corporate loans grew 8 percent. For FY26, corporate growth is expected at 10 percent, while RAM growth is likely to remain around 17–18 percent. Over the medium term (around three years), the bank aims to move toward a 65:35 RAM-to-corporate mix.\n\nWhat is the recovery outlook for FY26 and Q4?\n\nThe bank has set a principal recovery target of Rs 10,000 crore for the full year. Additionally, recoveries routed through income typically contribute Rs 700–750 crore per quarter. Q3 recoveries stood at Rs 812 crore, and a similar run-rate is expected in Q4.\n\nMSME NPAs and slippages remain elevated. Will the bank slow growth in this segment?\n\nNo. MSME remains a key growth focus. MSME credit grew 15.4 percent, with slippages broadly in line with portfolio characteristics. The bank emphasises cash-flow-based lending, participation in government-backed schemes, and CGTMSE-covered exposures. Management remains bullish on MSMEs and sees no reason to scale back growth in this segment.",

        "full_content": "If Rs 5 lakh has landed in your account, the first thing to decide is not the product. It’s the purpose. Are you using this money next year? In three years for a car or home renovation? In five years for a child’s education goal? Or is this long-term wealth building money you truly won’t touch for a decade?\n\nYour time frame changes your strategy completely. Let’s walk through it calmly.\n\nIf you need the money in 1 year\n\nWhen your horizon is one year, your job is not to maximise returns. It is to avoid regret.\n\nEquity is unpredictable in the short term. A market correction at the wrong time can wipe out gains. So this money should sit in low risk instruments such as a one year fixed deposit, treasury bills or a liquid or ultra short term debt fund.\n\nA bank fixed deposit offers certainty. The rate may not look exciting, but peace of mind has value. Remember that FD interest is taxed at your slab rate, so if you fall in the 30 percent bracket, your effective return drops significantly after tax.\n\nDebt mutual funds, depending on structure and holding period, may offer slightly better post tax efficiency, but recent tax rules have made many of them slab taxed as well. So compare net returns, not headline numbers.\n\nAt one year, capital protection is the win.\n\nThree years gives you room to improve returns slightly, but still not enough to go fully aggressive.\n\nHere, a balanced allocation works well. You might keep part of the money in short duration debt funds and part in conservative hybrid mutual funds. Hybrid funds include some equity exposure, which adds growth potential, but they are not as volatile as pure equity funds.\n\nOver three years, this blend can smooth out fluctuations. The key is not to expect equity like returns. Instead, think of improving upon fixed deposit returns while managing risk carefully.\n\nTax wise, if you hold equity-oriented hybrid funds for more than a year, you benefit from long term capital gains taxation, which may be more efficient than annual FD taxation.\n\nIf you can stay invested for 5 years\n\nFive years is where equity begins to make real sense.\n\nMarkets move in cycles. Over shorter periods, returns can disappoint. Over five years, the probability of positive outcomes increases meaningfully, though there are still no guarantees.\n\nYou can consider diversified equity mutual funds such as flexi cap funds or index funds. If you also want to save tax under Section 80C, ELSS funds are an option. They come with a three-year lock in but offer equity taxation benefits.\n\nAt this stage, the idea is growth with discipline. Don’t put the entire ₹5 lakh in one single theme or sector. Diversification reduces the emotional stress of volatility.\n\nFrom a tax perspective, equity gains held over one year qualify for long term capital gains treatment, which is generally more efficient than fixed deposit interest that is taxed yearly.\n\nTen years allows compounding to work properly.\n\nHere, you can allocate predominantly to equity if your risk tolerance allows. A combination of a broad-based index fund and a well-managed flexi cap fund can form a simple core portfolio.\n\nOver a decade, even a few percentage points of extra annual return can create a large difference in final corpus. For example, 7 percent and 12 percent returns look similar in one year. Over ten years, the gap becomes dramatic.\n\nBut long-term investing only works if you stay invested during downturns. The biggest risk is not the market. It is panic selling.\n\nOne year money should protect. Three year money should balance. Five year money should grow steadily. Ten year money should compound.\n\nAlso ask yourself one more question. Is this your emergency fund? If yes, keep it liquid and safe regardless of time horizon.\n\nMaximising returns and saving tax are important. But aligning the investment with your time frame and emotional comfort is what truly determines whether the plan succeeds.",

On the other hand, auto, energy, consumer durables, PSU, realty, metal, oil & gas and power advanced 1–2 percent.\n\nAlso Read -AI concerns wipe out nearly Rs 2 lakh crore m-cap from top IT stocks\n\nIn stock specific, Emami share price jumped 2.5% after strong Q3 earnings, Pidilite Industries share price rose 2.5% on better Q3 earnings, Sheela Foam shares surged 14% on strong Q3 earnings, NBCC India share price rose 3.5% on winning multiple orders, Yes Bank share price added 1% on RBI nod to appoint MD & CEO, Angel One shares gained 3.5% after better January numbers, Axiscades Technologies share price rose 5% after arm bags contract of USD 1.4 million, Sigachi Industries shares surged 15% after MD, CEO gets bail, Capacite Infraprojects shares rose 8% on winning order worth Rs 445 crore.\n\nAlso Read -IT stocks fall up to 8%: How big a threat is Anthropic's AI tool for Indian IT firms?

Nifty opened on a weak note on the backdrop of selling pressure in IT sector and recovered smartly from the lows of 25563 levels. It later moved into a range bound action with positive bias for the mid to later part of the session.\n\nA small bullish candle has been formed on the daily chart with minor upper and lower shadow. The said market action indicates a breather type pattern in the market after a massive upmove of Tuesday. The huge opening upside gap of Tuesday remains intact with partially filled.\n\nThe underlying short-term trend of the Nifty continues to be positive. The next upside hurdles to be watched around 26000 and next 26350 levels in the near term. Immediate support is placed at 25600.\n\nAjit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking\n\nMarkets traded range-bound on Wednesday as investors assessed follow-through activity after Tuesday’s strong rally triggered by the India–US trade deal. After a flat start, the Nifty oscillated within a narrow band through the session and ended marginally higher at 25,779.5. Sectoral trends were mixed, with buying interest visible in auto, metal and energy stocks, while the IT index declined sharply and underperformed the broader market. Market breadth remained firmly positive, supported by a sustained rebound in midcap and smallcap stocks.\n\nSentiment stayed cautious amid mixed global cues and some profit booking following the recent relief rally. Weakness in global technology stocks weighed on domestic IT counters, leading to sectoral divergence. At the same time, optimism surrounding the India–US trade agreement and expectations of improved foreign participation continued to support cyclical stocks and select heavyweight names.\n\nAfter the recent sharp swings, some consolidation would be healthy as long as the Nifty holds the 25,400–25,500 zone. On the upside, the index may attempt a move towards the 26,000 level, followed by a gradual push towards record highs. Among key sectors, banking, energy, metal and auto continue to show resilience, while pharma, FMCG and IT remain relatively subdued. Participants should align positions accordingly, with an emphasis on stock selection and disciplined trade management.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Total cost for the AP project may be revised upward to Rs1,100– 1,200bn from Rs960bn, due to rupee depreciation. The AP refinery will be housed under a separate entity, with BPCL exploring a strategic partnership, including discussions with foreign partners; Oil India has already signed a nonbinding MoU for participation in the project. BPCL’s cumulative capex over the next 5 years is guided at Rs2,500–2,700bn. Annual capex is expected to be Rs200-250bn over the initial 2 years, ramping up to Rs500-600bn p.a. over the subsequent 3 years. Further, BPCL continues to source non-sanctioned Russian crude, in the absence of any formal communication from the ministry.

        "full_content": "State-run Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) is open to sourcing crude from any country, including Venezuela, as long as it is commercially viable and available, Sanjay Khanna, director (refineries) with additional charge of chairman and managing director, toldMoneycontrolin an interview.\n\nAnnouncing the India-US trade deal on February 2, American President Donald Trump claimed that India has agreed to stop buying Russian oil. A few days earlier, he also said India would buy Venezuelan oil. The government is yet to respond to Trump’s claims.\n\nKhanna said to improve crude sourcing from global spot markets, the company is setting up a trading desk in Singapore. He also talked about Russian imports, Andhra Pradesh refinery and more. Edited excerpts of the interview:\n\nHow does BPCL plan to navigate the current geopolitical situation? Do you see an increase in imports of Venezuelan crude amid a potential stabilisation of the country’s oil sector?\n\nVenezuela crude has high residue, bottom material, metal content is more, which is the poison for the catalyst, and the nitrogen content is high, which is the impurity for my downstream. All the few things make it a little bit restrictive but having said that, suppose there's a techno-commercial viability and availability, then we will definitely look for it and my Bina and Kochi refinery can process up to 15 percent as a co-blend crude. When it comes to crude strategy, procurement strategy, our strategy, for that matter, is very simple, look for the crude which is giving the maximum value, and it is available at that point of time.\n\nDepending upon the product pattern requirement, we purchase a crude and we purchase from different geographies. That is the reason that whether there is Russian (crude) availability or non-availability, you will not see that any refinery’s throughput has been reduced. It is because we are buying from multiple sources at any point of time and it is getting arranged.\n\nAnd our 50 percent crude typically is term contract and 50 percent is a spot purchase. So that is our general philosophy. And I think it is doing great. The final testimony is that our GRM (gross refining margin) is the highest. Our international trade team is doing a fantastic job of getting the crude, LNG and LPG at very competitive prices.\n\nSo, will you be open to source Venezuelan crude?\n\nAbsolutely. Not only Venezuela, any crude comes because as a part of the business plan, it is a very standard thing for BPCL. We give target to every refinery to run trial tests with five different grades of crude.\n\nDo you see reducing reliance on Russian crude as a strategy?\n\nActually, this is the one point which is very dynamic in nature. Every second or third day, you know, changes are happening. So at this juncture, within the policy framework, whatever within the non-sanction limit is permitted, we will go for. But I will say that the number has shrunk to a very, very great extent at this time. But it doesn't make too much of a difference because I'm having the other alternative available to me and which is what I put to use at last.\n\nCome what may, at the end of the day, your throughput has not been impacted. You made the highest GRM. Our equal focus is there on operation excellence, energy reduction, and those types of variations are taken care of by market influencers, which are not in our control so that we can take care by these initiatives.\n\nWhat is the latest update on your Andhra refinery project?\n\nFor the Andhra refinery, close to 1,000-acre land acquisition has happened and we have to acquire 6,000 acre and I must compliment the state administration the way they are helping us to acquire the land. And they are pretty confident that by March we will have the required land.\n\nSecondly, the configuration for the refinery has been finalised and the environment clearance hearing has happened. If everything falls in place, we are expecting environment clearance to come by next month.\n\nThirdly, we are working on the detailed feasibility report of the refinery with approximately 35 percent of the petrochemical intensity index. That also is likely to be over by March. So you can say around March or April we will be having the final investment decision.\n\nWe are talking to many people and many have shown interest. It has the prospect of being a coastal refinery and it is shaping as a petrochemical unit which is futuristic in nature. This all makes it quite an attractive proposition and many people have shown interest.\n\nWhat is the update on your Mozambique and Brazil upstream projects? What will be the company’s exploration and production (E&P) strategy?\n\nOur Mozambique discovery, the mega discovery of gas, was under theforce majeurefrom April 2021. In November 2025, theforce majeurewas lifted and I am told that more than 5000 people are working on the project site, which is the indication that over 45 percent of progress has happened.\n\nRegarding our Brazil project, there also one of the requirements was that FPSO (Floating Production, Storage and Offloading unit), which has been awarded, and the final negotiation is in progress. So in 2028-29, we will get it completed and start receiving the material from these two projects (LNG from Mozambique and oil from Brazil).\n\nThe company has also announced significant oil discoveries in Abu Dhabi along with IOCL. What is the roadmap to develop these assets?\n\nEarly indications are saying it's a mega discovery, but being unconventional in nature, right now, other further technical things are being worked out at the juncture.\n\nHow does BPCL plan to deepen its international crude sourcing and engagement with global spot markets?\n\nWe are looking for every possible geography. We only see two aspects: techno-commercial, viability and availability. And now to take the whole thing to the very next level, we are setting up a trading desk at Singapore and that will give us much closer contact especially to the spot buyer. Today, I'm reaching out to people and there's definitely a time lag. The trading desk at Singapore, the whole team of international trade will be sitting there and they'll be trading from there and they'll be looking for the huge opportunity there.\n\nWe have got all the permission and maybe next month, the team will be located physically and they will start working and operating from Singapore.\n\nTo begin with the key role of the desk would be price discovery to fulfil our own requirement but in the long run, we are looking to do trading across the globe.\n\nWhat are your investment targets for FY26 and FY27?\n\nThis year, our all-time high investment is targeted for Rs 20,000 crore. And as of December, we have already incurred over Rs 10,000 crore and we are pretty confident we'll be crossing the limit.\n\nSo, our petrochemical projects are shaping up very well at both Bina and Kochi. Our gas project, other infra projects also are coming up.\n\nFor FY27, it (investment) will be much more. Next year, if anything happens with the Andhra Pradesh refinery, if it gets up, our capex would go up.",

        "full_content": "IT stocks had a rough day on the markets, and many investors felt the impact straight in their mutual fund portfolios. With big names like Infosys and TCS falling sharply and the Nifty IT index sliding over 6 percent in a single session, this move is no longer just a market headline, it’s a reality for retail investors with exposure to tech funds.\n\nOver the past few years, tech and IT funds gained popularity on the back of digital transformation and AI optimism. But this sharp selloff has reminded investors that thematic bets can turn volatile very quickly.\n\nToday’s fall isn’t about weak earnings or a global slowdown. Markets are reacting to fears that rapid AI advances could disrupt traditional IT business models at a time when valuations were already stretched. Since most tech mutual funds are heavily invested in a few large IT stocks, such sharp sector-wide falls quickly show up as NAV losses, with limited downside protection.\n\nSo after this sudden selloff, what should investors do now?\n\nIf tech funds form a small part of your portfolio\n\nFor investors where technology funds account for less than 10 percent of total equity exposure, experts say there is little reason to react emotionally.\n\n“If tech exposure is under 10 percent, investors should treat this fall as a sectoral cycle and stay invested,” says Kirang Gandhi, Financial Mentor. He adds, “AI adoption is still evolving, and this correction offers a long-term opportunity rather than a reason to exit.”\n\nAt this level, experts say, even a sharp drawdown in tech stocks has a limited impact on overall portfolio value. When tech funds form only a small part of your portfolio, you can afford to observe how companies adapt to AI-driven changes without being forced into hasty decisions.\n\nWhen tech exposure dominate the portfolio\n\nThe equation changes when technology funds account for 15-30 percent or more of the equity allocation.\n\n“At higher exposure levels, technology stops being a theme and becomes a portfolio risk factor,” says Vijay Maheshwari, CWM and Founder, Stocktick Capital. He adds, “In periods of structural uncertainty, concentration must fall before conviction rises.”\n\nOther industry experts also highlight the need for action at elevated exposure levels. Gandhi says, “If investors are overexposed through thematic tech funds, this is the time to rebalance. Concentration risk can hurt portfolios during prolonged disruption, and gradual diversification into flexi-cap or multi-asset funds helps reduce that risk.”\n\nImportantly, experts stress that rebalancing does not mean exiting tech altogether. Reducing exposure gradually while maintaining a core allocation can help avoid timing risk while restoring balance.\n\nSIP investors often assume that continuing investments automatically neutralises market risk. While SIPs help average costs, they do not eliminate the risks of valuation compression or business model uncertainty.\n\n“SIP decisions should be driven by why the fund exists in the portfolio, not by recent price action,” Maheshwari says. He explains, “SIPs are designed for volatility, not for blind persistence when business visibility weakens.”\n\nIndustry experts say investors should evaluate whether their tech SIPs are still relevant. Gandhi adds, “SIP investors should avoid knee-jerk exits, but they must also review asset allocation. Investors should ask whether the fund is focused on legacy IT models or adapting to AI and automation.”\n\nA simple rule of thumb can be followed: if tech funds account for no more than 10-12 percent of total SIP allocations, experts say continuing SIPs is reasonable. If that share exceeds 20 percent, rebalancing future SIP flows may be prudent.\n\nLump-sum investors: avoid blind averaging\n\nFor lump-sum investors who entered tech funds near recent highs, the temptation to average down after a correction can be strong. But experts caution that not all falls are equal.\n\nMaheshwari says, “Averaging purely because prices are lower is not investing; it is anchoring. In disruptive phases, clarity beats cheapness.”\n\nSo, before adding more, look for signs of valuation comfort, earnings resilience and clear evidence that companies are adapting their business models to AI, rather than relying on optimistic commentary alone.\n\nGandhi advises patience. He adds, “Recent lump-sum investors should wait for stability. Monitoring valuation resets, earnings downgrades and global IT order flows is more important than rushing to add exposure.”\n\nThe recent fall in IT stocks is a reminder that thematic investing can be rewarding, but it also comes with sharper ups and downs. Technology funds can still have a place in portfolios, but only in measured amounts and with clear expectations.\n\nThe real takeaway is not about guessing when IT stocks will bounce back. It is about ensuring your portfolio is balanced enough to handle uncertainty without forcing rushed decisions. Staying aligned with your goals, rather than reacting to headlines, is what ultimately helps ride through phases like this.",

        "full_content": "This is something that most people don’t pay attention to until it’s too late: what happens when someone who has taken a personal loan dies? Does the loan end with them as well?\n\nThe short answer is: no, it doesn’t. But the debt does not automatically transfer to the spouse or children either. In effect, what happens to the loan depends on who signed what and whether they had bought any insurance alongwith the loan or not.\n\nIf the loan was taken individually\n\nWhen a person takes apersonal loanin their own name, without a co-borrower, the responsibility of repaying the loan is theirs and their alone. After they die, the bank cannot chase their family members to repay the loan, unless the family member/s were legally named in the loan as co-borrowers or guarantors.\n\nThe bank, however, can recover dues from the deceased borrower’s estate, including their savings accounts, fixed deposits, mutual funds, property or any other financial holdings.\n\nBefore the heirs inherit the assets, any outstanding liabilities are settled. So if someone has assets worth, say, Rs 10 lakh, which they have left behind after they died, and they also have unpaid personal loan dues worth Rs 3 lakh, the bank or lender can stake a claim over Rs 3 lakh from the assets. The remaining Rs 7 lakh would then pass to the legal heirs.\n\nIf the estate does not have enough money to cover the debt, the bank usually has to write off the balance. Family members are not required to pay from their own income or savings, unless they had signed as co-borrowers or guarantors.\n\nIn case there was a co-borrower to the loan, that person of course will be held liable to pay off the rest of the loan. In many cases, people takeloansjointly alongwith their spouses to increase the likelihood of getting a loan.\n\nIn such cases, if one co-borrower dies, the surviving co-borrower must repay the EMIs. The bank will treat the loan as fully enforceable against the remaining borrower.\n\nThis is important because many people assume “joint” only improves eligibility. In reality, it also means that the responsibility for the payment of the loan is shared.\n\nA guarantor signs a legal undertaking to repay the loan if the primary borrower is unable to pay back the loan. If the borrower dies and the estate cannot cover the outstanding amount, the lender can legally approach the guarantor for repayment. In this case, the guarantor’s personal assets and income may be sought by the bank if the loan remains unpaid.\n\nAgreeing to be a guarantor is not just a rubber stamp; it carries real financial consequences.\n\nWhat about personal loan insurance\n\nSometimes the borrower might have taken credit life insurance along with personal loan. This means that the insurance company must clear any outstanding loan amount if the borrower dies while the loan is still active.\n\nIf this is the case, the family will need to file a claim with the insurer, submit the death certificate and other documents required by the insurance company. Once their claim is approved, the insurer then pays the remaining loan amount directly to the bank.\n\nNot all loans come with this cover, and sometimes borrowers decline it to reduce upfront costs. In such cases, there is no insurance safety net.\n\nWhat families should do immediately\n\nAfter a borrower’s death, the most important thing to do is to inform the lender quickly. You will need to provide a death certificate after which you can ask for a statement of outstanding dues.\n\nDon’t just continue to pay the EMIs blindly without understanding what the exact liability is. First confirm whether the loan was individual, joint or guaranteed, and whether any insurance was taken.\n\nIt may also be helpful to consult a lawyer if the estate involves significant assets or disputes among heirs.\n\nDebt does not die automatically, but neither does it automatically burden the family.\n\nThe key factors are simple: who signed the loan, whether insurance exists and what assets the borrower left behind.\n\nFor anyone taking a personal loan today, this is a reminder to keep documentation clear, consider loan insurance for large amounts and ensure family members understand the structure. Planning ahead can prevent financial confusion at a time when emotions are already overwhelming.",

        "full_content": "\"We have been preparing for higher regulatory expectations well in advance,” said Nirmal Jain, Founder, IIFL Finance, in an exclusive interview toMoneycontrolthis week when asked what plans IIFL Finance has, should it get classified as an upper layer NBFC in the next few months.\n\n“The last two years have been about reset, resilience, and rebuilding trust. We have strengthened compliance frameworks, tightened risk governance, simplified business mix, and improved transparency with regulators and investors,” he said.\n\nJain didn’t seem too perturbed about the fluctuation in gold prices and its impact on IIFL Finance’s core gold loan business as loan-to-value (LTV) is at a comfortable level.\n\nDespite good numbers in Q3FY26, the market is not giving credit to the financial performance. What is hurting sentiments for IIFL Finance at this point?\n\nThe markets are reacting more to overhangs and perception risks than to quarterly numbers now. Over the last two years, we have gone through a period of exceptional disruptions, like regulatory action on goldloans,clean-up in microfinance (MFI) and unsecured portfolios, and, more recently, a procedural income-tax audit.\n\nWhile none of these impact our business fundamentals today, the sentiment typically takes longer to normalise. Our focus is on consistent execution, transparency, and sustainable growth, and we believe markets eventually reward that.\n\nYou are seeing good growth in the gold business, which, to a large extent, is attributable to price appreciation, but there is also some element of tonnage growth. Do you see this trend sustainable?\n\nGold price appreciation has certainly expanded the addressable market, but what is equally important is that due to tighter credit norms and reduced availability of unsecured loans, demand for gold loans has structurally strengthened. We are seeing genuine tonnage growth, driven by customer reacquisition, post-embargo, improved branch productivity, and a broader shift away from unsecured credit. Growth rates may normalise from recent highs, but the underlying demand and business momentum remain sustainable.\n\nSome players, especially private banks, are getting cautious on gold loans, given the price-led growth momentum. What is your view and is IIFL Finance altering its ticket sizes to shield from potential depreciation in gold prices?\n\nCaution is prudent in any lending business, and we have always followed a conservative approach. Our average LTV is around 60–61 percent, well below the regulatory ceiling. This provides a strong buffer, even in the event of gold price volatility. We are not chasing growth by stretching ticket sizes or LTVs. Our focus is on risk-adjusted growth, not headline growth. We also closely monitor LTV and mark-to-market movements at the customer level through our branch network.\n\nUntil 6–9 months back, the company had confidence in unsecured loans, including micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) segment. That seems to have changed and you are de-growing the book. What went wrong?\n\nNothing “went wrong”, in the sense of execution failure, but the risk-reward equation and the operating environment changed. After the regulatory clampdown on unsecured credit, availability shrank, and there was also some contagion from the MFI stress into individual unsecured loans. In hindsight, unsecured lending had expanded very rapidly across the industry. While the future can never be predicted with certainty, what matters is recognising early signals and quick course-correction. We saw early signs of stress as borrower leverage increased and took a conscious decision to step back, clean up, and recalibrate rather than defend growth. This has helped protect asset quality and earnings stability.\n\nThe housing finance arm is also going through some course correction. Can the unit be ready for listing in 3–6 months as reported in media?\n\nOur immediate priority is strengthening the business model, asset quality, and leadership depth at the housing finance subsidiary. We have discontinued Micro LAP (loan against property), which will help us maintain asset quality at a much better level. We have a robust branch network, trained teams, and strong reach in smaller towns, and we will focus on our strengths by building in the affordable and emerging housing segments. The board will evaluate listing options at an appropriate time, keeping market conditions and business readiness in mind. Any decision on timing will be taken in a disciplined and value-accretive manner, not driven by headlines.\n\nDeals are starting to happen in the MFI space and at benign valuations. What are your monetisation plans for IIFL Samasta?\n\nThe microfinance business has gone through phases of volatility multiple times, and we are now growing cautiously. Our current focus is on stabilising performance, improving collections, and restoring normalised profitability. Once the business demonstrates steady-state metrics and market conditions are conducive, we will evaluate strategic monetisation options, keeping shareholder value firmly in mind.\n\nOn a standalone basis, IIFL Finance is nearing the upper-layer threshold. Internally, what are your plans for that elevation?\n\nWe have been preparing for higher regulatory expectations well in advance. This includes stronger governance, deeper risk controls, conservative capital buffers, and greater use of co-lending and direct assignment to manage balance-sheet intensity. From a systems, compliance, and capital standpoint, we are already operating with an upper-layer mindset. We also plan to leverage our branch network and customer base to expand MSME lending and diversify the portfolio, so that growth is not overly concentrated on gold loans.\n\nThe last two years have been extremely difficult for the company, starting with the ban on gold loans in March 2024 and an IT-related issue a year later. What efforts are being undertaken to put these issues to rest forever?\n\nThe last two years have been about reset, resilience, and rebuilding trust. We have strengthened compliance frameworks, tightened risk governance, simplified business mix, and improved transparency with regulators and investors. They were not cosmetic changes but structural corrections. We believe this phase has made the institution stronger, more disciplined, and better prepared for long-term growth.",

        "full_content": "The rupee could see further upside and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) unlikely to actively intervene in the market in the near term, Vikas Jain, Head of India FICC Trading at Bank of America, said in an interview toMoneycontrol.\n\nHe said it is difficult to pinpoint exact levels at which the central bank may step into the foreign exchange market, especially given the already comfortable level of forex reserves. “While we are at a high level of reserves, we are not expecting the RBI to start accumulating anytime soon,” Jain said.Edited excerpts of the interview:\n\nThe rupee has seen a sharp rally after the US–India trade deal. Do you think this move is sustainable or we'll see some volatility?\n\nSince the announcement of the trade deal with the US, the dynamics of the currency market have clearly changed. Sentiment-driven demand for the rupee has strengthened but there are a few things we need to closely watch to predict the future course of dollar-rupee.\n\nFirst, FPIs are still a bit concerned about the US-India trade relationship, so whether there is a slowdown or pause in flows remains important. Second, there was clearly a timing factor involved in this move. Third, the role of the RBI, whether it intervenes at current levels or starts accumulating reserves again, is something to track.\n\nThat said, we are positive at this point. We believe FPIs will reduce their selling and some buying could come in over the next few quarters. Exporters may also look to increase their hedging ratios. RBI, in our view, is unlikely to be very aggressive in rebuilding reserves immediately.\n\nFebruary and March are typically seasonally strong for the rupee. Does that add to your positive outlook?\n\nYes, February and March are generally seasonally positive months. We expect the current account to be positive as well, which should support the rupee. Given this background, we remain hopeful for the currency going forward.\n\nThe RBI already holds large forex reserves, around 11 months of import cover. Given the sharp intraday appreciation on February 3, how much more can RBI realistically accumulate?\n\nIt is very difficult to predict exact levels where RBI may step in. While we are at a high level of reserves, we are not expecting the RBI to start accumulating anytime soon.\n\nThe rupee has depreciated significantly not just against the dollar but also against the euro and other currencies. Because of that, we believe there is still room for the rupee to move higher and the RBI may stay on the sidelines for now rather than adding to reserves.\n\nRBI’s intervention strategy has been unpredictable recently, especially with the build-up in the forward book due to swaps. How do you see RBI managing this?\n\nThe forward book is largely in the three-year segment, though some of it has now moved into the two-year maturity as well. Last year’s $10 billion auction has now become a two-year maturity.\n\nImportantly, the maturities are now spread out. There are some near term forward maturities for next two months and post that there isn’t much. This gives RBI a lot more flexibility. In the immediate term, we need to see whether RBI rolls over these maturities or lets them run off.\n\nIn our view, the RBI is likely to roll over those maturities. Overall, I am not too concerned about the forward book at this stage.\n\nFrom here, how much more appreciation do you see in the rupee?\n\nWe believe another 1.5-2 percent appreciation is still possible over the next couple of months. By March-end, we are targeting levels around 88.60-89 a dollar.\n\nThere is no such thing as an “ideal” level, but we believe the rupee can move in that direction given current conditions.\n\nDo you expect a turnaround in FPI flows into equities and debt after this deal?\n\nYes, equities definitely have a good possibility of seeing inflows. On the debt side as well, we have already seen some positive flows and we believe these can continue.\n\nDespite the sharp currency move, bond markets have reacted only marginally. Why hasn’t the bond market cheered this deal?\n\nThe deal does not directly impact bonds. It does not open new avenues for bond investors. Bond yields are higher mainly because the market was surprised by the gross borrowing number in the Budget.\n\nPost-Budget, yields moved 5-6 basis points higher. Today, we have seen a small retracement of 3-4 basis points due to the deal. Fundamentally, nothing has changed for bonds, which is why the reaction is muted.\n\nGiven rate cuts and higher borrowing, could yields rise sharply again, like in 2022?\n\nTen-year yields are trading around 6.72 percent, almost a 147-basis-point premium over the policy rate, which is historically on the higher side.\n\nOne key reason is that banks have reduced their G-Sec holdings significantly due to changes in the deposit-to-investment ratio. However, we don’t think banks have much room left to reduce this further.\n\nEven with higher gross and net supply, demand-supply dynamics look manageable. Hence, we do not expect a significant jump in yields from here.\n\nWill the RBI need to continue OMOs and liquidity operations in FY27?\n\nIf liquidity is required, RBI will provide it. At this point, we believe the banking system will remain in surplus for at least the next six months.\n\nBy the end of this week, surplus liquidity could reach Rs 3 lakh crore. Even after advance tax outflows, government spending should support liquidity. Overall, we expect surplus liquidity of around 1.5 percent of NDTL, which is sufficient.\n\nIf liquidity remains surplus, RBI may not need to do further OMOs or buy-sell swaps.\n\nDoes surplus liquidity get unevenly distributed across banks?\n\nLiquidity gets distributed only if surplus is maintained consistently. If liquidity comes and goes, it does not help the system. If RBI maintains surplus liquidity for a sustained period, it will naturally get distributed among banks.\n\nGoing forward, if currency remains supportive and liquidity outflows reduce, RBI may not need additional interventions.\n\nWhat are your expectations from the upcoming RBI policy?\n\nWe are not expecting any change in rates. On liquidity, RBI will commit as much as the system requires.",

        "full_content": "An average Indian juggles multiple loans at once – a home loan, a car loan, a couple of credit card EMIs, maybe a personal loan taken during an emergency. While they may all seem manageable, once they quietly start squeezing your finances, you may need to intervene and gain some control.\n\nFirst, know your real EMI burden\n\nIf you do find yourself in a situation where your multipleloansseem to be spinning out of control, the first thing to do is not to panic. Instead, try and get some information. Start by calculating your total monthly EMIs. Not just a rough calculation, but precisely how much EMI goes out each month.\n\nInclude every EMI, like credit card minimum payments.\n\nThen compare this to your monthly take-home salary. Ideally, your total EMIs should not be more than 40-50 percent of your total income. If they are more than that, if you are faced with even a small unforeseen emergency, your finances can push you into stress.\n\nIf you are already above this range, it is time to take corrective steps rather than waiting for a bounce to happen.\n\nPrioritise high interest loans\n\nNot all loans are equal. Credit card dues and personal loans usually carry the highest interest rates. Home loans and education loans are typically cheaper.\n\nIf you have surplus funds, prepay the costliest loan first. Clearing a 30 percent credit card debt makes more financial sense than prepaying a 9 percent home loan.\n\nReducing high interest loans first frees up cash flow faster.\n\nOne common mistake is paying only the minimum due on credit cards. It keeps you technically compliant, but interest keeps compounding.\n\nIf you cannot clear the full amount, pay as much above the minimum as possible. Otherwise, you are just postponing the problem.\n\nConsider consolidation carefully\n\nIf you are juggling several small loans at high rates, consolidation can help. A single lower interestpersonal loanreplacing multiple high interest debts can simplify tracking and reduce overall interest.\n\nBut be careful. Consolidation works only if you stop adding fresh debt. Otherwise, you end up with one big loan and new smaller ones again.\n\nEven one EMI bounce can hurt your credit profile.\n\nSet up auto debit instructions and keep a buffer in your bank account. It is better to keep one extra EMI amount idle than risk a missed payment.\n\nYour credit score affects future borrowing costs. Protect it deliberately.\n\nMany people with multiple loans have zero emergency fund. That is dangerous.\n\nEven while repaying debt, try to build at least three months of essential expenses in a liquid instrument. Without this cushion, any medical issue or job disruption pushes you toward more borrowing.\n\nDo not keep upgrading your lifestyle\n\nMultiple loans often signal one thing: lifestyle expansion.\n\nIf your income has not grown proportionately, pause big purchases. No new gadgets, no impulsive travel on EMI, no additional “easy” credit offers.\n\nStability first. Upgrades later.\n\nTalk to lenders early if stressed\n\nIf you genuinely feel repayment is becoming difficult, speak to your lender before defaulting. Banks are more flexible when approached early than after repeated missed payments.\n\nRestructuring options or temporary relief may be possible in genuine hardship cases.\n\nManaging multiple loans is less about intelligence and more about discipline. Know your numbers, prioritise correctly, protect your credit and resist adding new debt.\n\nHandled carefully, multiple loans do not have to derail your financial life. Ignored, they can quietly erode it.",

Its exclusion indicates that this specific governance provision would be implemented later, likely rule-making, regulatory clarifications and operational frameworks are put in place by the government and the regulator.\n\n“The implementation of the amended insurance laws permitting 100 percent FDI represents a major step forward for India’s insurance sector, offering long-term clarity and reinforcing confidence among global and domestic stakeholders,” said Hanut Mehta, CEO and co-founder of Bimapay Finsure. “More than just higher capital participation, the reforms focus on strengthening governance, enhancing transparency, and prioritising policyholder interests across the ecosystem.”\n\nMehta pointed to structural safeguards embedded in the reforms, including the creation of a dedicated policyholder education fund, alignment with the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act for data protection, and a more consultative regulatory approach.\n\n“These measures signal a clear shift towards a consumer-centric and trust-based market, which will be essential in sustaining credibility as global participation increases,” he said.",

If you need money in the near future, you can redeem units before April 1 to avail tax exemption.\n\n\"For the point on premature exit, no capital gains tax is payable on profit up to March 31, 2026,\" said Rajesh H Gandhi, Partner, Deloitte India.\n\nThis means that for primary subscribers, both five-year and eight-year redemptions through the RBI are currently tax-free.\n\nPurchased from RBI, sold in the secondary market\n\nIf a primary subscriber sells SGBs in the secondary market, the gains will be taxed at 12.5 percent as long-term capital gains (LTCG), irrespective of whether the sale occurs before or after April 1.\n\nThe tax exemption applies only if bonds are held until maturity and redeemed by the RBI. The choice between selling in the secondary market or holding until maturity will depend on the estimated capital appreciation of staying invested, compared with the tax payable under LTCG on immediate sale.\n\n\"For instance, Mr A had invested in 2021 Original Issue in SGB’s from RBI at Rs 4777 per gram. If the units are sold in the secondary market at the current approximate rate of Rs 15,500 per gram, Mr A will be liable to pay Rs 1,278 in LTCG tax on gains of Rs 10,223 at 12.5 percent,\" BCAS joint secretary Mrinal Mehta said.\n\nIf he holds it until maturity, Mr A will not have to pay any tax and will also benefit from capital appreciation. “Clearly, staying invested seems ideal if you are a primary subscriber,\" he added.\n\nBought and sold in the secondary market\n\nIf unit holders bought the bonds from the secondary market, the tax treatment changes slightly. Irrespective of how long they hold the bonds, any sale in the secondary market attracts capital gains tax. Gains are taxed as short-term capital gains (STCG) if the holding period is up to 12 months and as LTCG if the holding period exceeds 12 months, with LTCG taxed at 12.5 percent.\n\nPurchased from the secondary market, redeeming at maturity\n\nThe Budget 2026 amendment will affect investors who bought SGBs in the secondary market. The maturity proceeds will now be taxed from April 1 on, even though they were previously broadly exempt. Therefore, if you want to redeem them now, you can do so to reduce your tax liability.\n\n\"If Mr A has bought SGB from the secondary market in 2021, holds the bonds till maturity, still will be liable to LTCG @ 12.5 percent,\" Mehta said.\n\nGandhi said, \"The essence of the budget amendment is to bring to tax those redemptions (post 1 April 2026) for which the purchases have been made in the secondary markets.\"",

If the two are not linked within the prescribed timeline, your PAN can become inoperative, which means you will be unable to file returns, process refunds, or carry out many financial transactions.\n\nWhile most people link their PAN and Aadhaar online through the Income Tax Department portal, but if you prefer the offline, in-person route, you can easily do so at authorised PAN service centres.\n\nWhere you can link PAN and Aadhaar\n\nThere are several options for linking your PAN and your Aadhaar number. It can be done online through the Income Tax Department’s e filing portal, or at authorised PAN service centres operated by agencies such as NSDL (Protean) and UTIITSL, or in certain cases, through facilitation centres of the Income Tax Department.\n\nIf you are not comfortable doing using the online portal or face errors regarding authentication, you can visit a service centre.\n\nWhen visiting a PAN service centre, you must carry your PAN and Aadhaar cards, a copy of both the documents, and the applicable fee, if late linking charges are applicable.\n\nIf your name, date of birth or gender details are different in your PAN and Aadhaar cards, you may be asked to first correct the mismatch before linking the two.\n\nAt the centre, you will need to fill out a form requesting for PAN-Aadhaar linking. The operator will verify your details in the system. In some cases, you may need to do biometric-based authentication if Aadhaar-based verification fails.\n\nThere may be a fee for linking your PAN and Aadhaar, which you will need to generate and pay through a challan system before the linking request is accepted. The centre staff can guide you on the exact payment steps.\n\nOnce the request is submitted, you will receive an acknowledgement. Linking is usually confirmed through SMS or can be checked later on the Income Tax portal.\n\nIt is important to link your PAN and Aadhaar because not doing so will render your PAN inoperative. If that happens, you will not be able file your income tax return, any pending IT refunds may not get processed, TDS may be deducted at a higher rate, and banks may also restrict certain high value transactions.\n\nInoperative PAN does not mean your PAN has been cancelled, but it effectively becomes unusable for financial purposes until you link it.\n\nBefore visiting a service centre, check your PAN-Aadhaar linking status online. If it is already linked, there is no need to visit physically.\n\nIf there is a mismatch in name or date of birth, correct the error first. If these details don’t match, linking will fail even at the centre.\n\nLinking your PAN and Aadhaar numbers is not a complicated process and ignoring it can create unnecessary financial disturbances. If the online steps feel too overwhelming, authorised service centres can complete the process smoothly with proper documentation.",

These numbers are often treated as indicators of market mood, but what do they actually represent, and how are they calculated?\n\nWhat do Sensex and Nifty levels indicate?\n\nSensex and Nifty act as broad indicators of how India’s stock market is performing. They reflect the combined performance of some of the country’s largest and most influential listed companies.\n\nWhen these indices rise, it generally suggests positive investor sentiment and expectations of economic or corporate growth. When they fall, it may indicate caution or uncertainty among investors.\n\nWhat exactly are Sensex and Nifty?\n\nSensex and Nifty are stock market indices, meaning they track the performance of a selected group of stocks.\n\nSensex tracks 30 large, well-established companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). It is India’s oldest stock market index and was introduced in 1979.\n\nNifty 50 tracks 50 major companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). It was launched in 1995.\n\nTogether, they offer a snapshot of the broader equity market rather than the performance of individual stocks.\n\nHow are Sensex and Nifty levels calculated?\n\nBoth indices use the free-float market capitalisation method, which focuses only on shares that are available for public trading.\n\nThe formula: Index Value = (Total Free Float Market Capitalisation ÷ Base Market Capitalisation) × Base Index Value\n\nHere’s how each component works.\n\nMarket capitalisation is the total value of a company’s shares in the market.\n\nMarket Capitalisation = Share Price × Total Number of Shares\n\nFor example, if a company’s share price is Rs 2,500 and it has 6.5 billion shares outstanding, its market capitalisation would be Rs 16,250 billion.\n\nNot all shares are freely traded. Promoter holdings, government stakes, and certain institutional shares are excluded.\n\nThe free-float factor represents the proportion of shares available for public trading.\n\nIf only 50 percent of a company’s shares are freely tradable, the free-float factor is 0.5.\n\nStep 3:Free-float market capitalisation\n\nThis is calculated by multiplying market capitalisation by the free-float factor.\n\nIn the example above: Rs 16,250 billion × 0.5 = Rs 8,125 billion\n\nStep 4:Total free-float market capitalisation\n\nFor Sensex, the free-float market capitalisation of all 30 constituent companies is added together. For Nifty, the same is done for 50 companies.\n\nStep 5:Applying the base value\n\nThis total is divided by the base market capitalisation (set when the index was created) and multiplied by the base index value.\n\nThe result is the current index level.\n\nHow are companies selected for Sensex and Nifty?\n\nIndex constituents are chosen based on defined criteria, including:\n\nOnly companies that meet these benchmarks are included, and the list is reviewed periodically.\n\nSensex and Nifty are more than headline figures. They represent the collective performance of India’s leading companies, adjusted for shares actually traded in the market. Understanding how they are calculated helps investors interpret market movements more clearly, and separate sentiment from substance.",

As cross-border payment providers, we hope to grow as our customers grow,” he said.\n\nXflow works with IT and goods exporters as also AI and SaaS companies and expects growth across sectors as export activity increases.\n\nAfter months of uncertainty, US President Donald Trump announced that the two countries had reached a trade deal, which was acknowledged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  The US will lower tariffs on Indian goods from a punishing 50 percent to 18 percent, with two sides talking of deepening bilateral trade and improving market access.\n\nThe US remains India’s largest trading partner and the agreement aims to support exporters through smoother trade flows and stronger supply chain integration. Industry executives say clarity on execution, timelines and compliance requirements will be critical to determine the impact of the trade agreement.\n\nCross-border payments pick up pace\n\nPayments companies say exporter demand has widened beyond traditional IT services to include D2C brands, B2B manufacturers, specialised goods exporters and SaaS firms.\n\nAkash Sinha, CEO and co-founder of Cashfree Payments, said the trade deal strengthens India’s position in global commerce. He noted that for Indian SMEs, the opportunity lies not only in tariffs but also in easier access, improved competitiveness and new revenue streams in the US market.\n\nPayment gateway companies that got PA-CB licences will benefit, as this will lift export businesses. The SaaS solutions tailored for SMEs after the RBI licence will help them take a larger share from the likes of PayPal and Payoneer\n\nThe positive sentiment comes at a time when India’s payments ecosystem is witnessing steady activity.\n\nSeveral fintech firms have raised capital over the past year to expand international payment capabilities, while regulators have moved to formalise oversight of payment companies.\n\nIndia’s inward remittances exceed $120 billion annually, with outward remittances at around $25 billion. Services exports, including IT, consulting and digital services, have overtaken goods exports, making cross-border collections a growing policy focus.\n\nLarge payment gateway players are positioning themselves to capture this shift. Razorpay, which recently received its PA-CB licence, said the approval strengthens its ability to serve businesses operating across borders.\n\nCashfree Payments has also scaled up its cross-border push. Its cross-border payment volumes grew 250 percent year-on-year and now account for more than 10 percent of revenue, which expected to rise to 30 percent next year, the company said.\n\nWhile incumbents bring scale, newer players such as Skydo, XFlow and Briskpe are betting on underserved segments.",

While Ashish Agrawal delivered one of the firm’s biggest outcomes through its bet on Groww, a Rs 230 crore investment that multiplied 75X into a Rs 17,300 crore outcome for Peak XV in the past year, Ishaan Mittal was an early backer of another fintech success story, Razorpay, a Rs 63,000 crore fintech major now heading for an IPO.\n\nBased on these conversations, three developments appear to have converged. Matters came to a head just over the past three to four days, triggered by differences over payouts linked to the Groww outcome and disagreements on how profits and carried interest in the new venture fund should be structured.\n\nCarried interest, or carry, is the money venture capitalists earn on profits made on investment – often in many millions\n\n“All partners were aligned until about a week ago. But tensions began building over the last five to six days, which led to Ashish deciding to quit abruptly, with the other two following suit,” said one person familiar with the matter.\n\nAnother person briefed on the developments said that while Groww was undeniably a strong outcome, returns at a venture firm could not be attributed to a single individual.\n\n“There are multiple contributors: who sources the deal, who signs the cheque, who decides on follow-on investments, and who supports the portfolio company across functions like talent, finance and operations. The institution is larger than any one individual,” the person said, adding that the disagreements were economic in nature.\n\nThose “economic disagreements\" sources said, were twofold: incentives and payouts linked to the outsized Groww outcome delivered by Agrawal, and his share of carried interest in the new fund.\n\n“The demand for a higher share of carry in the new fund came at a stage when most discussions with limited partners were nearly concluded and documents were close to being signed,” a third person said.\n\nAccording to sources, these friction points were primarily between Agrawal and Peak XV’s senior partners. “Ishaan and TJ are part of the growth funds and were not involved in the new venture fund. But the three have been close friends for nearly 15 years, and Ashish’s exit became the trigger for them to leave together and strike out on their own,” a fourth person said.\n\nPeak XV Partners did not respond to queries sent by Moneycontrol. Agrawal declined to comment beyond what he shared on social media regarding his departure and future.\n\nPeak XV Partners’ managing director Shailendra Singh, however, said in media interviews that the exits stemmed from “economic disagreements” with Agrawal, without offering further details.\n\nPeak XV Partners had as many as 15 Partners and Managing Directors until a few months ago. However, a total of eight Partners/MDs have quit the firm in recent months, including three top-level departures earlier this week.\n\nThese exits are in addition to the churn in the mid-management layer of the investing team and other departures in non-investing teams, including head of marketing, policy functions and more.\n\nPartner exits at VC funds are not new and uncommon, but when several of its top-performing partners exit in quick succession, fund sponsors – or limited partners (LPs) – ask tougher  questions around future bets and on the potential to earn outsized returns from them.\n\nGroww was one of the biggest wins for an investor from the VC circle and Peak was an early backer, having invested in the company around 6-7 years ago.\n\nPeak XV will make a total of around Rs 17,300 crore (around $2 billion) on an investment of just Rs 230 crore (about $26 million as per the USD/INR exchange rate six years ago), a 75X return in record time, as per current stock prices. The value of the outcome will change depending on the stock price direction. Of the total stake,Peak has already pocketed gains of around Rs 1,500 crore(around $180 million), by selling shares as part of the offer for sale (OFS) component during Groww’s IPO in November, an 8X returns, and it still continues to hold a significant share in the company, as per a-back-of-the envelope calculation.\n\nThe three – Agrawal, Mittal and Sharma – are setto start their own fund. Options like an equal partnership vehicle, including an arrangement where all three are based in Bengaluru are currently being discussed, according to people aware of the developments. The finer contours, including how much money they will raise are still being worked out.\n\nWill the recent top-level exits at Peak XV Partners hinder its ongoing fundraise?\n\nWhile the fundraising process is in the advanced stages, sources say this will lead to fresh questions on the depth of investing partners and stability in the fund. “The LPs had digested the previous exits, but losing three partners again will not go down well,” a fifth person said.\n\nOver the past two years or so, top executives like Piyush Gupta, Abheek Anand, Anandamoy Roychowdhary, Shailesh Lakhani, Harshjit Sethi have all left Peak XV Partners. Of those, while Gupta has already launched his fund, Lakhani and Sethi are in the process of launching a deep tech fund and raising money for the same.\n\nThe current disruptions at Peak are reminiscent of what transpired when it was Sequoia Capital India, before breaking away in 2023.\n\nAround 2011, top executives such as Sumir Chadha, KP Balaraj, SK Jain, Sandeep Singhal all left to start WestBridge Capital. Then again, in 2018, Abhay Pandey, Gautam Mago, VT Bharadwaj left the VC fund to start A91 Partners. Both Westbridge Capital and A91 Partners are among the most prolific and well regarded investors in the country today.\n\nPeak XV’s growth funds today are helmed by Shailendra J Singh, GV Ravishankar and Mohit Bhatnagar. While Singh has been based in Singapore and is increasingly spending time in the US to focus on AI bets, Ravishankar relocated to Dubai a few years ago and is in the process of moving back to Bengaluru. Bhatnagar is based in New Delhi. Rajan Anandan takes care of its very early stage program Surge.\n\nWhile Peak XV internally promoted Abhishek Mohan to Managing Director and General Partner from Principal in the venture team and Saipriya Sarangan has been elevated to chief operating officer from chief people officer as part of its announcement yesterday, it remains to be seen how Singh and GV restore stability and boost investor confidence in the coming months.\n\nPeak XV, by a back of the envelope calculation accounts for around fifth of the total money invested into the Indian startup ecosystem. Since being set up around 17 years back, it has invested in over 400 companies, from across 16 funds, of which over 50 are unicorns and more than 23 have gone public. It now manages over $9 billion in assets. Its stability will have an important bearing for the Indian startup ecosystem.",

        "full_content": "Gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETF) gained sharply in trade on February 4 as precious metals extended rise. This came after the ETFs along with the metals sharply crashed earlier.\n\nDespite the ongoing rebound, gold and silver, along with their respective ETFs are yet to scale back to their lifetime highs which they hit in late January this year.\n\nGold futures with April expiry on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) jumped more than 4.5 percent to trade at Rs 1,60,755 per 10 grams in the morning trading hours. The contracts with June and August expiries meanwhile gained around 5 percent each.\n\nSilver futures with March expiry jumped 6 percent to trade at Rs 2,84,094 per kilogram. The contracts with May and July expiries surged 6 percent and 5 percent respectively.\n\nTata Silver ETFgained around 9 percent, while Kotak Silver ETF gained around 8 percent.Nippon India Silver ETF, ICICI Prudential Silver ETF, SBI Silver ETF, Aditya Birla Sun Life ETF and UTI Silver ETF gained more than 7 percent each, as seen at 10.30 am.\n\nGroww Silver ETF,HDFC Silver ETF, Zerodha Silver ETF and others gained around 7 percent each, while Edelweiss Silver ETF gained around 9 percent.\n\nThe Wealth Company Gold ETF gained around 7 percent, while Quantum Gold ETF and Edelweiss Gold ETF gained more than 5 percent each. Choice Gold ETF, Motilal Oswal Gold ETF, DSP Gold ETF, Axis MF Gold ETF,Tata Gold ETF, Union Gold ETF, Zerodha Gold ETF, LIC MF Gold ETF, SBI Gold ETF, Invesco India Gol ETF, Nippon India ETF GoldBees and others gained more than 4 percent each.\n\nGold and silver prices have rebounded significantly from their near-term bottoms. “After a recent fall, Gold price has pullback from the 38% of Fib. Retracement level placed at 137,728. Immediate resistance would be at 23% of Fib. Retracement level placed at 154,215. Breakout of this level will boost the upside momentum in Gold price and next resistance would be at 160,000 – 167,000,” said Aamir Makda, Commodity & Currency Analyst, Choice Broking.\n\n“On the other side, Silver price has started trading over 50% of Fib. Retracement level which is at 253,468, having pullback towards 38% of Fib. Retracement level placed at 292,928. Breakout of this level will continue the upward move in Silver ahead and next hurdle would be at 341,773,” he added.\n\nThe analyst expects a moderately bullish trend in gold and silver ahead in this week.\n\nA dramatic unwind which hit gold and silver markets recently, erased a chunk of their record breaking January gains. The plunge began after CME Group hiked margin requirements on both metals, forcing leveraged traders to liquidate positions and accelerating a wave of selling. In additions, the selloff intensified as markets digested reports that US President Donald Trump is set to nominate Kevin Warsh—viewed as a hawkish, dollar supportive choice—as the next Federal Reserve Chair. The shift revived expectations of tighter policy and triggered a sharp rebound in the U.S. dollar, which is negative for precious metals.\n\n“The correction was amplified by extreme overbought conditions after gold and silver touched unprecedented highs just days earlier, with silver having surged more than 60% in a month and gold over 20%. Profit taking cascaded into panic selling as liquidity thinned and volatility spiked,” said Hareesh V, Head of Commodity Research, Geojit Investments.\n\n“The violent drop more like a technical correction than a deterioration in core fundamentals, noting that longer term drivers—geopolitical tensions, central bank buying and macro uncertainty—remain intact,” he added.\n\n\"It's a reasonable call that this is somewhere around fair value potentially, if you consider that we saw a market behaving fairly irrationally for a few weeks there,\" Reuters quoted Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.com, as saying.\n\nThe sharp rise in the precious metals also comes amid rising expectations for at least two rate cuts by the American Federal Reserve this year.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

January’s PMI remains lower than the 2025 average of 59.4.\n\nThe rebound in services mirrors improving conditions in manufacturing, where the pace of expansion also picked up. Manufacturing PMI rose to 55.4 in January from 55 in December, pointing to a broad-based recovery across key segments of the economy.\n\nMoneycontrol Economy Pulse, a real-time indicator of economic momentum, had signalled a faster pickup in December.\n\nThe improvement in business activity comes amid expectations of stronger external and domestic tailwinds in 2026. Business sentiment had risen to a three-month high in January.\n\nIndia’s growth outlook has been bolstered by the conclusion of trade agreements with the European Union and the United States, which are expected to improve export competitiveness and investment sentiment.\n\nOn February 2, US President Donald Trump announced that tariffs on India would be reduced to 18 percent from 50 percent. Economists, as reported by Moneycontrol, estimate that the US trade deal alone could add 20–30 basis points to India’s GDP growth.\n\nTaken together, the pickup in services and manufacturing activity suggests that India has entered the new year with solid economic momentum, supported by easing trade frictions and improving global demand conditions.",

From a 12-hour operation, NMIA is moving to a 24-hour operation. International flights are scheduled to commence in the June quarter of 2027 from the greenfield airport.\n\nThe next phase of development will include a second runway and terminal, with enhanced passenger and cargo handling capacities that will position NMIA as a key aviation hub of western India.\n\nWhile Phase 1 includes a terminal and a runway with a capacity to handle 20 million passengers, Phase 2 will up the capacity to 60-65 million, with the addition of the second runway and terminal.\n\nThe company is targeting a 2029-30 deadline to complete the second phase, which will also involve the deployment of automated people movers (APMs) connecting T1 and T2 and the metro.\n\nConnectivity and strategic investments\n\nAir India Express, IndiGo, Akasa Air, SpiceJet and Star Air have started domestic flight operations from NMIA.\n\nAAHL has outlined ambitious investment plans for the next five years, with about Rs 1 lakh crore earmarked for airport expansion projects across its portfolio, including the Navi Mumbai airport, as it lays the groundwork for growth and prepares for either a demerger or a potential IPO between 2027 and 2030.\n\nNMIA is the eighth airport of AAHL and its first greenfield airport. In Q3FY26, AAHL saw no growth in passenger movement, which remained unchanged at 24.7 million, while air traffic movement dipped by 1 percent to 159,000. The company attributed the drop to IndiGo flight disruptions in early December.\n\nIn the December quarter, AAHL clocked a 57 percent year-on-year growth in stand-alone net profit at Rs 542 crore.

The sell-off sparked heightened volatility across the crypto market, with Bitcoin sliding to its lowest level since Donald Trump returned to the White House just over a year ago.\n\nBitcoin is finding it difficult to hold on to its place among the world’s top-10 most valuable assets by market capitalisation. Data from companiesmarketcap.com shows the cryptocurrency has slipped to the 12th spot, with a market value of about $1.524 trillion.\n\n“Bitcoin’s brief move below the $73,000 mark, its lowest level since November 2024, reflects heavy selling pressure as markets react to sustained uncertainty. The inability to sustain levels in the $77,000–$80,000 range has led to a cautious phase, with prices now testing important demand areas around the $75,000 zone,\" said Avinash Shekhar, Co-Founder & CEO, Pi42.\n\nAccording to the analyst, the decline does not appear to be driven by a single catalyst but rather a combination of positioning resets and broader market nervousness.\n\nCiting derivatives data, Shekhar said, liquidation pressure remains a near-term overhang, yet prices are still holding above longer-term structural supports. \"If this zone stabilises, the market may look to consolidate before attempting a recovery, though volatility is likely to persist until clearer macro signals emerge.”\n\nOther cryptocurrencies were volatile, too.

        "full_content": "For generations, property ownership for Indians has been closely associated with permanence, a home anchored in family, memory and long-term belonging. That lens, however, is shifting. Today, real estate decisions are increasingly shaped by financial logic, where returns, transparency and exit flexibility are beginning to matter as much as emotional value.\n\nThis change has sharpened comparisons between domestic real estate and global markets, with Dubai steadily emerging as a serious investment contender. The growing flow of Indian capital into the emirate reflects not aspiration but a measured reassessment of risk, return and reliability.\n\nIndian capital flows into Dubai gather momentum\n\nIndian participation in Dubai’s property market has gained momentum. According to the Betterhomes Residential Market report, Indians have consistently featured among the top three foreign nationalities buying real estate in the emirate, alongside British and Russian investors. More tellingly, their share of transactions has risen sharply in a relatively short span.\n\n\"In 2023, Indian buyers accounted for about 12 percent of foreign property transactions in Dubai, translating into investments of roughly AED 15.9 billion. Just a year later, that share had nearly doubled to around 22 percent, with Indian capital flows estimated at about AED 35 billion. The momentum has carried into 2025 as well, with Indians accounting for close to 23 percent of foreign transactions in the first half of the year, even as overall market activity remained robust,\" said Sankey Prasad, chairman, Colliers Project Leaders–Middle East.\n\nThis surge is unfolding against a broader upswing in Dubai’s real estate market. According to data shared by Squareyards, in the third quarter of 2025 alone, the city recorded more than 50,000 residential transactions, about 20 percent higher than a year earlier. Transaction values climbed nearly 12 percent to around AED 95.6 billion, pointing to sustained demand across price points and locations.\n\nWhy Dubai appeals to Indian investors\n\nDubai’s core attraction lies in the predictability of its real estate ecosystem. The absence of taxes significantly improves long-term net returns.\n\nAccording to Square Yards co-founder and chief business officer Anupam Rastogi, “Beyond financial metrics, Dubai offers currency diversification, political stability and residency-linked investment pathways. World-class infrastructure, global connectivity and a strong institutional tenant base position real estate as both an investment asset and a long-term lifestyle hedge for families with international exposure.”\n\nRental yields are another factor. Average gross yields of 7–9 percent compare favourably with major Indian cities, where yields are often in the 2–4 percent range. Freehold ownership structures and transparent title systems further strengthen investor confidence.\n\n“Real estate in Indian cities has its own set of challenges. They are delayed project completion, lack of transparency in pricing, hostile and frequently changing regulations, the legal system taking a long time to solve disputes, inconsistent enforcement of RERA and high costs involved with stamp duties and registration,”  RPS Group director Aman Gupta said.\n\nBeyond pure returns, residency-linked incentives enhance the investment case. Property investments of AED 2 million (around Rs 4.6 crore) make buyers eligible for a 10-year renewable Golden Visa, allowing them and their families to live, work and operate businesses in the UAE.\n\nAffordability remains a key anchor\n\nEqually notable is the changing profile of Indian buyers. With the average ticket size estimated at Rs 4–4.5 crore, Dubai real estate is no longer the preserve of ultra-high-net-worth individuals. Senior professionals, entrepreneurs and mid-sized business owners are now increasingly active, signalling a shift towards treating overseas property not as a niche or aspirational purchase but as a mainstream investment within a diversified portfolio.\n\nData shared by Squareyards shows that nearly 73 percent of all homes sold in Dubai were priced below AED 2 million. About 29.5 percent of these transactions were below AED 1 million, while 43 percent fell in the AED 1–2 million bracket. This affordability supports liquidity and makes portfolio-sized investments more feasible for Indian buyers.\n\nOn a price-per-square-foot basis, Dubai residential real estate typically ranges between the equivalent of Rs 26,000 and Rs 44,000, depending on location and project quality. While this is higher than city-wide averages in Indian metro- Mumbai at around Rs 13,250 and Bengaluru between Rs 10,000 and Rs 25,000, it comes with materially higher rental yields.\n\nA more global approach to property investing\n\nFor many Indian investors, the decision is no longer binary. Dubai offers globally competitive yields, tax efficiency and diversification, while India provides long-term growth driven by domestic demand. Together, they are increasingly being treated as complementary pillars within a diversified real estate portfolio.\n\nThe growing interest in Dubai does not imply an exit from Indian real estate. \"It is not an either or decision. Indian luxury housing continues to attract high-net-worth individuals, particularly for self-use and long-term holdings. Investors with business interests or family members based in the UAE, however, see clear logic in establishing a residential and investment presence there,\" said Morgan Owen, managing director–Middle East & North Africa at ANAROCK Group.\n\nThe January-June 2025 period saw the luxury housing market in India growg by a staggering 85 percent YoY, with nearly 7,000 units sold across the top seven cities — Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Chennai, a Lodha Group report released in October said.\n\n“For Indian investors, the trend is not about exiting India but about complementing domestic holdings with exposure to a transparent, income generative and internationally aligned real estate ecosystem,” Rastogi said. India and Dubai serve different investment objectives, together, they increasingly form two pillars of a globally diversified Indian real estate portfolio.\n\nDubai real estate is not without risks. Concerns around oversupply and market cycles remain, particularly in certain locations and segments. Regulatory shifts, while currently investor-friendly, can influence demand over time. Investors must also ensure strict compliance with India’s Liberalised Remittance Scheme to avoid legal and financial complications.\n\n\"Oversupply concerns have been noted, with ratings agencies forecasting potential price corrections of up to double digits amid rising deliveries, even after significant price growth. Sustained price increases over the last decade raise questions about cyclical peaks and exit liquidity may vary by location and segment,\" said Prasad.\n\nFor Indian investors, the appeal of Dubai lies less in novelty and more in numbers predictable income, policy clarity and portfolio balance in an increasingly global investment landscape. Expectations of liquidity should be aligned with market cycles and asset quality, Prasad said.",

Technically, Gold has immediate support near Rs 1,45,000, while resistance is seen around Rs 1,55,000.\n\nThe Augmont Bullion report, published on February 3, noted that gold has rebounded nearly 10 percent from recent lows as markets factor in the absence of key US economic data due to a partial government shutdown and renewed bargain hunting. The shutdown began after Congress failed to fund the Labour Department and other agencies, adding short-term uncertainty.\n\nMeanwhile, the US–India trade deal has supported the Indian rupee, with USD/INR appreciating toward 90.20, up nearly 1 percent. While tariff cuts to 18 percent improve trade relations, reduced uncertainty and a stronger rupee may temporarily cap domestic gold and silver prices by easing safe-haven demand and lowering import costs, despite supportive long-term fundamentals.\n\nThe report predicts that gold prices may extend the ongoing rebound toward $5,000 (Rs 1,55,000), with strong support seen near $4,600 (Rs 1,39,000).\n\nGold prices vary by purity.

        "full_content": "Fresh off concluding its long-pending Free Trade Agreement with the European Union on January 27, New Delhi received a second, strategic boost on February 2, when the United States recalibrated trade terms in what observers hailed as “the biggest victory for US-India relations in nearly a year.”\n\nTogether, these back-to-back breakthroughs effectively bookend India’s economic engagement with the West, positioning the country as a leading alternative in the global “China Plus One” strategy.\n\nNegotiations with the EU, formally relaunched in 2022, moved at a brisk pace to deliver what was quickly dubbed the “Mother of All Deals.”\n\nSimultaneously, the agreement with the US, driven by President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, reversed a year of high-tariff friction. By any measure, this dual-track success is consequential. Yet trade history offers a familiar reminder: the day after the deal is often far more complex than the celebration that precedes it.\n\nDynamic Protectionism:Look beyond tariffs\n\nThe post-deal world is increasingly shaped by dynamic protectionism, where trade is restricted not by tariffs but through non-tariff barriers and the strategic use of courts, parliaments, and sub-national politics to slow or reshape commitments signed. While tariffs may be zero on paper, domestic bureaucracies deploy hyper-specific safety standards, unique labelling requirements, and phytosanitary rules to block imports that are technically “duty-free.”\n\nYet, when these subtle bureaucratic hurdles aren't enough, governments are increasingly willing to discard the free trade playbook altogether in favour of raw political leverage. The US provides a blunt illustration.\n\nOn January, 2026, Washington announced a 25% tariff on advanced computing chips and automobiles. South Korea argues that its FTA protections apply. The U.S. counters that “national security” under Section 232 overrides any trade deal. The Korean trade minister has reportedly been shuttling between Washington offices ever since.\n\nFor India, the implication is unavoidable, there is no such thing as guaranteed post-deal tariffs.No such thing as a “free deal”\n\nThe deals made by other Asian partners also serve as a warning that preferential access is never \"free.\" Japan and Vietnam offer cautionary contrasts. Tokyo’s July 2025 agreement, trading a 15 per cent tariff cap for a $550 billion investment commitment in U.S. energy, AI, and semiconductor sectors, has ignited domestic backlash over capital flight and the loss of economic autonomy.\n\nVietnam, meanwhile, faces a 40 per cent U.S. tariff on suspected transhipped goods, forcing a costly overhaul of customs and origin-tracking systems to prove exports are genuinely “Made in Vietnam.” Washington’s decision to lower tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent has narrowed Vietnam’s competitive edge, proving that in modern trade diplomacy, preferential access is provisional, closely policed, and constantly contested.\n\nThe FTA’s full legal enforce remains contingent on ratification by the European Parliament and all 27 EU member states. In this provisional phase, EU trade policy enters a fragile middle ground- one that must still navigate Brussels’ notoriously politically charged bureaucracy.\n\nDespite the recent signing of the EU–Mercosur FTA on January 17, 2026, political contest began almost immediately. Within weeks, the European Parliament narrowly voted to refer the deal to the European Court of Justice, after intense lobbying and farmer protests framed as “cars for cows”, opposing cheaper Mercosur beef and poultry in return for expanded EU automobile exports. While provisional application may proceed, ratification is on hold pending judicial review, leaving Mercosur trapped in a political loop disguised as a legal process.\n\nEurope’s political arena is the battleground for non-tariff barriers\n\nThe 2016 EU–Canada CETA agreement offers a cautionary parallel, it was nearly derailed by the regional Parliament of Wallonia, Belgium, over farm and labour issues. India’s FTA will face a comparable gauntlet. While the EU as a whole may welcome greater access to India’s labour-intensive exports, regional politics will complicate ratification.\n\nAgriculture, climate, and labour standards will emerge as pressure points, not at the negotiating table, but across Europe’s domestic political arenas.\n\nThe EU–China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) offers the sharpest warning. After seven years and 35 rounds of negotiations, the CAI was concluded in late 2020, only to slide quietly into political limbo. Sanctions, parliamentary resistance, and shifting geopolitics have turned it into what many now describe as a “zombie agreement”, technically alive, but functionally inert.\n\nThe post-deal phase is often one of administrative trench warfare, endless committee meetings, clarifications, and vigilance to ensure commitments survive domestic politics. Success will depend on how India manages the issues set aside in the rush to conclude, like navigating  EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which can prove to be a double-tax that could erode the FTA’s benefits, for Indian exporters in carbon-intensive sectors like steel and engineering.\n\nUltimately, the convergence of EU and U.S. agreements reflects a growing confidence in India’s economic credibility and strategic centrality at a moment of global realignment. The real test now lies in disciplined follow-through, navigating regulatory frictions, defending market access, and converting diplomatic momentum into durable commercial outcomes. In trade, the day after the deal is the true starting point.\n\n(Anuj Guptais the India MD of policy consulting firm BowerGroupAsia.)\n\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "The FY27 Budget has drawn mixed reactions from markets and economists alike. While the government’s commitment to fiscal discipline—amid the pivot to a debt-to-GDP anchor through FY31—has been widely lauded, the headline numbers mask a complex landscape marked by immediate headwinds, including bond market jitteriness, potential revenue slippages, and a nuanced fiscal tug-of-war with state governments.\n\nFiscal prudence and the debt-targeting pivot: The most significant structural takeaway from the budget is the government's continued success in reining in the fiscal deficit. The Centre remains on track to meet its revised deficit target of 4.4% of GDP for FY26 and has budgeted for a further consolidation to 4.3% of GDP for FY27.\n\nCrucially, the budget marked the first year of a strategic pivot: the government has officially shifted its fiscal anchor from deficit-based targeting to debt-to-GDP targeting. The explicit goal is now to reduce central government debt to 50% (±1%) of GDP by FY31. Based on the current trajectory of consolidation, the Centre appears well-positioned to meet this long-term objective, a move that theoretically should comfort credit rating agencies.\n\nPressure on G-Sec yields: Despite these robust consolidation numbers, the bond market remains on edge. The Centre’s gross borrowing figure of Rs 17.2 lakh crore for FY27 significantly exceeded market expectations, which were pegged between Rs 16.5 lakh crore and Rs 17 lakh crore. This elevated borrowing requirement coincides with a persisting slowdown in tax revenue, which is projected to grow at a modest 7% for the second consecutive year due to weak buoyancy and a contraction in GST collections.\n\nThese factors have kept the 10-year G-sec yield elevated at approximately 6.7%, a stark disconnect from the policy rates which have seen the repo rate cut by 125 basis points since February 2025. Market sentiment remains under pressure due to a pronounced supply overhang with pressure from high state borrowing needs, further exacerbated by the deferral of Indian bonds’ inclusion in the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index, which has postponed anticipated passive inflows. RBI might have to intervene with Open Market Operations (OMOs) to absorb the over-supply and aid monetary transmission.\n\nUnlocking Value:The Disinvestment Challenge\n\nWith tax revenues under pressure, the government is increasingly relying on non-tax revenues, which have risen to approximately 22% of total receipts. While dividends from the RBI and PSUs have provided reliable support, the disinvestment roadmap remains a bottleneck. The FY27 disinvestment target appears ambitious, especially considering the Centre achieved only 23% of such targets between FY20 and FY25.\n\nTo address this structural hurdle, the Economic Survey has recommended a bold reform: amending the Companies Act to redefine what constitutes a \"government company.\" The proposal suggests lowering the minimum sovereign holding threshold from the current 51% to 26%. This reform would allow the Centre to unlock significant value through offer-for-sale (OFS) transactions without resorting to full privatization, while still retaining effective control and the right to block special resolutions.\n\nThe budget presents a well-rounded capex plan. On-budget capex is projected to recover to 11.5% growth in FY27, with infrastructure sectors—roads, railways, and metros—continuing to command a substantial 50% share of the allocation. However, the clear push in this budget is toward the defence sector. After years of modest growth (8% CAGR between FY20-25), defence capex has seen a robust ~17.5% budgeted growth. This is coupled with a strategic mandate to procure approximately 75% of capital equipment from domestic companies, promising a higher economic multiplier effect.\n\nCapex Vs Populism Finally, the budget highlights the critical role of states in driving execution. States have maintained robust capex growth of ~15% CAGR (FY22–25), significantly outpacing the Centre’s absorption capacity. Recognizing this, the Centre has increased interest-free capexloansto states by ~29% YoY to Rs 2.26 lakh crore, which now constitutes one-fifth of the Centre's effective capex.\n\nHowever, this comes with a caveat. State borrowings remain elevated, largely to fund Rs 2.6 lakh crore in populist cash transfers. With the 16th Finance Commission deciding to retain the tax devolution ratio at 41% rather than increasing it, states may be forced to continue high market borrowings to balance development goals with populist demands.",

        "full_content": "The Union Budget for FY 2026-27 serves as a strategic blueprint for India’s transition into a developed nation (\"Viksit Bharat\") by 2047. By balancing a sustained capital outlay with disciplined fiscal targets, the government aims to strengthen macroeconomic stability while driving aggressive growth in infrastructure and manufacturing.\n\nThe \"Three Kartavyas\" Framework\n\nThe budget is structured around a \"Three Kartavyas\" (Duties) philosophy designed to drive comprehensive national development:\n\n1.Accelerate and Sustain Growth: Enhancing productivity and building resilience against global dynamics.\n\n2.Fulfilling Aspirations: Building citizens' capacity through education, skilling, and healthcare.\n\n3.Inclusive Participation: Ensuring resources reach every family and region\n\nFiscal Consolidation Continues\n\nThe government has maintained its steadfast path of fiscal consolidation, setting the fiscal deficit target at 4.3% of GDP for FY 2026-27, which marks further improvement from the estimate of 4.4% for FY26RE. The government is also working towards lowering its total debt as compared to the size of the economy. The goal is to bring this debt down to 50% of GDP by FY31. This year, they expect to make progress by reducing it to 55.6% vs 56.1% last year.\n\nTo support this comprehensive development framework, the budget outlines borrowing and expenditure plan for the upcoming fiscal year. The Gross Market Borrowing is estimated at Rs 17.2 lakh crore, while the Net Market Borrowing has been set at Rs 11.7 lakh crore. These figures underpin a total projected expenditure of Rs 53.5 lakh crore, up 7.7% compared to FY26RE of Rs 49.6 lakh crore. Net tax receipts are anticipated to reach Rs 28.7 lakh crore up from Rs 26.7 lakh crore in FY26RE. The 7.2% growth estimate for net tax collections in FY27 appears credible as it is even lower than the 10% increase in nominal GDP growth expected in FY27.\n\nIn the Union Budget 2026-27, the government has further accelerated its infrastructure-led growth strategy by increasing public capital expenditure (capex) to a record Rs 12.22 lakh crore for FY27. This represents an 11.5% increase over the previous year's revised estimates. Key drivers for this outlay include a significant Rs 2.8 lakh crore (10% up compared to previous year) allocation for Railways—supporting the development of seven new high-speed rail corridors—and Rs 2.9 lakh crore for Roads and Highways. Additionally, new financial frameworks like the Infrastructure Risk Guarantee Fund and dedicated REITs for recycling CPSE assets have been introduced to boost private developer confidence and sustain long-term investment momentum.\n\nThe total allocation for defence increased by ~5% to reach Rs 6 lakh crore. A significant portion of this budget is dedicated to the Capital Outlay on Defense Services head, which has been pegged at Rs 2.19 lakh crore. This represents a sharp 17.6% jump in modernization funds compared to the previous year.\n\nThe strategic focus of this expenditure is clearly defined by large-scale allocations for high-tech hardware. Specifically, the budget earmarks Rs 63,733 crore for the acquisition and maintenance of aircraft and aero engines, while Rs 25,023 crore has been allocated for the strengthening of the naval fleet and enhancing the operational readiness of the armed forces across air and maritime domains.\n\nWhile personal income tax slabs remained unchanged for FY 2026-27, the government has introduced reforms to simplify India's tax landscape, including a new Income Tax Act, 2025, which reduces sections from 819 to 536 for easier compliance. Key changes include slashing Tax Collected at Source on overseas remittances from 5–20% to a flat 2%, taxing share buyback proceeds as Capital Gains. The budget also provides a one-time 6-month window for small taxpayers and NRIs to disclose minor foreign assets without heavy penalties.\n\nCapital Markets and Sectoral Impacts\n\nFor investors, the budget introduced several critical changes that are likely to impact trading costs and capital flows:\n\n*STT on F&O:To curb excessive speculation, the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on Equity Futures was hiked to 0.05% (from 0.02%), and on Equity Options to 0.15% (from 0.1%) of the premium value.\n\n*NRI/PROI Investment: Individual investment limits for Persons Resident Outside India (PROI) in listed equities were doubled from 5% to 10%, with the aggregate cap per company raised to 24%.\n\n*Buyback Taxation: In a move favouring minority shareholders, buybacks will now be taxed as Capital Gains in the hands of the shareholder, while promoters face an additional buyback tax.\n\n*MAT Overhaul: Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) is proposed as a final tax with a reduced rate of 14% (down from 15%), with no further credit accumulation after April 1, 2026.\n\nThe budget had specific measures that will go a long way in improving India’s physical and technological Infrastructure\n\n*Semiconductors & Electronics Manufacturing: India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) 2.0 announced and allocation for electronic component manufacturing scheme increased from Rs 22,900 crore to Rs 40,000 crore.\n\n* Biopharma SHAKTI (Strategy for Healthcare Advancement through Knowledge, Technology and Innovation) announced, with an outlay of Rs 10,000 crore over the next 5 years to develop India as a global Biopharma manufacturing hub.\n\n*AI and Cloud: A tax holiday until 2047 was proposed for foreign companies providing global cloud services via Indian data centres.\n\n*High-Speed Rail: Seven new corridors were announced, including Mumbai-Pune, Pune-Hyderabad, and Delhi-Varanasi.\n\n*Inland Waterways: Plans to operationalise 20 new national waterways over five years and develop ship-repair ecosystems in Varanasi and Patna.\n\nThough the measures announced in Budget are unlikely to have meaningful impact on any sector in the near term, it makes a calculated shift from short-term populism to long-term nation-building. By anchoring the economy with a 4.3% fiscal deficit target for FY27 along with sustained investments in capital expenditure, the government has provided a predictable and stable environment for investors.\n\nThe budget math appears credible with modest estimates of tax receipts and expenditure. Ultimately, this budget reinforces India's trajectory as a resilient pillar of global economic growth. Overall, in our assessment, the budget is positive from medium to long term prospective.",

        "full_content": "Wondering whether you should transfer your existing home loan to another bank? Today’s Ask Wallet Wise explains why it makes sense to transfer the home loan to the new bank.\n\nShould I transfer my current homeloanto another bank, which is offering 0.4-0.5 precent lower interest rate on my remaining repayment balance? I have already paid close to 40 percent of my loan amount.\n\nIs it worth transferring the loan to another bank with a lower interest rate? What is the procedure? Will I get the treatment like that of a new borrower of the new bank? What are the pros and cons?\n\nExpert’s Advice: It is advisable to transfer your existing home loan to any other bank if it offers you a better deal in terms of interest rate. You will need to have a good track record of repayments of your EMI on the existing home loan to be able to get the offer from another bank to take over your existing home loan. There are no prepayment charges on the transfer of the floating-rate home loan.\n\nYou will have to consider the processing fees, which you may have to pay to the new lender when you transfer your home loan. It will be in the range of 0-0.50 percent of the loan amount. Processing fee covers charges, including the advocate's fee for property search, title investigation report, valuation report charges, stamp duty, which may be applied to prepare the home loan agreement or mortgage, etc. Some banks have waived the processing fee. It is a one-time fixed fee, in absolute terms, which can be negotiated up on during the agreement.\n\nSince only 40 percent of your home loan is repaid, prime facie, it makes sense to transfer the home loan to the bank offering better rates. You can compute the amount you can save after calculating the interest rate for the remaining balance tenure, adding the cost of transferring the home loan in terms of processing and prepayment charges.\n\nI feel that there may be a difference of 0.4-0.5 percent in the interest rate, so you should be able to recover the same within the next one or two years. This involves the modalities of handing over the property documents from your existing bank to the new bank. The existing lender typically provides a letter addressed to the new lender mentioning the list of original documents available with them as security, and also agreeing to release the documents within a certain number of days after full payment is received. The letter will also state an amount for which the loan will be treated as fully paid off.\n\nCheck with your existing lender whether they are willing to drop the rate for you on the remaining balance, which will save you a lot of hassles. If they are not agreeable or are not offering the rate you can get from the market, you should definitely move your existing home loan. Yes, you will get the same treatment as a new borrower.",

        "full_content": "India’s Union Budget for 2026 marks a turning point in policy thinking. Instead of leaning heavily on the government’s balance sheet to propel growth as has been the case through years of disruption and recovery the focus has now shifted to restoring fiscal normalcy while safeguarding economic momentum. The emphasis is no longer on headline stimulus, but on signalling macroeconomic discipline and long-term confidence, particularly for investors tracking India’s structural growth story.\n\nThis intent is clearly reflected in the fiscal framework. The fiscal deficit has been budgeted at around 4.3% of GDP, indicating continued commitment to consolidation without resorting to sharp tightening. Government borrowing has been moderated in relation to GDP, which should help ease pressure on bond yields.\n\nCrucially, the revenue strategy relies on tax buoyancy and deeper formalisation of the economy rather than any increase in tax rates. Capital expenditure remains on an upward trajectory in absolute terms, even as the pace of expansion moderates after the aggressive ramp-up of recent years.\n\nPolicy priorities, however, extend beyond fiscal arithmetic. Infrastructure continues to be a core pillar, but the approach has evolved from expansion to optimisation, with sharper focus on efficiency gains, logistics cost reduction and productivity enhancement.\n\nIndustrial policy is now more overtly strategic, recognising the growing importance of advanced manufacturing in a geopolitically fragmented world. At the same time, services which is India’s enduring growth engine receive clearer policy acknowledgement through initiatives centred on skills, employment and export competitiveness. Collectively, these measures underline a shift from short-term demand support to long-term capacity building.\n\nThe Budget also reflects a broader reorientation of the state’s role in the economy. Rather than acting as the principal driver of growth, the government appears intent on creating conditions that crowd in private investment and strengthen institutions. This implicitly accepts that growth in the near term may be more measured, but potentially more stable and resilient. It also signals a readiness to navigate short-term frictions as the economy transitions toward higher productivity sectors.\n\nFrom a market standpoint, the increase in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) was avoidable, as it risks conveying an unfavourable signal to capital markets; however, the actual impact on market behaviour is likely to be marginal.\n\nOver the medium to long term, the underlying economic rationale remains constructive. By lowering structural costs, deepening capital markets and embedding resilience into the growth framework, India improves its prospects of sustaining 6–7% real growth without repeated macroeconomic stress.\n\nThe 2026 Budget may not generate immediate excitement, but it sends a more meaningful message that India is moving beyond stimulus-driven expansion toward a model where competitiveness, efficiency and structure determine the quality of growth.",

        "full_content": "After successfully concluding the “mother of all trade deals” with the European Union, India has now reached a trade deal with the Trump administration that will allow its exporters to access the US market at an 18% import tariff.\n\nThe partial rollback of Trump’s tariffsbringsIndian exporters on par with — or even better than — regional competitors such as Bangladesh (20%), Indonesia (19%), Pakistan (19%), Vietnam (20%), and China (37%). It is therefore rightly welcomed by the country’s stock market, with the benchmark Sensex rising by more than 2,000 points.\n\nIt is not so much about India securing an 18% post-deal tariff — which is still higher than pre-Trump levels — after President Trump announced a reciprocal tariff of 25%, followed by another 25% penalty for buying Russian oil. Rather, the India–US trade deal reduces regulatory uncertainty and improves market sentiment, even if only temporarily. That, in itself, is a significant relief for India Inc.\n\nWhat’s behind Trump’s softening on India?\n\nSeveral explanations have been offered for the Trump administration’s decision to roll back tariffs on India and extend a relatively more accommodating trade arrangement than many other partners have received.At its core, however, the shift appears less about goodwill and more about a steady erosion of U.S. bargaining power.\n\nOne factor is the changing global trade landscape. The successful conclusion of long-pending trade negotiations between the EU and India, along with the EU–Mercosur agreement, signalled that major economies were increasingly willing to move forward without Washington. This coincided with growing strains between the U.S. and its traditional allies — visible in disputes ranging from Greenland to trade frictions with Canada, which is exploring deeper engagement with China. Together, these developments have weakened the credibility of U.S. pressure tactics. India’s refusal to concede quickly to American demands only reinforces this trend.\n\nAn additional constraint emerged on the domestic front. There loomed the possibility of adverse judicial rulings challenging the President’s authority to impose broad, discretionary import tariffs. Any such ruling would significantly undermine Trump’s leverage in trade negotiations, making compromise a more attractive option than continued escalation.\n\nIndia’s exporters didn’t compromise on price\n\nContrary to expectations, with a little support from the steadily weakening INR—as highlighted by the Economic Survey—Indian exporters of many labor-intensive products such as rice and shrimp didn’t cut prices and instead reduced volumes, asshownby research from the Kiel Institute of World Economy. Many others haveshiftedto other markets such as China, the European Union, and Vietnam, leaving American consumers to bear the burden of Trump’s tariffs.\n\nThe relatively lower-than-expected impact on Indian exports allowed the Indian government to adopt a patient wait-and-watch approach, which appears to have paid off, at least for now.\n\nWhat it means for lndian businesses?\n\nThe initial reaction of the country’s stock market suggests that investors view this as big positive news — and it indeed is. It brings relief at a difficult time when FPIs have been pulling out, especially after the Budget 2026 increased the STT (Securities Transaction Tax) amid a steadily weakening INR.\n\nAs expected, the major beneficiaries of India–US trade — much like its trade deal with the EU — would be labour-intensive sectors such as agriculture and food products, auto components, gems and jewellery, leather goods, and textiles in particular.\n\nHowever, one must not forget that the US–India trade deal largely restores the status quo for Indian textiles, as pre-Trump era import duties were already in the range of 18%.The key gain for textiles is the removal of competitive disadvantages vis-à-vis countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Vietnam.\n\nLong-standing domestic impediments to India’s textile sector — including lack of fibre neutrality and an inverted duty structure — remain unchanged. In addition, any strengthening of the INR against the US dollar following the deal could dilute gains for India’s labour-intensive exports. Moreover, even post-deal, tariffs on Indian textiles will remain at around 18%, compared to zero for the EU, making European markets relatively more attractive for Indian merchandise.\n\nThe trade deal will have little Impact on India’s top exports — notably electronics and mobile phones, pharmaceuticals, and refined petroleum products — as these were already exempt from the application of Trump’s 50% tariffs.\n\nTrade deals are always about give and take. But with President Trump, it is often unclear what — and how much — one may need to give in return. Expectations, therefore, should be tempered.\n\nAs perTrump’s tweet, India has agreed to stop buying Russian oil and to purchase American energy, agricultural, and technology products worth US$500 billion. In return for an 18% import duty, India is also expected to reduce its tariffs and non-tariff barriers significantly to allow freer entry of American products. However, based on the statements and tweets from US administration officials so far, it remains unclear whether this is a goods-only trade deal or a comprehensive agreement covering services, government procurement, and investment protection. That will ultimately determine the overall benefit and cost of the deal for India.\n\nDespite the initial stock market exuberance, it’s a costly trade deal in terms of what India needs to deliver. India’s farm sector is likely to be unhappy as it seems India has agreed to allow freer imports of American agricultural products such as corn and soybean. It’s not clear as yet if that also includes genetically modified crops or not. But the processors of ethanol and poultry feeds will benefit from freer and cheaper imports of American corn. It also remains uncertain as of now whether India has offered any concessions on dairy products — which would go beyond what New Delhi has so far offered to Australia, New Zealand, or the EU.\n\nDropping discounted Russian energy would be a difficult choice for India, given its long-standing commercial and strategic relationship with Moscow. However, renewed access to Venezuelan oil could partially mitigate the impact by offering an alternative source of discounted crude, even if it cannot fully replace Russian supplies.\n\nOverall, the deal does not bring India back to the pre-Trump trade environment. Yet, compared to the prospect of facing 50% tariffs, it represents a clear improvement — and that makes it broadly positive news for Indian businesses.\n\nRITESH KUMAR SINGH is a business economist and CEO, Indonomics Consulting Private Limited.

        "full_content": "The FY27 Union Budget arrives at a critical moment for India - a moment defined by reasonably strong domestic fundamentals, juxtaposed against a turbulent global macro environment. In this context, the Budget’s overarching message is one of credibility over theatrics, continuity over abrupt pivoting, and execution over experimentation. It neither delivers populist fireworks nor aggressive tightening. Instead, it signals that India intends to grow steadily, invest purposefully, and consolidate gradually — all while navigating fiscal constraints with discipline.\n\nThis year’s fiscal deficit target of 4.3% of GDP, only marginally lower than 4.4% in FY26, may look modest on headline reduction. The government opted for a measured 10 bps reduction, prioritising credibility over aggressive signalling. Simultaneously, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to ease to 55.6% in FY27, down from 56.1% in FY26, on track toward the stated glidepath toward ~50% by FY31.\n\nA Fiscal Architecture Built on Realistic Assumptions:\n\nThe budgeted gross market borrowing of Rs 17.2 trillion (up from Rs 15.4 trillion in FY26) is the most market sensitive number this year. It is high, and it will keep yields elevated in the short run. Net borrowing is pegged at Rs 11.7 trillion. Yet the revenue assumptions behind this borrowing are not stretched:\n\n* Gross tax revenue (GTR) is budgeted to grow 8% YoY in FY27.\n\n* Excluding compensation cess effects, GTR growth rises to 10.4% YoY, a number aligned with the projected 10% nominal GDP growth.\n\n* Dividends from RBI and PSU banks are budgeted at Rs 3.2 trillion, slightly above the Rs 3.1 trillion achieved previously.\n\nThe spending side reflects similar pragmatism. Total expenditure is budgeted at Rs 53.5 trillion, only modestly above FY26 levels, with revenue expenditure kept contained to preserve capex quality. This balancing act ensures the fiscal stance is neither stimulative nor contractionary.\n\nCapex: Stability at Scale, with Sectoral Priorities Sharpening:\n\nPublic capex remains the centrepiece of India’s growth strategy. The Budget allocates Rs  12.2 trillion of central capex for FY27, representing +11% YoY growth. When one includes grants to states, the broader “capex plus” envelope rises to Rs 17.0–17.1 trillion, marking a substantial 12% YoY increase versus FY26.\n\nKey ministry allocations underscore the sharpened focus: 1) Defence capex: +17% YoY, following a 16% rise last year 2) Railways: +11% YoY, particularly in rolling stock and civil works. 3) Roads & Highways: +8% YoY, with NHAI’s expenditure plan rising to Rs 1.87 trillion. 4) MNRE (Renewable Energy): +30% YoY, led by grid strengthening priorities 5) Power sector: +39% YoY, reflecting surging transmission and renewable investment needs.\n\nThe government is aggressively building the “backbone sectors” — defence, energy systems, railways, logistics, and digital infrastructure - sectors that underpin India’s long term competitiveness.\n\nDespite macro stability, the largest sentiment shock came from the steep hike in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on derivatives. Due to this, round trip options transaction cost rises significantly for futures and options.\n\nFor a market where derivatives account for the bulk of turnover, this is non trivial. It raises friction, compresses liquidity, and may reduce intraday participation, particularly from retail and high frequency segments. While the measure is philosophically aligned with discouraging excessive leverage, its timing — amid already weak sentiment and continuous FPI outflows — makes it a near term market headwind.\n\nHowever, the Budget offsets this somewhat by rationalising buyback taxation and offering new investment pathways for non resident investors, reinforcing that the government’s structural stance toward capital markets remains supportive.\n\nKey sectors impacted by the budget\n\nDefence ManufacturingWith defence capex up 17%, aerospace and equipment manufacturing benefit meaningfully. Companies aligned with naval expansion, aircraft systems, advanced electronics, and missile systems are direct beneficiaries. The sustained double digit momentum confirms defence as India’s most stable multi year industrial capex theme.\n\nPower sector allocations jumping 39% signal a serious push into grid upgrades, transmission corridors, and renewable integration.\n\n* Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) receive explicit support.\n\n* Customs duty exemptions on lithium ion cell manufacturing equipment and solar glass raw materials strengthen domestic competitiveness.\n\n* Carbon capture outlay: Rs 200 billion over five years.\n\nThe message is clear: India’s energy transition is entering its “infrastructure decade”.\n\nData Centres & Digital Infrastructure\n\nThe Budget introduces a 20 year tax exemption (till FY2047) for foreign companies procuring cloud services from certified India based data centres. This removes PE risk and materially incentivises global firms to host workloads in India.\n\nCoupled with rising power capacity and logistics improvements, India is positioning itself as a global compute hub — a high spillover theme benefiting utilities, REIT style data centre operators, and equipment providers.\n\nElectronics Manufacturing & Semiconductors\n\nISM 2.0 receives budgetary allocations of Rs 10 billion (separate from ISM 1.0’s Rs 80 billion).\n\nElectronics Component Manufacturing Scheme (ECMS) outlay jumps to Rs 400 billion from Rs 229 billion — a near 75% expansion.\n\nThis marks a deeper commitment to domestic supply chain localisation, moving beyond assembly into components, OSAT, fabs, and semiconductor materials.\n\nKey welfare schemes receive meaningful increases:\n\n* Rural employment outlay rises to Rs 1.3 trillion, up 42% from Rs 880 billion.\n\n* PMAY (rural + urban) allocations grow 36% YoY versus FY26 revised numbers.\n\nThese shifts, combined with relatively muted inflation, support the bottom of the pyramid demand environment — indirectly benefiting cement, building materials, and select consumer staples.\n\nThe Biopharma Shakti programme allocates Rs 100 billion over five years for upgrading NIPERs, clinical trial ecosystems, and global standard regulatory frameworks. Though FY27’s allocation is a modest Rs 5 billion, the initiative signals a pivot toward higher value innovation-led healthcare manufacturing.\n\nConclusion: A Budget That Favours Discipline, Execution, and Bottom-Up Investing\n\nIn summary, the FY27 Union Budget is deliberately understated yet strategically meaningful. It has credible fiscal consolidation, capex continuity, sharper sectoral prioritisation (defence, power, digital infrastructure) and policy clarity in sensitive areas (fuel taxes, incentives, localisation)\n\nWhile the STT hike creates immediate turbulence, it does not alter the broader economic momentum. For investors, the Budget reinforces India’s structural growth narrative — but also demands careful stock selection.\n\nUltimately, if execution on capex improves and global volatility moderates, this Budget can underpin a durable, broad-based earnings cycle.",

This brought relief to investors that the 11-month tariff overhang had lifted - slashing tariffs from 50% to 18% is straightforward in numbers, but many-faceted in its implications.\n\nThe rupee rallied to 90.29 on Tuesday – its best single-session gain since November 2022. Foreign investors, who had been systematically reducing exposure to the Indian market (over $22 billion in foreign outflows over the past year), are now reassessing. Combined with recent EU and UK trade agreements, this could trigger FPI inflows.\n\nLet me put the 50% to 18% tariff reduction in perspective. Every 1% tariff costs India roughly around $1 billion in exports and about 1,00,000 jobs. If the 50% tariff had continued for another year, India would have lost nearly $36-40 billion in exports and 2-4 million jobs. In short, this deal provides economic stability for millions of households.\n\nIn the stock market, Textiles lead the change – 28% of India's textile exports go to the US. At 18% tariffs, Indian manufacturers easily gain 1-3 percentage points over competitors. Companies like Gokaldas Exports and Welspun Living saw immediate gains. Engineering goods, gems and jewelry, pharmaceuticals, and specialty chemicals benefit similarly. This is basic margin arithmetic translating into competitive positioning.\n\nBut here's what investors miss:There have also been (admittedly somewhat hazy) references to India’s investments into the US, with potential talk of India committing to purchase ~$500 billion in US goods – energy, technology, agricultural products, over the next decade. A majority of global leaders in these sectors are largely US-listed companies. Whether semiconductors, defence, quantum computing, or AI infrastructure, leading players in these sectors trade on US exchanges, and they added $500 billion in fuzzy revenue forecasts. If you believe in these commitments (and similar commitments from EU, SE Asia, etc), following through, you should look at portfolio diversification through listed investments in these US sectors.\n\nThis deal came one week after India's EU agreement, covering 2 billion people and a quarter of global GDP. India is executing deliberate diversification – textbook risk management at the national level. As the US \"de-risks\" from China, India positions itself as a democratic long-term alternative with large consumption potential, while building relationships with the EU, UK, and UAE.\n\nThis is also the time to call out a longer-term strategic shift I see happening, which would give India more leverage in a future trade negotiation. It is time for Indian retail investors to become providers and owners of capital on US bourses – increasingly establishing a voice on the boards and committees in listed US blue chip companies – driving a closer India-US alignment not just through government dialogue but also through influence of the key private lobbies that drive US trade priorities.\n\nInvestment decisions are not about chasing a one-day or one-week rally – they’re about recognizing structural shifts. The combination of US and EU deals gives India unprecedented Western market access. Indian markets should benefit in the short term, though long term Indian portfolio appreciation is still dependent on earnings growth and moderating forward earnings multiples.\n\nSimilar to India’s trade portfolio, where diversification is a must, diversification is also a must for your personal investment portfolio.\n\nA 70:30 India:US portfolio allocation split provides home market familiarity plus access to AI infrastructure, defence technology, and quantum computing themes unavailable domestically. You can start with global ETFs if stock selection feels daunting. Focus on systematic investing, not timing. Most importantly, focus on fundamentals, not tips – whether investing in India or abroad. The India-US trade deal may or may not sustain a prolonged bull run. But the case for global diversification of your portfolio is one that keeps on getting stronger and stronger!\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "The Monetary Policy Committee’s (MPC’s) last scheduled review for FY2026 comes at the end of an incredibly eventful week. The Union Budget for FY2027 pencilled in marginal fiscal consolidation amid a healthy double-digit expansion in growth-supportive capex. However, the higher-than-expected gross issuance number for FY2027 pushed up G-sec yields further.\n\nSubsequently, the trade deal with the US was announced, lowering tariffs on India to 18% from 50%, which helped the rupee strengthen.The expected boost to the growth outlook is likely to cement the case for a pause in the February 2026 policy review, with new data series for CPI and GDP to be unveiled later in the month.\n\nNew inflation index will introduce changes\n\nInflation outcomes have remained benign over the last two months. The CPI inflation has expectedly inched up from the record low 0.3% in October 2025 to 0.7% in November 2025 and further to 1.3% in December 2025, amid a narrowing deflation in the food and beverages (F&B) segment. It averaged at 0.8% in Q3 FY2026, remaining below the lower bound of the MPC’s target range of 2%-6% for the second consecutive quarter.\n\nAs the favourable base dissipates, ICRA estimates the headline print to inch up further to ~2.3% in January 2026 and cross 3.0% by March 2026 and 4.0% thereafter by September 2026, while evolving largely in line with the MPC’s forecasted trajectory. However, these projections are based on the old CPI series (base year: 2012), and the upcoming data will be for the new CPI series (base year: 2024), which encompasses multiple changes including a larger item basket, new data sources and updated weights.\n\nIt’s difficult to estimate the magnitude of change with new index\n\nHow will these changes impact inflation readings? This is a difficult question to answer. For instance, the new all-India group wise weights available in the Expert Group Report on Comprehensive Updation of Consumer Price Index point to a significant fall in the weight of the F&B segment to 36.8% from the 45.9% currently.\n\nA back-of-the-envelope calculation using these would suggest that the peaks and troughs in food inflation prints would be narrower vis-à-vis the current series, which would also reflect in the headline print. However, jumping to such conclusions may be premature, as changes in item/sub-group weights within the F&B group would matter; for example, if the weight of vegetables, which is the most volatile sub-group within F&B, largely remains unchanged, then outcomes may remain unfavourable. Thus, it would be best to wait for the first data release for the new series, due on February 12, 2026.\n\nOctober-December quarter growth may taper\n\nOn the growth front, the year-on-year (YoY) performance of high frequency indicators was mixed in Q3 FY2026 relative to Q2. While ICRA pegs the GDP growth at a healthy 7.1-7.2% in Q3 FY2026, this is softer than the 8.0% seen in H1 FY2026, partly owing to an unfavourable base.\n\nMoreover, sharp YoY contraction in the GoI’s capital expenditure (-23.4%) as well as non-interest non-subsidy revenue spending (-9.1%) in Q3 FY2026 is likely to weigh on GDP growth in the quarter, even as buoyant festive demand aided by GST rate rationalisation may have supported private consumption.\n\nGDP base revision induces uncertainty in forecasts\n\nHere too, the change in the base year for the GDP series to 2022-23 from 2011-12, due at end-February 2026, would constrain the growth forecasts. The new dataset would also provide the updated data for the FY2024-2026 period, which may result in changes in quarterly/annual growth rates for this period, leading to a reassessment of past growth outcomes. This could also have a bearing on the near-term growth trajectory as well as expectations around potential growth.\n\nMPC may pause rate action even as it supports liquidity\n\nWith this data overhaul on the anvil, we believe that the MPC will likely abstain from tweaking its growth and inflation projections, which are based on the old series. In fact, apart from the positive cues on growth on account of the trade deal and the government’s budgeted capex hike, ICRA also believes it would be appropriate to maintain status quo on policy rates in the MPC meeting later this week to assess the new GDP and CPI data. These data series will determine the current growth-inflation mix, and aid in forming a fresh outlook.\n\nNevertheless, we expect the Reserve Bank of India to continue to focus on providing further liquidity support in the near term, through open market operations and term variable rate repos during February-March 2026. These, along with the Rs. 0.9 trillion buy-back pencilled in the Budget, would be important to provide some respite on the liquidity front, given the seasonal stress that is typically seen during this period. They may also help to cool bond yields from the current one-year high levels.\n\n(Aditi Nayaris Chief Economist, Head- Research & Outreach, ICRA.)\n\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

The new courses begin in March.\n\nThe initiative comes at a time when India is not only scaling up electronics manufacturing but also seeing rising demand for Apple products such as iPhones and MacBooks.\n\nUnder its global $50 million Supplier Employee Development Fund, Apple is rolling out expanded development courses across supplier sites, starting with Tata Electronics. By the end of 2026, Apple expects to offer over 100 training programmes at major manufacturing facilities in India.\n\nThe Bengaluru-based Apple Education Hub will initially support courses in digital literacy, Swift code, robotics, automation technology and smart manufacturing. Today, Apple and its partners offer more than 75 courses for supplier employees in India.\n\nGlobally, the fund has already benefited more than 18,000 supplier employees by providing employment and professional development opportunities across Apple’s supply chain.\n\n“Workers in every place where we manufacture are critically important to us. Expanding access to education gives everyone more ways to realize their potential. Here in India, skills are a key driver of economic opportunity, and we think that can be transformative,” Chandler said.\n\n“Fundamentally, we believe that you can't make the best products in the world without investing in the people who help make them.”\n\nThe executive said electronics manufacturing is witnessing tremendous growth across India. “That's exciting because it gives Apple an opportunity to deepen its support for the people who help make our products here,” she added.\n\nFollowing the initial success of its robotics training programme launched in December 2024, Apple plans to expand the offering to more sites this year. The programme trains and qualifies factory educators at robotic labs, who then customise curriculum and deliver sessions at their respective facilities.\n\n“We're very excited to see our suppliers and supplier employees in India embrace this wide range of courses and take control of their professional development and gain more opportunities…we really are working to continue to deepen our relationship with workers, and definitely to deepen our relationship with workers in India as we deepen our investment and support for people who help make our products here,” Chandler said.\n\nApple is also expanding its Vocational Education for Persons with Disabilities programme in India, recently launched with component manufacturing partner Salcomp. Around the world, Apple works with suppliers to provide programmes ranging from rights awareness training to technical, professional, health and community resilience education.\n\nAccording to Counterpoint Research, Apple exited 2025 calendar year with its highest-ever smartphone market share in India at 9 percent by volume and 28 percent by value. The iPhone 16 was the top-shipped model in India in 2025.\n\nWith an expanding retail footprint, local manufacturing push and rising premiumisation in the market, Apple appears to be positioning India not just as a production hub but as a long-term demand driver through 2027 and beyond.\n\nAsked about India’s growing appetite for Apple devices, Chandler said, “We love our customers in India, and across everything we do, we want people to remain at the center of Apple's growth in India — from supplier employees to partners on our retail team. We will continue to invest in skills, well-being, and opportunity, supporting sustainable long-term growth here.”",

But I know for sure, that you loved being at Zomato, and it is quite possible that you never felt like home anywhere else since you left,” he said.\n\nGoyal revealed that Eternal already has over 400 employees who are on their second or third stints with the company. “Many of them are doing their best work now. Maybe because they’ve grown, but also because the company has grown. We are more organised, a little less chaotic, and hopefully, I’ve learned a few things along the way too,” he added.\n\nIf you used to work at Zomato, whether you chose to move on, or I was the one who asked you to leave, this is for you. I know that for many of you, Zomato didn't have the environment, or the leadership you needed at the time. But I know for sure, that you loved being at Zomato,…\n\n— Deepinder Goyal (@deepigoyal)February 3, 2026\n\nSeeking to dispel fears of closed doors or lingering grudges, Goyal said, “If you haven’t reached out because you think the door is closed, or because you think I’m holding onto the past, I’m not. I want you back.”\n\nHighlighting the scale of opportunities at Eternal, Goyal pointed to its expanded portfolio that now includes Zomato, Blinkit Quick-Commerce, Blinkit Ambulances, District, Hyperpure, Nugget, and Feeding India. “We need people who already know what good looks like here, and who care enough to fight for it. There is no better person for that than someone who has been here, left, grown, and wants to come back,” he wrote.\n\nAddressing concerns around his transition from the CEO role, Goyal played down its significance. “You might say that Eternal is not going to be the same, because I am not the CEO anymore. But ask yourself a question. Did titles ever matter at Eternal? I am still very much here, and I’d love for you to be a part of this next phase of Eternal,” he said.",

        "full_content": "We just got the mother of all trade deals with the EU, a diplomatic and commercial milestone that reset India’s engagement with one of its most important bilateral trading partners. And almost on cue, the real OG arrived. The India–US trade deal announced on February 2 has quietly done something even bigger: it has repositioned India on the global trade chessboard.\n\nFollowing a call between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi, the US cut tariffs on Indian goods to 18%, down from levels that had crept up to nearly 50% in some categories. In exchange, India committed to lowering tariffs and non-tariff barriers on US goods, stepping away from Russian oil, and purchasing over $500 billion of American energy, technology, agriculture, coal and industrial products over time.\n\nOn the surface, it reads like a typical Trump-era headline deal. Underneath, it is a structural shift and India is the clear economic beneficiary, although with T&C (terms and conditions).\n\nThe most important number here is 18%. That tariff rate places India below virtually every competing emerging market exporter. China still faces around 34%, Bangladesh 20%, Pakistan 19%. In global supply chains, that difference is not cosmetic, it directly changes sourcing decisions. For the first time in decades, India becomes the lowest-tariff large manufacturing platform selling into the world’s biggest consumer market.\n\nThis matters most for labour-intensive exports- textiles, apparel, footwear, gems and jewellery, and engineering goods. These sectors operate on thin margins and depend heavily on the US. A few percentage points of tariff relief can mean the difference between winning and losing large retail contracts. Textiles, in particular, stand out. The US absorbs nearly one-fourth of India’s textile exports and is also a major cotton supplier.\n\nAgainst competitors like Bangladesh and Vietnam, India has always been slightly more expensive. The tariff cut narrows that gap sharply, making Indian exporters far more attractive to mid-priced US retailers who care about cost, compliance and supply-chain resilience in equal measure. This is particularly good for a sector which has been miserable for quite some time now.\n\nAuto components are another underappreciated winner. The US accounts for roughly 25–30% of export revenues for Indian auto-parts makers. Tariffs falling from 50% to 18% materially improve India’s cost competitiveness in global OEM supply chains. Finished vehicle exports remain small, but in the component business where India already has scale- this deal locks in deeper integration.\n\nChemicals, pharmaceuticals, and electronics also benefit as lower barriers accelerate the China+1 shift. When US firms rethink where they source from, tariff arbitrage matters. India just moved to the front of that queue.\n\nThe US, of course, gains too. Energy exporters, LNG suppliers, agricultural producers and tech firms get a guaranteed growth market. Strategically, Washington scores by nudging India away from Russian oil. Politically, President Trump gets a fast, high-impact trade win. But in pure economic terms, India has secured the prize that matters most: privileged access without surrendering politically sensitive sectors like dairy or small-farm agriculture- at least for now.\n\nThat asymmetry is why markets reacted the way they did. Textiles, banks, IT and capital goods led the move. The rupee strengthened. With valuations already corrected and a fiscally disciplined budget in place, this deal acts as a magnet for foreign capital.\n\nFrom a fund manager’s lens, this is more than a one-day rally. It is a repricing of India’s role in global portfolios. In a world where geopolitics increasingly drives capital flows, India now sits in the sweet spot: large, stable, fast-growing and now, the most tariff-advantaged emerging market into the US.\n\nThe details will come, and yes, the devil will be there. But markets don’t wait for fine print. They price inflection points. And February 2 may well be remembered as the day India quietly moved from being a participant in global trade to being one of its primary beneficiaries.",

        "full_content": "President Donald Trump announced on February 2, after a call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, that the United States and India had agreed to a trade understanding reducing US reciprocal tariffs on Indian goods from 25% to 18% with immediate effect. The move signals a meaningful effort to stabilise and strengthen one of the world’s most important economic relationships. While many operational details will be clarified over time, the direction of the agreement is constructive: lower trade friction, expanded market access, and deeper cooperation in energy and strategic sectors.\n\nThe tariff reduction is an immediate positive for Indian exporters, particularly in textiles, engineering goods, pharmaceuticals, and electronics — sectors that depend heavily on access to the US market. Lower duties improve price competitiveness and provide greater certainty for businesses planning production and investment.\n\nUS statements also suggest that India may expand purchases of American goods across energy, technology, agriculture, coal, defence equipment, and manufacturing. Estimates have referenced potential purchases of up to $500 billion over time, though the pace and structure of these commitments will become clearer as negotiations progress.\n\nWith the recent FTA with the European Union and the new trade understanding with the United States, India’s strategy to produce more, export more, and compete globally is becoming clearer — reinforced by Budget 2026’s focus on expanding domestic capacity and industrial capability.\n\nThis development builds on an already solid trade foundation. In FY25, bilateral trade between India and the US was about $132 billion, making the US one of India’s largest trading partners. India maintains a goods trade surplus with the US, driven by exports of pharmaceuticals, engineering products, electronics, gems and jewellery, and textiles. Improved tariff conditions can further strengthen these flows and support employment and industrial growth.\n\nFor the US, India represents a rapidly expanding market for high-value goods and services, including energy products, aircraft, technology solutions, and advanced manufacturing inputs. A calibrated increase in Indian imports from the US would help balance trade while deepening supply-chain integration.\n\nEnergy at the Centre of the Shift\n\nEnergy cooperation is likely to be a central pillar of the evolving partnership. India is the world’s third-largest crude oil importer, bringing in roughly 4.8 million barrels per day of crude in recent years. Oil imports form a significant part of India’s merchandise import bill.\n\nIn FY25, Russia accounted for around 30–40% of India’s crude oil imports, reflecting the availability of discounted supplies. This helped refiners manage costs and supported domestic fuel stability but also added a geopolitical dimension to trade discussions. India has already begun diversifying sources, with US crude exports to India rising in 2025 alongside continued supplies from the Middle East.\n\nA gradual increase in US energy imports would not only reshape trade flows but also broaden India’s energy sourcing strategy.\n\nComplementing India’s Structural Economic Reforms\n\nThe Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the European Union earlier this year, along with the recent trade understanding with the United States, aligns closely with India’s broader economic strategy. In line with this, the latest Union Budget reflects greater emphasis on strengthening the supply side of the economy. Policy focus now includes:\n\n* Expanding manufacturing capacity in semiconductors, electronics components, and capital goods\n\n* Improving infrastructure and logistics efficiency\n\n* Supporting MSMEs to scale operations\n\n* Incentivising production, exports, and domestic capacity creation\n\nThe overarching objective is clear: India aims to produce more, export more, and compete more effectively in global markets.\n\nCurrency, Capital Flows and Market Impact\n\nA more stable trade relationship with the US carries macro-financial benefits. Stronger export visibility and higher trade in capital goods and energy can support INR stability against the USD by improving India’s external balance. Greater policy clarity and closer strategic ties may also strengthen foreign investor confidence.\n\nIf export growth combines with supply-side reforms, it could revive private sector capital expenditure. Higher capex supports job creation, credit expansion, and corporate earnings — constructive signals for markets over the medium term.\n\nA Positive Direction, With More to Learn\n\nOverall, the tone and direction of the India–US trade understanding are positive. Lower tariffs, broader market access, and deeper energy cooperation support growth and long-term alignment. While the detailed terms are still being worked out, the announcement signals a constructive reset in economic relations, consistent with India’s push toward a stronger, production-led growth model.",

        "full_content": "The India-US bilateral trade agreement (BTA) announced last night by US President Donald Trump and confirmed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi immediately sent the GIFT Nifty on an upward trajectory. The immediate positive sentiment is understandable. This deal was more than a year in the making. The US imposed tariffs of 50% on Indian products were hurting exports to the US. Beyond this the US tilt towards Pakistan during and after Operation Sindoor muddied the evolving strategic partnership between India and US.\n\nThe negative sentiment added to some FIIs taking a negative view. FIIs also had other reasons to exit, such as the Yen carry trade unwinding, finding other markets at more attractive valuations or providing higher exposure to AI, among other reasons. The combined result of the tariffs hurting exports to the US and FII outflows caused the INR to drop against the USD even a global currency market where USD was falling against other major currencies.\n\nBefore going deeper on the impact of this deal for the future, let us look at some hard data.\n\nUS-India goods trade in 2024 was $129 billion with Indian exports to the US at $87 billion and US exports to India at $42 billon. In addition, the US-India services trade in 2024 was $83 billion with both exporting around $41.5 billion to each other.\n\nPut together, goods and services trade between India and US is already $212 billion with India importing $83 billion worth of goods and services from the US.\n\nSo far the only information available is the tweet by President Trump. It states that India will stop buying Russian oil and buy oil from the US and Venezuela. This, of course, depends on the relative prices of oil from various sources. Some quantum of buying is definitely possible. If not in oil, then possibly LNG, etc.\n\nThe tariff will immediately go down from 50% to 18%. This doesn’t sound that great. However, if we compare with other major countries, this is very favourable. China is at 30% tariffs and even Canada and Mexico face 25%-35% tariffs for certain goods. EU has struck a trade deal with 15% tariffs. The 18% tariff on Indian goods sounds quite comparable to the EU deal.\n\nAccording to Trump’s tweet, India will move forward to reduce the tariffs on American goods to zero. This can be interpreted as a multi-year, probably 5-year, plan to reduce the tariffs in multiple steps to zero.\n\nThe tweet further says that India will buy $500 billion of American goods and services. This is likely over the next 3-5 years. Based on the earlier discussion we are already “Buying American” worth $83 billion, including both goods and services. Taking this to $100 billion is not a tall task.\n\nThe areas mentioned in the tweet are:\n\n•Energy: This means oil and gas, but could also include nuclear, solar and other clean energy technologies, including battery related. Also coal was mentioned. Clue is to look at some of the provisions in the budget.\n\n•Technology: This is related to AI, data center technology, including power generation for data centers, and possibly nuclear technology. Again some clues can be gathered from provisions in the budget.\n\n•Agricultural: Here, most likely, it means high-end niche products which do not impact the India farmer. For a clue to this one has to look at the exclusions in the India-New Zealand and India-EU FTA. It allowed agricultural products but several segments of agriculture and dairy were completely ruled out in both cases. The same segments will continue being ruled out in the India-US deal to protect the Indian farmer.\n\nTo understand the framework of the deal one has to look for clues in the budget and also the other two prominent trade deals concluded recently, viz. the India-EU and the India-New Zealand. Also notice the absence of mention of Defence equipment.\n\nBased on the budget, it is likely that India will be positioned as a data center hub for American companies to support the rest of Asia. This will probably involve joint ventures and lots of FDI in India.\n\nAlso, while not mentioned at all, rare earth mining, processing and supply chain from India to the US is likely part of the deal, based on the budget provisions. This would involve buying technology and FDI from the US.\n\nThe US-India BTA is a significant positive trigger for, both, the Indian stock markets as well as the currency. This should act as an inflection point for the Indian stock market where the Indian economy was doing extremely well compared to any other major economy but the market continued struggling. FII sentiment should become positive from a medium-term perspective. Similarly, the USD-INR should stabilize at below 90. As more details emerge the impact on different sectors should be visible.\n\nOverall, the start of a new era for the Indian economy with trade deals with the two largest trading regions in the world, viz., US and EU.",

        "full_content": "Selling agricultural land and reinvesting the proceeds may appear like a clear path to saving capital gains tax, but a small legal misstep can prove costly. Recently, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), Delhi, rejected a husband’s claim for capital gains tax exemption after ruling that the benefit cannot be availed when the sale proceeds from agricultural land are reinvested in property purchased in the wife’s name.\n\nThe ITAT Delhi’s January 2026 ruling clarifies that Section 54B is available only to the assessee, and the new agricultural land must be purchased strictly in the name of the assessee. “Purchasing the new agricultural land, using the proceeds from the sale of the original agricultural land, in the name of the spouse or any other person will disqualify the exemption, even if the entire sale proceeds are funded by the assessee,” said Madhura Samant, Managing Partner, Elarra Law Offices.\n\nSection 54B of the Income Tax Act allows individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) to claim an exemption on capital gains arising from the sale of urban agricultural land, provided the land was used for agricultural purposes. Since rural agricultural land is not considered a capital asset, it is outside the scope of section 54B.\n\nWhat are conditions to claim benefit under section 54B.\n\nThe agricultural land must have been used for farming purposes either by the individual taxpayer or by their parents.\n\nIn the case of a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), the land should have been used for agricultural activities by the family.\n\nThe land should be used for agricultural purposes for any period within 2 years from the date of transfer.\n\nThe case before the Delhi Bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) involved an assessee, Adel Saini, who had sold agricultural land jointly with his eight brothers and claimed exemption on capital gains under Section 54B of the Income Tax Act. The dispute is related to Assessment Years 2012–13 and 2013–14. The Assessing Officer reopened the assessment after finding that no capital gains had been declared despite the receipt of sale consideration from the transfer of urban agricultural land.\n\nFor AY 2012–13, the assessee had declared an income of Rs 3.2 lakh, while information available with the tax department showed that agricultural land was sold for Rs 5 crore. The assessee’s share in the sale proceeds was Rs 55.55 lakh. Although capital gains arose from the transaction, the assessee claimed exemption under Section 54B, stating that the gains were reinvested in the purchase of new agricultural land. However, the new land was purchased in the name of his wife and not in his own name.\n\nThe Assessing Officer denied the exemption on the ground that Section 54B requires the new agricultural land to be purchased by the assessee himself. This view was upheld by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), who relied on earlier judgments of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, which had clearly held that exemption under Section 54B is not available if the new land is purchased in the name of a spouse.\n\nWhen the matter reached the ITAT, the tribunal agreed with the lower authorities. It observed that the legal position on the issue was already settled by the Punjab and Haryana High Court in earlier cases, including Bahadur Singh, where a similar claim was rejected and even the Supreme Court had dismissed the special leave petition. Accordingly, the ITAT held that the assessee was not entitled to Section 54B exemption as the reinvestment was made in the wife’s name and dismissed the appeal for AY 2012–13.\n\n“We find no error in the order of Ld. CIT(A) in confirming the denial of deduction u/s 54B as the assessee had purchased the new agricultural land in the name of his wife and not in his own name. Accordingly, all the grounds of the appeal of the assessee are dismissed,” tribunal said.\n\nWhat does this ruling mean for a similar case?\n\nThis ruling serves as an important clarification for taxpayers seeking exemption under Section 54B of the Income Tax Act, which allows capital gains relief when agricultural land is sold and the proceeds are reinvested in new agricultural land. “The Tribunal has made it clear that the exemption is strictly assessee-specific. If the reinvestment is made in the name of a spouse or any other family member, the transaction may be treated as non-compliant, leading to denial of exemption even if the funds were entirely contributed by the assessee. Thus, for similar cases, this ruling reinforces that beneficial ownership or family arrangement is not enough; the legal title must align with statutory requirements,” said Soayib Qureshi, Partner, PSL Advocates & Solicitors.\n\nWhat should people keep in mind while doing such a transaction to avail tax benefit?\n\nThe purchase of new agricultural land must be completed on or before the due date for filing the income tax return of the following financial year. If the land cannot be purchased by this deadline, the taxpayer may deposit the eligible amount in the Capital Gains Account Scheme (CGAS) to continue claiming the exemption. However, if the newly acquired agricultural land is sold within three years from the date of purchase, the exemption allowed earlier will be revoked. “To claim exemption under Section 54B should ensure that the new agricultural land is purchased solely in their own name.\n\nJoint ownership or purchase in the name of a spouse or relative may jeopardise the claim,” said Bhavya Khaterja, Advocate, Legum Solis.\n\nIt is very important to make a clear decision before claiming tax benefit. “People planning similar transactions should carefully review the specific legal requirements of the exemption they intend to claim,” said Nikita Rathi, Advocate, Delhi High Court.",

But when you switch jobs, lose employment or face a financial crunch, the question you may ask is how much of your PF can you withdraw, and when?\n\nThe rules are actually clearer than you may think, but depend heavily on your how long you’ve been in service and your employment status.\n\nWhen can you withdraw your full PF balance?\n\nYou can withdraw all of your EPF balance once you retire at the age of 58. You are also allowed withdraw the full amount in case you are unemployed for two months after leaving your job. “Unemployed” in this case means you are not working in any establishment covered under EPF. If you do join a new employer and your UAN becomes active again, you are expected to transfer your balance instead of withdrawing it.\n\nAlso, in case you move abroad permanently for employment or settlement, you are allowed to withdraw your EPF balance in full even if you are below 58 years of age.\n\nThe 75 percent withdrawal rule after one month of unemployment\n\nMany people are not aware of this rule: If you lose your job and are unemployed for a month, you can withdraw up to 75 percent of your total EPF balance. The remaining needs to stay in the account.\n\nIf you continue to be unemployed for another month—or a total of two months—you can withdraw the remaining 25 percent.\n\nThis rule was introduced to allow people to access part of their savings in case they lose their jobs without completely draining their retirement savings. It also gives flexibility if you expect to join a new job soon and don’t want to close the account entirely.\n\nService period matters for tax\n\nWhether your PF withdrawal is tax-free or not depends on how long you have been in service on a continuous basis.\n\nIf you withdraw your EPF before completing five years of continuous service, the withdrawal is taxable. The employer’s contribution and interest earned may be taxed, and TDS may apply if the withdrawal exceeds the prescribed threshold.\n\nHowever, if you have been employed continuously for over five years and have transferred your PF each time, even across different employers, then your EPF withdrawal is generally tax-free.\n\nIf you have contributed to the Employees’ Pension Scheme for at least 10 years, you cannot withdraw the pension portion as a lump sum. Instead, you become eligible for a pension at 58.\n\nIf your service is less than 10 years and you leave employment, you can apply for withdrawal benefits from the pension component using the appropriate form.\n\nThis is often overlooked, and many employees assume the entire PF balance works the same way. It does not. The provident fund and pension portions have separate rules.\n\nShould you withdraw or transfer?\n\nFinancially, withdrawing PF during short unemployment may solve an immediate cash problem, but it comes at a cost. You lose the power of compounding and potentially disrupt long-term retirement planning.\n\nIf you expect to get another job soon, transferring the PF is usually the better option. Your UAN remains the same across employers, making transfers easier than before.\n\nPF is designed as retirement money. The withdrawal provisions are there for hardship, not convenience.\n\nBefore clicking the withdrawal button on the portal, understand what you are giving up.\n\n1. Can I withdraw PF while still employed?\n\nYou cannot withdraw the full PF balance while employed. However, there are special cases under which you can make partial withdrawal such as for medical emergencies, buying a home, higher education or marriage, subject to conditions and limits.\n\n2. Is PF withdrawal automatic after two months of unemployment?\n\nNo. You need to apply for a withdrawal through the EPFO portal. The account does not close automatically.\n\n3. Will I lose interest if I don’t withdraw after leaving my job?\n\nInterest continues to accrue for a certain period even after leaving employment, subject to EPFO rules. However, prolonged inactivity without updating employment details may cause administrative complications. It is usually better to either transfer or formally withdraw rather than leave it unattended for years.",

        "full_content": "For many retirees, their house is their biggest asset. It sits there quietly appreciating over the years, while monthly income may shrink after retirement. A reverse mortgage is designed for exactly this situation. It allows senior citizens to convert part of their home’s value into regular income without having to move out.\n\nWhat a reverse mortgage actually means\n\nIn a regular homeloan,you borrow money to buy a house and repay the bank every month. In a reverse mortgage, it goes something like this: you already own the house and the bank pays you.\n\nInstead of you paying an EMI, the bank gives you money either as monthly income, a lump sum, a line of credit, or a combination. The loan is secured against your home, but you continue to live in it.\n\nIn India, senior citizens above 60 years of age can avail reverse mortgages if for their self-owed, self-occupied residential property that has a clear title.\n\nThe bank will evaluate the value of your home and decide how much it will lend. This is usually a percentage of the property’s market value and depends on your age. The older you are, the higher the potential payout, because the expected loan tenure is shorter.\n\nPayments may be structured for a fixed period, often up to 15 or 20 years. Interest keeps getting added to the outstanding loan balance over time. Since you are not repaying during your lifetime, the total amount owed grows.\n\nYou are still responsible for maintaining the property, paying property taxes and keeping it insured.\n\nWhat happens after your lifetime\n\nIn a typical scenario, this type of loan needs to be repaid only after the death of the last surviving borrower or if the house is sold.\n\nIf that happens, your legal heirs have the choice of repaying the outstanding loan and keeping the property. If they opt not to do that, the bank can sell the property to recover its dues. If the sale proceeds exceed the loan amount, the\n\nexcess amount goes to the heirs. If the house sells for lesser, the bank generally cannot recover the shortfall from other assets.\n\nA reverse mortgage is a good option for retirees who own assets but their monthly income is poor. If most of your wealth is locked away in property and you need regular cash flow for living expenses or medical needs, it can provide relief without, say, forcing you to move into a smaller house.\n\nHowever, if leaving the house debt-free to your children is a major aim for you, you need to weigh that carefully. A reverse mortgage gradually eats into home equity.\n\nThings to think about before deciding\n\nInterest rates matter because the loan balance compounds over time. Also, payouts are often lower than people expect, especially in conservative valuations.\n\nTalk openly with family before signing up. Understand the terms fully. And compare it with alternatives such as renting part of the house, downsizing or using other retirement savings.\n\nA reverse mortgage is not a last resort, but it is not a casual decision either. Used thoughtfully, it can turn a silent asset into a steady retirement income.",

        "full_content": "Indus Towers will review shareholder payouts at the time of its Q4 results, with management indicating that improved clarity around Vodafone Idea’s AGR-related position and financial stability will factor into the board’s decision.\n\nAnalysts had earlier said that relief on adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues for Vodafone Idea would significantly benefit Indus Towers by improving visibility on the telecom operator’s ability to make timely vendor payments and resume network capex.\n\n“At the time of annual results at the end of Q4, the Board should look at performance and make a decision, and the Board is committed to distribution to the shareholders,” Managing Director and CEO Prachur Sah said during the Q3 earnings call.\n\nResponding to questions on whether anything is holding back the resumption of payouts, Sah said the earlier framework remains unchanged.\n\n“Everything will be considered. I don’t want to preempt the Board discussion right now, but everything would be considered, and the Board is committed to distribution to shareholders.”\n\nIndus Towers last declared a dividend in May 2022 — an interim payout of Rs 11 per share — and has not announced any distribution since. The company has deferred payouts for 12 straight quarters across FY23, FY24, FY25 and the ongoing FY26, largely due to prolonged uncertainty over Vodafone Idea’s outstanding dues and payment visibility.\n\nHe added that recent changes in buyback taxation would also be evaluated when the board meets in Q4. “When the Board considers the options of distribution in Q4, all the options will be put on the table and a call will be made.”\n\nAGR Relief Seen Supporting Customer Stability\n\nIndus management suggested that recent government actions related to adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues for Vodafone Idea have improved visibility around a key customer’s financial health.\n\n“Recent actions taken by the government on AGR dues for Vodafone Idea are expected to bring financial stability, aid its financial health, and enable sustained investments in network expansion and capacity augmentation,” Sah said.\n\nThe company also confirmed that receivables from Vodafone Idea are not a concern.\n\n“I think we don't have any outstanding due from them, especially the overdue part. It’s business as usual based on the credit period as per the agreements,” Sah said.\n\nAddressing earlier caution around payouts, Sah explained that past board considerations were linked to uncertainty around a major customer’s financial stability.\n\n“The two main considerations were the conditions of a major customer. At the time, there was less clarity in terms of what the plan was for that particular customer and their financial stability.”\n\nWith visibility improving and tenancy additions picking up, management signalled a more constructive backdrop.\n\n“Building on the momentum we saw in the previous quarter, Q3 witnessed a healthy pickup in tenancy additions, particularly from one of our large customers. This reflects a gradual improvement in network investment activity as the operating environment for the customer continues to improve,” Sah said.\n\nOn international growth, Indus Towers reiterated that its Africa foray will be largely organic, focused on greenfield tower deployment rather than acquisitions. “Africa is not a short-term strategy, it’s a long-term strategy. It’s organic growth driven,” Sah said.\n\nThe company is currently assessing three countries and laying operational groundwork before commencing deployments. “We are in the initial stages of assessing the three countries in terms of operations — how the sites are built, what kind of supplier ecosystem exists, and how we can add value by reducing costs and creating differentiation for customers.”\n\nInitial capital expenditure for Africa is expected to be debt-funded, though the structure is still under evaluation.“Whatever initial CAPEX would be required, although nothing major, would be debt-funded,” Sah said.\n\nThe level at which the debt would be raised remains undecided. “It could be at the UAE level, it could also be at the GIFT City level. We are yet to work on those details.”\n\nWhile prioritising organic growth, the company remains selectively open to acquisitions. “If any inorganic opportunity is considered, it will be at a valuation that we can agree upon or that will make sense to us,” Sah said.",

        "full_content": "PB Fintech closed almost 7 percent down on February 3, underperforming the broader market which rode the India-US deal euphoria to end the day 2.6 percent higher, as Macquarie raised concerns around the firm’s global ambitions.\n\nMacquarie flagged risks linked to capital allocation and strategic focus as PB Fintech signalled plans for international expansion and a potential capital raise to pursue inorganic opportunities.\n\nThe brokerage’s commentary may have reignited investor unease over unrelated diversification, particularly at a time when the company’s India business continues to deliver strong growth, profitability and market dominance, and when the original investment thesis was firmly anchored in domestic scale rather than overseas expansion.\n\n“When a company is growing its India revenues at over 40 percent, commands more than 90 percent market share in its core line of business, and accounts for close to 25 percent of the term and retail health insurance market, the investment narrative is usually built around deepening domestic dominance rather than geographic expansion,” Macquarie said.\n\nThe scale of the domestic opportunity remains structurally compelling.\n\nAccording to the most recent annual report by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), retail health insurance added 40 lakh new lives in FY25, of which Policybazaar accounted for roughly 40 percent. That translates into nearly 16 lakh new insured lives coming through a single platform in one year, underlining both market power and the continued depth of underpenetration in India’s insurance ecosystem.\n\nOperationally, the business continues to deliver strong numbers.\n\nPB Fintech reported a 165 percent year-on-year jump in profit after tax in Q3 FY26 to Rs 1.9 billion, driven by revenue growth of 37 percent year-on-year. Insurance revenues grew 39 percent, total insurance premiums rose 45 percent, and growth was led by the protection business, which expanded 68 percent year-on-year, and the new health insurance business, which grew 79 percent.\n\nMargins improved across EBITDA and PAT, reinforcing the strength of the core India franchise.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of accelerating domestic performance, management has indicated plans to pursue international expansion through inorganic opportunities.\n\nMacquarie said the company has called a board meeting to seek approval for a qualified institutional placement (QIP) to fund strategic investments, acquisitions or partnerships in local or international markets, with management stating that a target has already been identified.\n\nThe brokerage categorises this as “unrelated diversification” and flags renewed concerns around capital allocation, particularly considering investor unease following the company’s earlier hospital venture.\n\nFounder Yashish Dahiya defended the strategy on the earnings call, arguing that international financial services markets are highly profitable but lack innovation, positioning PB Fintech as a potential disruptor.\n\nHe also framed global expansion as both a diversification strategy and a statement of ambition, saying that India should create its own multinational companies rather than remaining only a market for global tech giants. The vision, as articulated by management, is “one of value creation through innovation export and geographic diversification”.\n\nMacquarie, while maintaining a “neutral” rating, said the stock already trades at valuations that factor in strong revenue and earnings growth, leaving limited room for strategic missteps.\n\nThe brokerage highlighted risks associated with unrelated diversification and capital deployment outside the core business.",

        "full_content": "Personal loans are easy to take and surprisingly hard to undo if you get them wrong. The money arrives quickly, paperwork is minimal, and it feels like a clean solution to a messy problem. But interest costs, credit score impact and repayment stress often show up later. Thinking a little ahead, and acting smartly after the loan hits your account, can make a big difference.\n\nBefore you borrow, get clear on why you need the loan\n\nWith personalloansbecoming more and more accessible—every other call or text message on your phone is offering you one—they can feel like the best and easiest solution for when you need ready money. But this is usually where many people slip up. Just because it’s easy to get, doesn’t mean you should take it.\n\nApersonal loanworks best if you use it as a one-off to clear urgent monetary requirements like emergency medical bills, or repairs or as a way to consolidate your credit card debt. If you are thinking of borrowing for lifestyle upgrades such as buying a new phone, or a designer purse or even that foreign trip, it’s best to move on.\n\nAsk yourself whether this expense is unavoidable and whether there’s a cheaper way to fund it. If the answer is no, a personal loan may still be the right choice, but at least it’s a conscious one.\n\nCheck what you actually qualify for, not what ads promise\n\nBanks and apps love to advertise low interest rates, but those rates are usually reserved for borrowers with excellent credit profiles. Banks need to be sure that you will repay the loan, and among the first things they will look at to gauge that is your credit score and how stable your income is.\n\nApply with lenders where you already have a salary account or long relationship first. They often offer better rates and faster approvals. Avoid applying to multiple lenders at once, since each application creates a hard inquiry and too many can hurt your credit score.\n\nBorrow only what you can repay comfortably\n\nJust because you are being offered a higher amount, doesn’t mean you should take it. Be sure of what exactly your financial need is and calculate your suspected monthly EMIs to be sure that you can comfortably pay them off every month.\n\nA good rule of thumb is that total EMIs across all loans should not eat up more than a manageable portion of your monthly income. Leave room for emergencies, savings and normal life. Stretching yourself too thin is how personal loans turn into long term stress.\n\nOnce the money comes in, separate it mentally and practically\n\nAfter disbursal, use the loan strictly for the purpose you borrowed it for. If possible, keep it in a separate account so it doesn’t get mixed up with everyday spending.\n\nThis helps prevent the common trap of using leftover funds casually and then struggling with EMIs later for money that didn’t really solve the original problem.\n\nSet up repayments on autopilot immediately\n\nThe fastest way to damage your credit score is to miss a personal loan EMI. Set up auto debit for the full EMI amount, not just the minimum, and keep a buffer in the account.\n\nIf your income is irregular, consider keeping one or two EMIs aside in advance. Peace of mind is worth more than the small interest you might earn elsewhere.\n\nReview your loan after six to twelve months\n\nIf your income improves or interest rates fall, check whether prepaying part of the loan or refinancing makes sense. Many personal loans allow partial prepayments after a lock in period.\n\nReducing the outstanding principal early can save a meaningful amount in interest and shorten the loan tenure.\n\nBorrowing well is about discipline, not speed\n\nA personal loan isn’t good or bad by itself. It’s a tool. Used carefully, it can get you through a tight phase without long term damage. Used casually, it can linger far longer than the problem it was meant to solve.\n\nThe smartest borrowers focus less on getting approved quickly and more on managing the loan calmly after the money arrives.",

We need to wait and see the RBI stance today and in the coming days,” they added.\n\nHistorically, the rupee’s biggest intraday appreciation was recorded on December 18, 2018, when it surged 1.62 percent, followed by a 1.51 percent jump on November 11, 2022, according to the Bloomberg data.\n\nThe February 3, 2026 rally of 1.48 percent now joins this list, surpassing several other notable episodes including November 2, 2018 (1.40 percent) and May 20, 2019 (1.29 percent).\n\nOther large single-day moves were largely concentrated around periods of heightened global volatility, such as March 2020, when pandemic-driven market dislocations triggered sharp currency swings.\n\n“The recent trade agreement and tariff reduction to 18% open the door for modest appreciation, but the pace and extent will depend on RBI intervention thresholds, given the priority of maintaining export competitiveness. Foreign inflows may improve at the margin, though a sharp shift is unlikely as global investors remain focused on AI, quantum, memory, and data-center themes,” said Anindya Banerjee, Head Currency and Commodity Research at Kotak Securities.\n\nCurrency experts believe that the local currency is expected to remain in the range of 89-91 range against the US dollar.",

        "full_content": "Over the past few days, Bitcoin investors liquidated over $2.5 billion worth of tokens globally, with prices brieflyplunging to the $75,000 range. Closer home, investors reacted by buying the dip, as top Indian crypto exchanges reported nearly 30-90 percent jump in buying activity.\n\nProminent crypto exchanges such as CoinSwitch saw a clear pickup in activity with buying interest rising by nearly 30 percent as investors actively use market corrections to accumulate assets.\n\nOn Mudrex, trading volumes were up roughly 70–90 percent across products. Instead of rushing for the exits, buying continues to dominate selling, CEO Edul Patel toldMoneycontrolon February 3.\n\nCoinDCX saw a steady increase in trading volumes from 269 million USDT in December to roughly 309 million USDT by January end.\n\nFor WazirX, however, the reaction remained mixed as experienced crypto investors are buying selectively keeping the overall trading activity on the exchange moderate.\n\nAccording to Balaji Srihari, VP, Business, CoinSwitch, during market volatility, investors continue to pick relatively stable tokens like BTC, ETH (Ether), and SOL (Solana) and a few large altcoins, as they remain cautious.\n\n“We are seeing the same trend on our platform, with investors actively accumulating these assets,” he toldMoneycontrol.\n\nNischal Shetty, Founder, Wazirx, said: “Overall sentiment remains defensive, with participants prioritising capital preservation over aggressive risk-taking.”\n\nWhat’s causing the current crash?\n\nIndustry experts called the ongoing Bitcoin crash a reflection of the global trade-related uncertainties and pressure across US equities and commodities, such gold and silver, after the Federal Reserve  kept interest rates unchanged at 3.5–3.75 percent in its January meeting -- pointing to a broader risk-off environment.\n\n“It’s a reaction to a new set of global uncertainties. Markets across the world have shifted into risk-off mode as geopolitical tensions rise around the US and Iran, and policy uncertainty in the US points to the possibility of a government shutdown,” said Mudrex’s Patel.\n\nAccording to Sumit Gupta, Co-founder, CoinDCX, in the short term, price action is getting shaped by macro uncertainty, ETF flows, and the unwinding of leverage. These factors dominate during phases like this, even when \"long-term fundamentals remain unchanged\".\n\n\"Institutional participation, post-halving supply dynamics, and overall ecosystem maturity are still intact. What we’re seeing now looks like a period of adjustment. Liquidity is improving, buying interest is gradually returning, and confidence is stabilising,\" he said.\n\nPurushottam Anand, Founder, Crypto Legal, doesn’t view this sudden price drop as a continuation of the October crash, and wouldn't recommend reading much into this crash as the prices of other asset classes, including silver and gold, too have corrected.\n\n“As a risk-on asset, crypto is more sensitive to extreme market moves and price is also driven by the nature and fundamentals of each tokens,” he toldMoneycontrol.\n\nWill there be further downside to Bitcoin prices?\n\nAlthough Bitcoin prices inched up slightly to breach the $78,000 level on February 3, crypto exchanges expect possible volatility and further downside.\n\nIndustry experts see further downside risk in the near term, if macro pressures persist and liquidity remains thin.\n\n“At the same time, forecasts are mixed, and a rebound is possible, should risk sentiment improve and demand return, reinforcing the view that volatility and uncertainty are likely to remain elevated,” said Shetty.\n\nSrihari added, “A more durable recovery would likely require an improvement in global risk sentiments and clearer macro stability.”\n\nSrihari has pegged $64,000 as the “key psychological support” on the downside. “Historically, such corrective phases tend to attract strong dip-buying interest, as investors view declines as accumulation opportunities rather than a breakdown in market structure.”\n\nMeanwhile, Vikram Subburaj, CEO, Giottus, advised Indian traders to keep size disciplined.\n\n“They should anchor risk to the $74,500-$75,000 BTC floor and only add exposure if BTC can hold above $80,000 for more than a single session. Otherwise, this remains a “sell-the-rally/buy-the-dip carefully” tape,” he said.",

        "full_content": "Bajaj Auto is set to undertake a major overhaul of its flagship Pulsar brand, with the company planning a completely refreshed Pulsar portfolio over the next four to five months. The two-wheeler major has lined up eight product interventions, underscoring its aggressive push to strengthen its position in the highly competitive 125cc-plus motorcycle segment.\n\nPulsar remains Bajaj Auto’s most important brand, contributing the maximum share to the company’s overall motorcycle sales. According to the company, a series of upgrades and refreshes introduced since November has already begun to show positive results, particularly in the 150cc-plus category.\n\nSpeaking to analysts on January 30 about the strategy, Bajaj Auto executive director Rakesh Sharma said following the festival season, the company accelerated its launch and refresh cycle. “After the heat and dust of the festival settled down, a slew of new launches prioritised for the 150cc-plus segment have been made November onwards. Consequently, market share in this key segment has started to move up,” Sharma said.\n\nHe added that seven interventions in the form of upgrades and refreshes have been rolled out over the past two months, helping drive growth and market share in a favourable demand environment. “The waves of these interventions will be unrelenting here onwards, with over eight more such interventions being made in the next four months,” Sharma noted.\n\nBy the end of this cycle, Bajaj Auto expects the entire Pulsar range to be comprehensively refreshed. This will include the original Pulsar models, the modern N-series, and the performance-focused NS-series.\n\n“By the end of this period, the entire Pulsar portfolio would be a complete, potent, and persuasive portfolio,” Sharma said, adding the company expects to outpace industry growth in the 125cc-plus segment, especially in the 150cc-plus category, and continue gaining market share.\n\nOn the broader industry outlook, Sharma said demand momentum had been stronger than anticipated. Bajaj Auto expects the industry to grow at around 12–15 percent over the next few months. However, he cautioned that inflation could pose a risk. “The only spoiler could be inflation – fuel, rental – which could diminish the purchasing power of our consumer,” he said.\n\nBeyond Pulsar, Bajaj Auto is also evaluating the need for expanding its brand portfolio. Sharma acknowledged a clear gap in the 125cc segment and said plans are underway to address it. He also pointed out that while the Dominar brand has limited presence in India, it performs significantly better in overseas markets. “We sell more 250cc-plus bikes in Mexico than we sell in India,” he said.\n\nThe company is also exploring entry into new motorcycle formats, including on-road and off-road bikes, either through a new brand or by reviving one of its dormant brands. “It may not be absolutely new brands, but it could be one of the brands we possessed but has been dormant,” Sharma added.",

        "full_content": "The gains in the rupee following the India-US trade deal announcement have opened a tactical window for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to add to its already robust foreign exchange reserves but any aggressive build-up looks unlikely, Kunal Sodhani, Head of Treasury at Shinhan Bank, said in an interview to Moneycontrol.\n\nOn February 3, the rupee recorded its biggest single-day gain since mid-December 2018 after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and United States President Donald Trump's late-night annoucements  ignited investor optimism and spurred foreign inflows. The rupee gained 1.4 percent to touch 90.22 against the dollar.\n\nWith India’s FX reserves already at an all-time high of around $709 billion and providing close to 11 months of import cover, Sodhani said the central bank may use sustained inflows to nudge the reserves towards the $720-725 billion zone as a buffer against geopolitical risks and unforeseen shocks rather than chasing a significantly higher stockpile.Edited excerpts of the interview:\n\nAfter the announcement of the US-India trade deal, the dynamics of the currency market seem to have changed. The rupee has appreciated around 1.4 percent, the highest since December 2018. How do you see this shift and what does it mean for the currency in the near and long term?\n\nSo, first of all, I think the sentiment-driven demand for the rupee has obviously strengthened because foreign investors will reassess their risk and they will consider India as a destination to invest. Secondly, if we talk about the lower tariffs, which will make India’s exports more competitive in the US, potentially, it will narrow the current account deficit over time, which is a structural positive for the currency.\n\nAnd third, the tariff cut gives India a relative export advantage compared with many Asian competitors such as Vietnam, Bangladesh, Pakistan, who face similar or higher US tariffs. So overall, it remains a positive sentiment.\n\nBut there are a few concerns from my side which can act as a headwind. If we actually read the tweets from both sides, from Trump as well as India, Trump has been very clear that there will be some kind of bilateral trade business to the tune of $500 billion.\n\nMy concern here is, first, there is no communication from our Prime Minister over it. Second, there are no nitty-gritties on how this $500 billion will be placed and what would be the outcome. Third, if I even draw the numbers, India’s exports to the US are around $85 billion annually, while imports from the US are around $45 billion annually. So, taking that into cue, I don’t know where this $500 billion of trade comes from, how it will impact, or whether it will actually take place or not. So, I would rather wait for more clarity instead of jumping the gun that it is purely positive.\n\nAnd second, about Russian oil imports, we have not commented anything on that yet. We have only commented that tariffs have been lowered from 25 percent to 18 percent. So these two concerns prevail for me at this point in time.\n\nSo, are you saying this is more of an initial rally, with concerns likely to emerge later for the currency market?\n\nCorrect. Till the point we don’t have clarity, knee-jerk sentimental optimism will prevail, which is what we saw today. But for a sustainable appreciation or sustainable flows into equity markets, we will have to wait and watch for more clarity.\n\nGiven this appreciation, do you think the RBI will use the opportunity to build forex reserves further, especially when reserves are already around $700 billion?\n\nAt the current juncture, we are standing at around $709 billion of FX reserves, which is an all-time high. Even during periods of depreciation, we have seen appreciation in FX reserves at large.\n\nWhenever flows are positive and if they are sustainable, the RBI can absorb those flows and create more FX reserves to build a cushion. Currently, we have around 11 months of import cover, which itself is very good. So I don’t think much more ammunition is required but geopolitical uncertainties or unforeseen events can always come up. So, the RBI may want to grow reserves towards maybe $720-725 billion.\n\nIf reserves move towards $725-730 billion, will that growth be driven more by foreign currency assets (FCAs) or gold?\n\nIt is very difficult to comment but it has to be a mix. It cannot be purely gold. Revaluation will also happen, and considering the drop in gold prices, revaluation may take the overall number lower on a week-on-week basis.\n\nBut overall, central banks will continue to have gold in their kitty. FCAs contribute around 85 percent of India’s FX reserves, which is a very large chunk, and I think that will prevail. I don’t think there will be any replacement, they will grow hand in hand.\n\nWhat levels do you see for the rupee by the end of March, once the initial optimism fades and uncertainties resurface?\n\nIf I talk about dollar-rupee levels, March typically sees higher rupee demand due to corporate book closing, which provides some support to the rupee but that is just one part of the story; global cues also matter.\n\nOverall, I see a broader band of 89.20 at the lower end, very optimistically, and 92.2 on the higher side. At this point, because of sentiment benefits, 92 looks far off and remains the most crucial resistance but 89.20–89.50 levels can be tested.\n\nWill this optimism around the trade deal and the rupee’s appreciation drive sustained foreign flows, especially after recent equity and debt outflows?\n\nFlows remain very crucial for a developing country like India, though FPIs are hot money. In January, we saw nearly $4 billion of outflows. I think flows may remain volatile. I do not expect any sharp inflows because uncertainty still prevails. One or two days of optimism have not changed the entire macro landscape. So flows may not turn extremely positive and volatility will continue.\n\nThe RBI has been active with swap auctions and the forward book in the three-year segment is building up. How concerning is this and does the current shift in currency markets ease that concern?\n\nThe RBI’s buy-sell swaps, like the $10 billion swap on February 4, are primarily to elongate the maturity profile of the forward book, pushing positions into one, two, three-year or longer segments rather than expanding overall liquidity. From that perspective, RBI has done a good job.\n\nAt the same time, they are focusing on other liquidity measures such as VRRs and OMOs. For July, we expect around $23.6 billion worth of rupee liquidity through VRRs, buy-sell swaps and OMOs. This should improve durable liquidity conditions and help stabilise short-term money market rates.\n\nWe should wait and watch how liquidity measures pan out. One-year annualised premiums should sustain around 2.6 percent to 2.8 percent.\n\nFinally, what are your near-term and long-term projections for the rupee?\n\nOver a longer horizon, say by December 2026, I believe 89.50 to 93 will be the broader range.",

        "full_content": "Gold rose, clawing back some losses after the abrupt unwinding of a record-breaking rally that had driven prices down 13% in just two days. Silver also advanced.\n\nSpot gold climbed as much as 4.2% to over $4,855 an ounce, after falling 4.8% in the previous session to extend a slump on Friday that was the steepest in more than a decade. Silver rose as much as 8.1% – taking it above $85 and erasing the previous day’s loss – before paring gains.\n\n“The foundations supporting gold today are largely unchanged from those that prevailed prior to the correction on Friday,” Ahmad Assiri, a market strategist at Pepperstone Group Ltd. said by email. “That said, volatility is likely to remain heightened in the near term as markets continue to digest the recent dislocation and reassess risk appetite.”\n\nPrecious metals had plunged from record highs that shocked even seasoned traders. An already-scorching rally accelerated sharply last month, as investors piled into gold and silver on renewed concerns about geopolitical upheaval, currency debasement and threats to the Federal Reserve’s independence.\n\nA wave of buying from Chinese speculators supercharged the rally, but this flipped on Friday as the US dollar rebounded. At Monday’s close, gold was 17% below the all-time peak of $5,595.47 hit on Jan. 29, while silver had declined by more than a third.\n\nThe extent to which Chinese investors choose to buy the dip will play a key role in determining the direction of the market. Over the weekend, buyers flocked to the country’s biggest bullion marketplace in Shenzhen to stock up on gold jewelry and bars ahead of the Lunar New Year. China’s markets will be closed for just over a week from Feb. 16 for the holidays. The country’s major state-owned banks are tightening controls on gold investments to manage the volatility.\n\nSome banks have backed gold to recover, with Deutsche Bank AG saying in a note on Monday that it was standing by its forecast for bullion to rally to $6,000 an ounce.\n\nInvestors are also monitoring the situation in Iran, after US President Donald Trump said talks over a new nuclear deal could happen in coming days. A diplomatic breakthrough could diminish some of gold’s appeal as a safe-haven investment and pressure prices.\n\n“Both the violent selloff and equally sharp recovery underscore a hypersensitive market driven by abrupt, headline-led emotion rather than clear direction, leaving sharp and uncomfortable volatility as the near-term norm,” Hebe Chen, an analyst at Vantage Markets in Melbourne said by email.\n\nGold rose 3% to $4,799.77 an ounce at 11:50 a.m. in Singapore. Silver advanced 4.6% to $82.91 an ounce, while platinum and palladium also climbed. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a gauge of the US currency, edged down 0.2% after ending the previous session 0.3% higher.",

        "full_content": "Bain Capital-backed auto components maker Dhoot Transmission has filed draft papers with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) under the confidential pre-filing route, to raise around $250 million through a mix of primary and secondary share sale.\n\nThe confidential filing route allows issuers to fine-tune their initial public offer (IPO) plans away from public scrutiny in the early stages.\n\nFounded in 1999 by Rahul Dhoot, Dhoot Transmission is a supplier to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) across the automotive and consumer durables segments.\n\nIt manufactures wiring harnesses, automotive switches, electronic sensors and controllers, connectors and terminals, automotive cables, power cords and battery packs. Its products are used across a wide range of applications, including two-wheelers, three-wheelers, passenger and commercial vehicles, off-road vehicles, agricultural equipment, medical devices and domestic appliances.\n\nBain Capital holds a 49 percent stake in Dhoot Transmission. The private equity firm invested in Dhoot in January 2025.\n\nThe company has steadily built a global footprint, with customers across eight countries and three continents.\n\nAs part of its overseas expansion, it set up an engineering and marketing office in the UK in 2012 and subsequently acquired TFC Cables in Scotland in 2017, which included a manufacturing facility in Slovakia. This was followed by the acquisitions of Parkinson Harness in the UK in 2018 and San Electromec in 2019.\n\nAccording to a CRISIL Ratings May 2025 credit rating report, Dhoot Transmission is among the largest players in the automotive wire harness and cables segment, supplying to all major automotive OEMs. Its counts Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor Company, Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India and Royal Enfield among its marquee customers.\n\nThe company’s consolidated revenue rose to Rs 2,653 crore in FY24 from Rs 1,550 crore in FY22, with overseas operations contributing 15–20 percent of revenue.",

        "full_content": "Indian e-commerce startups are still waiting for more details on what the landmark India-US trade deal means for their sector, before they celebrate and recalibrate plans, according to several industry stakeholders\n\nTo be sure, several of the prominent e-commerce firms in India already have very limited dealing with the US which is another reason why their initial excitement is limited. Walmart-owned Flipkart, Amazon, Meesho, Snapdeal, Myntra, Ajio, Nykaa Fashion are some of the most popular e-commerce platforms in India.\n\nGood for consumption, e-commerce unfazed\n\n“No material impact or relief at the moment, unless the non-trade barriers that are being dropped include some concessions for US e-commerce companies to hold inventory. That will practically still not change anything because they already hold inventory in some way or another,” a senior executive at a large Indian e-commerce startup said.\n\nA founder at another e-commerce firm said it is “tough to comment on the details till the fine print is out. However, directionally it looks positive for the sector (for now).”\n\nA third senior executive said his company is not making any amends or celebrating yet because the e-commerce sector will largely experience no change from any trade deal between two of the largest democracies in the world.\n\nWhile sectors like e-commerce stand to gain very little from the first tranche of the India-US trade deal, other industrieslike IT services, GCCs, data centres, agriculture, technology and more will hugely benefit, at least according to preliminary information available.\n\n“From a consumption point of view, it’s good that there is no cloud over the IT Services sector which could have been perhaps negatively impacted if Trump went berserk,” the first executive added.\n\nIT, and tech at large, is one of the largest exports from India into the US and other regions. Clarity on that front helps Indian IT companies chart their growth plans accordingly since a bulk of their customer base is outside of India, with significant exposure to the US.\n\nSeafood and agri companies rejoice\n\nWhile tariffs on Indian exports to the US have been lowered from 50 percent to 18 percent, the tariffs on US imports into India have been eliminated as per the trade agreement.\n\nSo, while the larger e-commerce industry awaits details, certain sectors like seafood exports and more, within the realm of e-commerce, said the India-US trade deal would provide better infrastructure that will in turn formalise a fragmented market.\n\nEliminating tariffs on US imports improves access to advanced cold storage systems, processing equipment, and quality-control technologies that play a key role in food safety, shelf life, and consistency, according to Deepanshu Manchanda, MD at Zappfresh, a seafood exporter.\n\n“Better access to proven global technologies can help improve reliability across sourcing, processing, and last-mile delivery, especially as businesses expand across cities and regions,” he concluded.",

        "full_content": "By easing trade-related uncertainty and improving the earnings outlook, the India-US trade agreement is likely to help revive risk appetite at a time when the country's primary market has struggled to regain momentum after a hectic 2025.\n\nEquity markets have responded positively, with investors reading the deal as a reduction in external risks and a signal of policy stability. The benchmark Sensex opened trading on February 3 with a three percent jump, night after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump said a deal had been agreed to.\n\nAccording to Axis Securities, the agreement enhances earnings visibility, supports valuation re-rating, particularly for export-oriented and capex-linked sectors and reinforces India’s position as a relatively safe haven among emerging markets.\n\nThe brokerage sees the deal not as a short-term trigger but as a medium-term structural positive that could improve India’s export competitiveness, deepen manufacturing capabilities and strengthen global integration if execution remains consistent.\n\nFollow our live blog for the latest on the India-US trade deal\n\nThis shift in sentiment matters for the IPO market, which is highly sensitive to secondary market conditions, foreign investor participation and valuation comfort.\n\nAfter a strong September-to-December period, which saw 54 IPOs raise more than Rs 1 lakh crore, January 2026 saw just three mainboard IPOs, as issuers and bankers turned cautious amid valuation fatigue, volatile global cues and persistent foreign portfolio investor outflows. Several deals were pushed to the back burner as investors demanded sharper pricing discipline and clearer visibility on macro risks.\n\nHowever, market participants now believe the India-US trade deal could act as a turning point.\n\nInvestment bankers tracking deal pipelines said optimism has improved, with expectations that better sentiment could revive stalled IPO plans. “Yes, we are optimistic on the deal pipeline,\" said a senior investment banker at a Mumbai-based capital markets focused investment bank, adding if foreign institutional investors come back in a significant way then there could be a revival of animal spirits in the IPO market.\n\nA capital markets lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said a number of good-quality issues were languishing due to weak sentiment and the trade agreement would provide a positive signal. He, however, cautioned that the real test will be how markets behave over the next few weeks, particularly whether foreign investors return in a sustained manner.\n\nNet-sales of equities by foreign institutional investors in 2025 stood at approximately Rs 1.66 lakh crore.\n\nAxis Securities said export-oriented sectors with significant US exposure are likely to be key beneficiaries of the improved sentiment in the stock market.\n\nTextiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, auto ancillaries, IT services and select industrial companies stand to gain from improved market access, tariff rationalisation and greater supply-chain certainty. Over time, higher order inflows, better capacity utilisation and stronger earnings visibility in these sectors could support sustained growth and valuation re-rating, the brokerage said.\n\nFor the primary market, this combination of improved sentiment, potential revival in FII flows and more defensible valuations could reopen the fundraising window that largely stayed shut in January. With a healthy pipeline of companies already cleared or close to regulatory approvals, even a modest improvement in market conditions could translate into a meaningful pickup in deal activity.",

        "full_content": "The India-US trade deal has sparked a sharp relief rally in the rupee, but the currency’s next move will be determined by the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) intervention strategy and the direction of foreign portfolio flows, said Dhiraj Nim, economist at ANZ Research.\n\nWhile the agreement has improved risk appetite and led to the rupee’s biggest single-day gain since 2018, Nim said the near-term strength is likely to be tested by the levels at which the RBI begins replenishing foreign exchange reserves and by whether the move results in a sustained turnaround in FPI sentiment, particularly in equities.\n\nThe India–US trade deal has been finalised and the rupee has gained around 1.3 percent, its biggest single-day rise since December 18, 2018. Where do you see the currency next after such a sharp move?\n\nThis knee-jerk rally was expected after the announcement of the India–US trade deal, only the timing was uncertain for such an announcement. We expect the rupee to continue trading on the stronger side, at least in the near term. However, there are two factors we will be watching closely from here.\n\nFirst, the levels at which the RBI starts buying dollars and replenishing FX reserves. Second, whether this event and the rupee’s movement lead to a durable turnaround in FPI sentiment, particularly equity inflows. Near-term strength looks likely but the medium-term tendency of the rupee versus the US dollar would be to weaken, driven by structural factors.\n\nIs the appreciation enough, considering the sharp depreciation seen since tariffs were imposed? The rupee was around 86-87 earlier and then moved to nearly 92.\n\nThe rupee’s depreciation has mirrored India’s financial account challenges, particularly equity outflows. Importantly, equity outflows were not driven only by US tariff tensions. Several other factors contributed, including corporate earnings stress, nominal GDP stress, equity market valuation concerns, India’s lack of participation in the global AI rally and broader global risk factors.\n\nCurrency weakness, or expectations of further continued depreciation and trade frictions will now likely ease but many of the other drivers of rupee weakness persist. Viewed from that perspective, it would be unreasonable to expect a full reversal of the rupee’s depreciation that occurred over the last few quarters purely on account of the India–US trade deal.\n\nIf we strip out other uncertainties like the trade balance and FII outflows, and look only at tariff-related depreciation, what levels could be reasonable post the deal?\n\nI would closely watch the 89.5–90 levels for now. This is not just about unwinding tariff-related depreciation, but also about where the RBI will intervene to buy FX reserves. The RBI has spent around $25–30 billion over the past year to contain rupee weakness and also has a large net short forward book that it will need to settle. Considering these factors, 89.5–90 becomes an important support zone for USD/INR, and the RBI may not allow it to fall meaningfully below this range.\n\nAnother important aspect is that rupee weakness, while a concern, also significantly improved India’s competitiveness without hurting the broader macro economy. Now that expectations around the rupee may shift, the RBI could prefer holding the currency at a slightly weaker level than it otherwise would.\n\nThis helps preserve competitiveness gains from a real exchange rate perspective. The complication is that inflation is expected to rebound in 2026, which would push up the real exchange rate and erode competitiveness. Therefore, maintaining a mildly undervalued rupee could be important to support exports, even after the trade deal. This seems important because the effect of higher US tariffs on global trade is still playing out and will likely negatively impact global trade pie. This also means stronger export competition, especially when other currencies like the Chinese yuan are much more undervalued.\n\nWill this appreciation help ease pressure on rising bond yields?\n\nThere could be a turnaround in sentiment. For foreign portfolio investors, including in bonds, expectations of further currency weakness make dollar returns unattractive. If those expectations change and the rupee is no longer expected to weaken significantly from current levels, it could lead to a return of foreign investors, including into the bond market. However, fiscal concerns could be a dampening factor.\n\nThe RBI’s forward book has expanded due to USD/INR swaps, including the three-year swap operations since December. Could this limit the RBI’s ability to intervene in future shocks, even after the trade deal?\n\nThis is precisely why the RBI will look to rebuild spot FX reserves as opportunities arise from inflows. Higher spot reserves improve its ability to manage future risk events. At the same time, the RBI has a large net short forward book of around $63 billion, which also requires higher spot reserves for whenever the settlement arises.\n\nThe RBI will intervene to buy reserves partly to smooth appreciation-side volatility as well, if true to its commitment to contain volatility. But there is also a need to rebuild foreign currency assets. While headline FX reserves have not fallen as sharply due to gold revaluation gains, the recent correction in precious metals highlights the vulnerability of relying on gold valuations to keep spot overall FX reserves at a satisfactory level. There is no substitute for foreign currency assets in the FX reserve kitty, and those have declined.",

        "full_content": "Indian government bonds have shown little enthusiasm even after the long-standing trade tensions between India and the US eased, reflecting a shift in the debt market in terms of taking cues for the movement.\n\nWhile global cues such as tariff relief would typically provide some comfort to bond investors, yields have remained sticky, signalling that domestic factors, rather than external developments, are now driving market behaviour.\n\nThis is not the first time when bond market has failed to take cues from the global developments, but similar instances were also witnessed in the last few years. Previously, the Indian bond yield saw a sharp movement whenever there was a movement in the US Treasury yield.\n\nHowever, since the last two years, the movement in U.S. Treasury notes failed to move the needle for Indian bond yields.\n\nAt the heart of this is India’s increasingly Atmanirbhar bond market, where local supply-demand dynamics dominate price discovery. With the government’s gross market borrowing pegged at a record Rs 17.2 lakh crore for FY27, the sharply higher quantum of supply has kept an upward pressure on yields. Despite the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) calibrated liquidity management and comfort around inflation, investors remain cautious about absorbing large issuances without adequate yield compensation.\n\nUnlike in previous years, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have played a limited role in influencing bond movements. Even inclusion in global bond indices has not materially altered near-term sentiment, as domestic institutions, banks, insurance companies and provident funds, continue to be the primary buyers.\n\nThis reduced dependence on overseas flows has insulated the market from global volatility but has also meant that positive external triggers, such as trade deals or easing geopolitical risks, have had only a marginal impact.\n\nToday, the Indian bond yield opened 4 basis points (Bps) down at 6.727 percent.\n\nAnother key domestic overhang is the fiscal math. While the government has reiterated its commitment to fiscal consolidation, higher capital expenditure and modest tax buoyancy have raised questions about funding pressures ahead.\n\nBond investors are closely tracking divestment progress, small savings collections and the Centre’s ability to smoothen borrowing through switches and buybacks to prevent yields from hardening further.\n\nIn effect, India’s bond market is now behaving more like a closed ecosystem, less reactive to global optimism and more sensitive to domestic liquidity, borrowing and policy signals.\n\nFor investors, this Atmanirbhar shift means that reading Budget numbers, RBI liquidity cues and demand from local institutions may matter far more than tracking global risk-on or risk-off moves.",

This comes as precious metals rebounded from their lows.\n\nAnalysts have said that such a “violent” drop in the precious metals was more like a technical correction than a deterioration in core fundamentals, and that the longer term drivers remain intact.\n\nGold futures with March expiry on the MCX jumped nearly 4 percent to nearly hit the Rs 1.5 lakh per 10 grams mark. This comes after the contracts significantly dropped after hitting a fresh lifetime high of Rs 1,93,096 per 10 grams last week.\n\nThe futures with June expiry also rose 4 percent to Rs 1,52,551 per 10 grams.\n\nSilver futures with March expiry meanwhile rallied nearly 9 percent to Rs 2,57,480 per 10 grams. The futures had significantly fallen after hitting a Rs 4,20,048 per 10 grams.\n\nHDFC Silver ETF jumped nearly 10 percent in the early trading hours, while Mirae Asset Silver ETF, SBI Silver ETF, Tata Silver ETF, Groww Silver ETF, UTI Silver ETF anf several others also gained up to 10 percent.\n\nInvesco India Gold ETF and Groww Gold ETF gained around 5 percent, while Baroda BNP Paribas Gold ETF, Axis Mutual Fund Gold ETF, HDFC Gold ETF, Nippon India Gold ETF and few others gained around 4 percent each.\n\nWhy are gold and silver prices rising today?\n\nA dramatic unwind which hit gold and silver markets over the past two days, erased a chunk of their record breaking January gains. The plunge began after CME Group hiked margin requirements on both metals, forcing leveraged traders to liquidate positions and accelerating a wave of selling. In additions, the selloff intensified as markets digested reports that US President Donald Trump is set to nominate Kevin Warsh—viewed as a hawkish, dollar supportive choice—as the next Federal Reserve Chair. The shift revived expectations of tighter policy and triggered a sharp rebound in the U.S. dollar, which is negative for precious metals.\n\n“The correction was amplified by extreme overbought conditions after gold and silver touched unprecedented highs just days earlier, with silver having surged more than 60% in a month and gold over 20%. Profit taking cascaded into panic selling as liquidity thinned and volatility spiked,” said Hareesh V, Head of Commodity Research, Geojit Investments.\n\n“The violent drop more like a technical correction than a deterioration in core fundamentals, noting that longer term drivers—geopolitical tensions, central bank buying and macro uncertainty—remain intact,” he added.\n\n\"It's a reasonable call that this is somewhere around fair value potentially, if you consider that we saw a market behaving fairly irrationally for a few weeks there,\" Reuters quoted Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.com, as saying.\n\nThe sharp rise in the precious metals also comes amid rising expectations for at least two rate cuts by the American Federal Reserve this year.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

US President Donald J Trump announced that the tariffs on India have been reduced from 50 percent to 18 percent.\n\nThe 10-year benchmark bond yield opened at 6.727 percent, as compared to 6.766 percent at the previous close.\n\nSharing details of the call on Truth Social, Trump said, “Out of friendship and respect for Prime Minister Modi and, as per his request, effective immediately, we agreed to a Trade Deal between the United States and India, whereby the United States will charge a reduced Reciprocal Tariff, lowering it from 25 percent to 18 percent.”\n\nTrump described Modi as “one of my greatest friends” and a “powerful and respected leader of his country,” adding that the two leaders discussed trade, global security and efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nAccording to the US President, Prime Minister Modi also agreed that India would stop buying Russian oil and instead increase purchases from the United States and potentially Venezuela. Trump claimed the move would help bring an end to the war in Ukraine, which he said was “taking place right now, with thousands of people dying each and every week.”\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi had tweeted on X that Wonderful to speak with my dear friend President Trump today. Delighted that Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18%. Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement.\n\nOn February 2, Indian bond yield ended over one year higher after the government announced higher-than-expected gross borrowing through government securities. The Union Budget pegged gross market borrowings at Rs 17.2 lakh crore for FY27, a 16 percent increase over the current year’s budget estimate, while net market borrowing was set at Rs 11.7 lakh crore to finance a fiscal deficit of 4.3 percent of GDP.\n\nBond market participants said the headline fiscal numbers were largely reassuring, but the elevated gross supply of dated securities could weigh on yields until clarity emerges on demand conditions. This makes a strong case for support from the Reserve Bank of India, which is critical to gauge the next course of direction for the market.",

        "full_content": "The India–US trade deal announced by US President Donald Trump is expected to support export-oriented and strategic sectors such as IT services, AI-led technology work and engineering goods, with analysts pointing to improved trade competitiveness and market sentiment.\n\n“From a sectoral lens, export-oriented segments such as IT services, pharmaceuticals, specialty chemicals, auto ancillaries and select engineering goods stand to benefit the most,” said Sonam Srivastava, founder and fund manager at Wright Research PMS.\n\nShe said lower tariff barriers improve price competitiveness for Indian firms in the US, India’s largest export destination, which could translate into better order inflows, margin stability and higher capacity utilisation over time.\n\nSrivastava added that the sharp surge in GIFT Nifty reflects an immediate repricing of risk, driven by expectations of stronger bilateral economic alignment and lower input costs for exporters.\n\nPresident Trump added that India had agreed to a broader package beyond tariff cuts.\n\nHe said India would reduce its tariffs and non-tariff barriers against US goods to zero and commit to buying more than $500 billion worth of US energy, technology, agricultural products, coal and other goods.\n\n\"The US Tech fims will sell cloud, datacenter, AI services in India through Indian resellers. It removes the fear that India will build its own technology stack and not buy from US Tech companies. India will continue to buy from US Tech companies likes of Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Salesforce, Servicenow, Dell etc as per deal,\" said Pareekh Jain on $500 bn investment expected from India for American tech.\n\nUnder the deal, the US will reduce reciprocal tariffs on India from 25% to 18%, while India has committed to cutting tariffs and non-tariff barriers on US goods to zero.\n\nHowever, analysts tracking the IT services sector cautioned against expecting a sharp near-term revenue uplift.\n\n“This announcement is symbolically important, but the direct impact on Indian IT services will be modest in the near term,” said Phil Fersht, chief executive and founder of IT Advisory firm HFS Research.\n\nHe noted that tariffs primarily affect goods trade, while IT services remain governed by visa policy, data regulation, procurement norms and enterprise technology spending.\n\nFersht said the larger impact lies in sentiment and strategic alignment. A softer US–India trade posture could reduce geopolitical friction and support boardroom conversations, particularly around higher-value engineering and AI-led work, even if near-term deal economics remain unchanged.\n\nAnalysts also said the agreement strengthens India’s positioning as a preferred partner amid global supply chain realignments, though sustained gains will depend on policy execution and earnings follow-through.\n\n\"Key sectors that can benefit include textiles and apparel, auto ancillaries and engineering, specialty chemicals, agro and seafood exports, and select electronics and consumer manufacturers with US exposure. This aligns well with the recent budget, which clearly focuses on exports, manufacturing, and integrating India deeper into global supply chain,\" Divam Sharma, Co-Founder and Fund Manager at Green Portfolio said.\n\nThe trade deal comes just a day after India presented the Union Budget, which laid out measures to support manufacturing, technology adoption and export competitiveness.",

The local currency ended at 91.5363 against the US dollar, as compared to 91.9900 against the greenback at previous close.\n\nThe rupee gained 48 paise on February 2 -- the highest level since December 19, 2025 -- when it appreciated 60 paise in a single day. In percentage terms, it is up 0.52 percent, compared to previous close.\n\nThe gain in the domestic currency was due to timely intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the spot forex market.\n\nSharing details of the call on Truth Social, Trump said, “Out of friendship and respect for Prime Minister Modi and, as per his request, effective immediately, we agreed to a Trade Deal between the United States and India, whereby the United States will charge a reduced Reciprocal Tariff, lowering it from 25 percent to 18 percent.”\n\nTrump described Modi as “one of my greatest friends” and a “powerful and respected leader of his country,” adding that the two leaders discussed trade, global security and efforts to end the Russia Ukraine war.\n\nAccording to the US President, Prime Minister Modi also agreed that India would stop buying Russian oil and instead increase purchases from the United States and potentially Venezuela. Trump claimed the move would help bring an end to the war in Ukraine, which he said was “taking place right now, with thousands of people dying each and every week.”\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi had tweeted on X that Wonderful to speak with my dear friend President Trump today. Delighted that Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18%. Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement.\n\n“When two large economies and the world’s largest democracies work together, it benefits our people and unlocks immense opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation. President Trump’s leadership is vital for global peace, stability, and prosperity. India fully supports his efforts for peace. I look forward to working closely with him to take our partnership to unprecedented heights,” Modi added.",

        "full_content": "India’s top automotive lobby body the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) has projected a moderate growth outlook for the domestic passenger vehicle industry, pegging sales expansion at 5–6 percent for both FY26 and FY27, amid persistent global and cost-related challenges.\n\nThe projection was shared during a SIAM conclave held a couple of weeks ago, which brought together all major passenger vehicle manufacturers operating in India. The industry-wide consensus reflects cautious optimism, balancing policy support with lingering macroeconomic uncertainties. A 6 percent growth over FY25 will push the FY26 total to 4.55 million and a further 6 percent growth on that will put the FY27 total at 4.83 million.\n\nTarun Garg, Managing Director and CEO of Hyundai Motor India, said the guidance marks a slight improvement over the historical growth trend. “SIAM held a conclave where they provided guidance of 5–6% growth in the industry. If you look at the CAGR (compounded annual growth rate), it has been around 4–5% (over the previous years),” Garg said in a post earnings call on February 2.\n\nWhile measures such as the GST cut have provided some relief and demand stimulus, Garg noted that external factors continue to weigh on buyer sentiment. “Though the GST cut benefit is there, geopolitical challenges remain, which impacts buyer sentiments,” he added, highlighting concerns ranging from global conflicts to supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures.\n\nSIAM did not provide comments on sales projections provided by it, when contacted. The April to December period saw the passenger vehicle industry clock 6 percent year-on-year growth in volumes to 3.32 million units, with utility vehicles growing by nearly 8% to 2.2 million.\n\nCost pressures remain another key concern for automakers. A senior Hyundai official said the industry has been navigating a difficult operating environment, marked by rising input costs and volatility in global commodity markets. Hyundai raised prices on its models in January, 2026.\n\n“The industry has been going through tough times. To some extent, we have tried to absorb the cost, along with a price increase in January,” the official said.\n\nLooking ahead, Hyundai said it will closely track commodity price movements, particularly in precious metals, which are critical inputs for automotive components. “There is huge volatility in precious metals. We will have to undertake countermeasures to mitigate this impact as much as possible,” the official added.\n\nThe steady increase in prices of raw materials and constant slide in the value of the Indian currency against all major currencies, is pushing up costs.\n\nIndustry executives say the projected 5–6% growth reflects a realistic assessment of current conditions—steady demand recovery on one hand, and geopolitical uncertainty and cost inflation on the other. While structural drivers such as improving infrastructure, rising aspirations, and policy support continue to underpin long-term growth, near-term performance is expected to remain measured rather than exuberant.\n\nSIAM’s outlook suggests that the passenger vehicle industry is entering a phase of stable, sustainable growth, with manufacturers focusing on cost management, pricing discipline, and portfolio optimisation to navigate an increasingly complex global environment.",

        "full_content": "The compact SUV segment has emerged as the biggest beneficiary of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) cut, according to Hyundai Motor India’s senior management, as shifting consumer preferences continue to reshape the passenger vehicle market.\n\nTarun Garg, Managing Director and CEO of Hyundai Motor India, said that while growth is visible across all vehicle segments, compact SUVs are clearly outperforming others in the post-GST cut phase.\n\n“All segments are growing, but there is a strong consumer preference for the compact SUV segment,” Garg said in a post earnings call on February 2, pointing to changing sales trends over the course of the year.\n\nSharing segment-wise data, Garg explained that hatchbacks have seen a marginal decline in their contribution to overall sales.\n\n“From January to August, hatchbacks contributed 22.4% of the market, but from September to December this reduced to 21.4%,” he said.\n\nThis drop, he added, has been absorbed almost entirely by compact SUVs.\n\n“The compact SUV segment went up from 22.1% to 23%. So, very clearly, the maximum benefit of growth from the GST cut has come to compact SUVs.”\n\nHyundai believes the momentum is not limited to urban markets alone. Garg noted that SUV penetration in rural areas is now slightly higher than in urban centres, driven by improving infrastructure and evolving consumer aspirations.\n\n“The aspiration is the same in rural India as in urban India, and infrastructure improvement in rural areas has really helped,” he said.\n\nThe GST cut has acted as a catalyst, providing additional momentum to demand, though Hyundai maintains that growth has been broad-based. “GST has given a push, but we have seen growth across sectors,” Garg said, underlining that the overall market sentiment remains positive.\n\nHyundai’s own compact SUV offering, the Venue, reflects this trend. The model has garnered close to 80,000 bookings, underscoring strong consumer appetite for feature-rich, competitively priced SUVs in the sub-four-metre category.\n\nTata Nexon, Mahindra XUV3X0, Kia Sonet, Skoda Kylaq, Renault Kiger, Tata Punch, Hyundai Exter, Maruti Brezza and Kia Syros are some of the models in the sub 4-meter SUV segment. Last year the segment churned out 1.38 million units in sales.\n\nIndustry observers say the sustained rise of compact SUVs highlights a structural shift in buyer preferences, as customers increasingly favour higher ground clearance, perceived safety, and a more commanding driving position—benefits that compact SUVs offer at price points once dominated by hatchbacks and sedans.\n\nWith supportive policy measures like the GST cut and continued infrastructure development, automakers expect the compact SUV segment to remain a key growth driver in the Indian passenger vehicle market in the near term.",

While on Monday's trade, the yellow metal saw some recovery, it still warrants increased oversight, say sources.\n\nThe reason for concern is two-fold: the sharp surge in the outstanding gold loan portfolio and the much of the growth being front loaded by an increase in gold prices rather than an increase in tonnage of gold pledged with lenders. The shifting preference of lenders from unsecuredloansto gold-backed loans, especially in the smaller ticket sizes is also a cause of concern.\n\nFor instance, data published by India's top gold financiers - Muthoot Finance and Manappuram Finance suggest that the gold assets under management (AUM) for the former stood at Rs 1.25 lakh crore for the second quarter, recording a 40% on a year-on-year basis. Smaller peer Manappuram’s gold AUM stood at Rs 38,754 crore in the third quarter, posting a 58.2% growth from the prior corresponding period.\n\nOn the whole, bank loans against gold jewellery have surged to Rs 3.83 lakh crore, an whooping 86% rise during the financial year, according to latest data from the RBI report of sectoral deployment of bank credit.\n\n\"We are at the peak of the gold loans business,\" said a senior executive of a NBFC who didn't want to be named, adding that the downturn in the market conditions was waiting to happen. \"Any lending business is subject to a lot of cyclicality. When you lend against a commodity, the cyclicality tends to be higher,\" he added.\n\nSources also point out that the practice of top-up loans against the same collateral was found increasing in the last 12 months. \"It became particularly visible with smaller ticket sized loans and the ongoing cycle will indicate how many lenders are comfortable on the LTV front,\" said a banker who didn't want to be named. On October 23, 2025, Moneycontrolreportedthat lenders are getting cautious on gold loan borrowing limits\n\nLoan to value or LTV on gold loans ranges from 75 - 85 percent depending on the quantum of loan. For loans less than Rs 2 lakhs, the LTV is 85 percent, while for loans above Rs 5 lakhs, it stands at 75 percent.\n\nThe RBI is also monitoring whether the sharp fluctuations in gold prices is resulting in higher delinquencies as the available lending limits would automatically shrink necessitating pre-payment or part-repayment of loans. \"Are delinquencies and auctions of gold piling on is something that will be closely monitored especially after the recent price movements,\" said a source cited above.\n\nStock prices of gold-loan focussed NBFCs such as Muthoot Finance and Manappuram Finance have come under pressure in the recent trading sessions, having lost 8 percent and 6 percent respectively in the last three days of trading sessions.",

        "full_content": "Gold extended losses, after its biggest plunge in more than a decade on Friday, while silver’s year-to-date gains were wiped out as a record-breaking precious-metals rally unwound at breakneck speed.\n\nSpot gold fell as much as 10% on Monday and is now down almost a fifth from an all-time high reached in the last-but-one session. Silver slumped as much as 16%, following on from an intraday loss on Friday that was the steepest on record.\n\n“The bottom line is that the trade was way too crowded,” said Robert Gottlieb, a former precious metals trader at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and now an independent market commentator, adding that a reluctance to take further risks would constrain market liquidity.\n\nPrecious metals had risen to record highs that shocked even seasoned traders. An already-scorching rally accelerated sharply in January, as investors piled into gold and silver on renewed concerns about geopolitical turmoil, currency debasement and the Federal Reserve’s independence. A wave of buying from Chinese speculators added froth to the rally.\n\n“Most buyers who were already sitting on profits had one foot out the door, ready to exit at any moment,” said Jia Zheng, head of trading at Shanghai Soochow Jiuying Investment Management Co. The selloff has been driven largely by bullion-based exchange-traded funds, as well as leveraged derivatives, he said.\n\nThe extent to which Chinese investors buy the dips will play a key role in determining the direction of the market from here. While the Shanghai benchmark price extended losses after the market opened, it was still trading at a premium over the international price. Over the weekend, buyers flocked to the country’s biggest bullion marketplace in Shenzhen to stock up on gold jewelry and bars ahead of the Chinese New Year.\n\n“The combination of heightened volatility and the proximity of the Lunar New Year will prompt traders to trim positions and reduce risk,” said Zijie Wu, an analyst at Jinrui Futures Co. At the same time — particularly in peak buying season — the pullback in prices is likely to support retail demand in China, he said.\n\nChina’s domestic markets will be closed for just over a week from Feb. 16 for the holidays.\n\nThe trigger for Friday’s dramatic selloff was the news that US President Donald Trump will nominate Kevin Warsh to lead the Fed, which sent the dollar higher and undercut sentiment among investors who had bet on Trump’s willingness to let the currency weaken. Traders regard Warsh as the toughest inflation fighter among the final candidates, raising expectations of tighter monetary policy that would underpin the dollar and weaken greenback-priced bullion.\n\nBut precious metals had already been bracing for extreme moves, as soaring prices and volatility strained traders’ risk models and balance sheets. A record wave of purchases of call options — contracts which give holders the right to buy at a pre-determined price — were “mechanically reinforcing upward price momentum,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a note, as the sellers of the options were forced to adjust to rising prices by buying more.\n\n“This is a wholesale exit,” said Ole Sloth Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S. “The underlying fundamental support will only reassert itself once the selling is done and investors get a chance to look ahead again,” he said.\n\nThat fundamental support, however, hasn’t changed in the last few days and “gold’s thematic drivers remain positive,” Michael Hsueh, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, said in a note. “The conditions do not appear primed for a sustained reversal in gold prices,” he said, reiterating a target price of $6,000 an ounce.\n\nFor silver, the extent of the pullback took it below $71.66 an ounce — the level at which the white metal ended last year. Waves of hot money in China have contributed to domestic supply tightness, but that may subside as the rout damps investment demand, Wang Yanqing, an analyst at China Futures Co., said in a note. “Once the consensus expectation of a one-way rally is broken, shorts’ willingness to make delivery will increase, helping to ease the shortage,” he said.\n\nGold tumbled 7.3% to $4,536.46 an ounce as of 3:21 p.m. Singapore time. Silver lost 15% to $72.68. Platinum and palladium also retreated. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a gauge of the US currency, was up 0.1% after rising 0.9% in the previous session.",

        "full_content": "The rupee hit the biggest intraday gain in over six weeks during afternoon trade on February 2, thanks to the timely intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).\n\nThe domestic currency rebounded sharply during the afternoon session after sustained dollar selling by state-owned banks, widely seen as acting on behalf of the central bank, which helped ease volatility and stabilise market sentiment.\n\nAt 1:20 pm IST, the rupee was trading at 91.6087 against the US dollar, compared to 91.8060 at open and 91.99 at previous close against the greenback.\n\nThe rupee gained 42 paise on February 2  -- the highest level since December 19, 2025 -- when it appreciated 60 paise in a single day. In percentage terms, it is up 0.42 percent, compared to previous close.\n\n\"Today, RBI was present in the market from the beginning and ensured again that 92 is not breached,\" said Anil Kumar Bhansali, Head of Treasury and Executive Director Finrex Treasury Advisors LLP.\n\n“For the rupee, the budget offered reassurance, not relief. Short-term pressure may persist, but the broader message of fiscal credibility and growth continuity keeps medium-term prospects constructive,” Amit Pabari, MD, CR Forex Advisors, said.\n\nHowever, Michael Wan, senior currency analyst at MUFG Bank, remained negative on the rupee and see it underperforming through 2026. He said: \"We also think India's local currency rates will likely grind higher\".\n\n“The biggest takeaway from an INR FX and rates perspective is the slower-than-expected pace of fiscal consolidation (4.3 percent of GDP deficit in FY2026/27 from 4.4 percent previously), and with that larger-than-expected gross and net borrowing requirements of INR17.2 trillion and INR11.7 trillion (with INR5.5 trillion of repayment needs),” Wan said.\n\nHe added that bond markets in India were already struggling to absorb the current pace of State Development Bond issuances, with rising state government borrowing needs, given the sticky cash handout transfer programmes over the years. “As such, we think that RBI will likely have to inject more liquidity to cap bond yields or at least the pace of INR bond yield increases.”",

        "full_content": "For years, every Union Budget in India seemed to bring a fresh shake-up in the taxation of insurance products, especially life insurance and unit-linked insurance plans (ULIPs). However, Union Budget 2026, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1, broke that pattern. Unlike its predecessors, it did not announce any major tax reform specific to the insurance sector.\n\nThat silence itself, according to industry practitioners, may be the most significant signal of all. After years of iterative policy intervention, India’s insurance market may finally be moving past an era of regulatory realignment into one of relative stability.\n\nThere seems to be a sense of relief across the sector.\n\nThe January-March quarter is critical for insurers and typically accounts for 30-40 percent of annual business volumes. \"Policy stability during this period is important because any tax or regulatory disruption would have directly impacted growth momentum and year-end performance,\" an industry practitioner said on the condition of anonymity.\n\nAnother senior industry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the lack of tax changes was largely expected. “With risk-based capital (RBC) norms on the way, and the GST-cut that happened last year, the sector knew that there would be no major taxation changes. Everyone is preparing for the RBC regime, and any fresh tax restructuring would only complicate that transition,” the official said. \"What we did expect was clarity on regulatory developments such as third party motor premiums and composite licensing, but nothing particularly on taxation.\"\n\nA second executive echoed this view, noting that even Budget 2025 did not introduce substantive structural changes. “To be fair, the government did not technically make major changes in 2025 either, it was largely a clarification on ULIP taxation. The early signs of stabilisation began there. With the risk-based framework coming in, I don’t see the government introducing disruptive changes now,” the executive said.\n\nInsurance taxation timeline for the insurance sector\n\nBudget 2021: Introducing the ULIP premium cap\n\nThe seeds of long-term tax realignment were planted in Budget 2021. One of the most significant amendments was made to Section 10(10D) of the Income-tax Act, wherein the provision governing tax exemptions on life insurance maturity proceeds. Until then, most life insurance payouts were tax-exempt if the sum assured was at least ten times the annual premium. But in 2021, the government introduced a threshold for ULIPs: only policies with aggregate annual premiums up to Rs 2.5 lakh would remain eligible for this exemption. ULIPs above this level were excluded from Section 10(10D) relief, although their precise tax treatment initially remained ambiguous. The intent was clear, which was to limit the tax-driven use of ULIPs, which had increasingly become investment vehicles rather than protection products.\n\nBudget 2022: Implicit consolidation\n\nBudget 2022 did not introduce major headline tax changes for the insurance sector. The policy framework set in 2021 continued, and the sector largely absorbed the ULIP reforms and Section 10(10D) changes. This period marked a phase of relative continuity, with no significant new tax interventions for insurance.\n\nBudget 2023: Tightening high-value life policy exemptions\n\nIn Budget 2023, the government tightened the regime further by withdrawing tax exemptions under Section 10(10D) for high-value traditional life insurance policies where annual premiums exceeded Rs 5 lakh. This meant that not only ULIPs, but also non-market-linked, high-premium life insurance policies that had historically enjoyed tax-free maturity proceeds, could now become taxable beyond the new thresholds. The move aimed to curb the misuse of insurance products as tax-arbitrage instruments and bring them closer in parity with other investment avenues.\n\nBudget 2024: TDS relief for policyholders\n\nBy Budget 2024, the narrative began shifting from restriction to operational relief. The government reduced Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on life insurance payouts from 5 percent to 2 percent. This provided direct cash-flow relief to policyholders receiving maturity or surrender proceeds.\n\nFor everyday retail customers, the move improved net realisations on insurance payouts and helped ease friction in claims and settlement processes.\n\nBudget 2025: Clarity on ULIP taxation\n\nBudget 2025 delivered the most consequential clarification for the sector in recent years by resolving long-standing ambiguity around ULIP taxation. The finance ministry clarified that ULIPs not qualifying for Section 10(10D) exemption, where annual premiums exceed Rs 2.5 lakh, would be treated as capital assets. On redemption, gains from such policies would be taxed as capital gains, not as income from other sources. For policies held beyond 12 months, long-term capital gains tax at 12.5 percent would apply, aligning ULIP taxation with equity mutual funds. This effectively removed regulatory arbitrage between ULIPs and mutual funds and pushed the sector towards uniform tax treatment for market-linked products.\n\n2025 GST Council reforms: Zero GST on individual policies\n\nAlthough outside the Union Budget process, the GST Council’s decision in late 2025 to reduce GST on individual life and health insurance policies to 0 percent from 18 percent marked a major fiscal shift for the sector. The move aimed to boost affordability and penetration, and insurance stocks responded positively. However, it also created unintended consequences, where intermediaries lost input tax credits, forcing brokers and insurers to restructure commissions and distribution economics.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Budget 2026’s absence of insurance-specific tax changes becomes meaningful. While income tax laws were amended, including the transition toward a new Income Tax Act effective April 1, 2026, there were no provisions targeting life insurance, ULIPs, or insurance taxation.\n\nAn executive added, \"With ULIP taxation aligned to capital markets, TDS reduced, and GST exemptions improving affordability, insurers can now focus on core business fundamentals such as expanding coverage, improving product relevance, strengthening distribution, and building trust, rather than redesigning products in response to fiscal changes.\"",

        "full_content": "Cigarette prices have risen sharply after the new excise duty regime came into force, with a pack of 10 sticks now costing at least Rs 22-25 more than earlier. The hike follows the government's decision to increase taxes on cigarettes for the first time in nearly seven years, a move aimed at aligning India's tobacco taxation framework more closely with global public health standards.\n\nThe revised levies, cleared by Parliament in December, replace the GST compensation cess system that had been in place since the rollout of the Goods and Services Tax in July 2017. From February 2026, cigarettes and other tobacco products will attract additional excise duty and cess over and above the highest 40% GST slab.\n\nPrice increases vary depending on the length and category of cigarettes. Distributors said premium cigarettes of 76 mm length are now likely to be priced Rs 50-55 higher per pack of 10 sticks, depending on the brand. It should be noted that cigarette manufacturers have yet not formally announce revised maximum retail prices. However, distributors have begun billing existing stock to retailers under the new tax structure, charging 40% GST.\n\nWith wholesale markets closed on Sunday, distributors expect fresh supplies carrying updated MRPs to be lifted from Monday. News agency PTI reported that a pack of Wills Navy Cut (76 mm), which earlier sold for Rs 95 per 10 sticks, is expected to be priced at around Rs 120. Cigarettes of 84 mm length-such as Gold Flake Kings and Lights, Wills Classic and Wills Classic Milds-currently retailing at Rs 170 per pack, are likely to cost between Rs 220 and Rs 225.\n\nSlim cigarettes are also set to become costlier. PTI said a pack of Classic Connect (97 mm), priced at Rs 300 for 20 sticks, is expected to carry an MRP of about Rs 350.\n\nDistributors, however, have flagged concerns that the steep price hikes could fuel smuggling and the circulation of counterfeit products. The All India Cigarette and Tobacco Distributors Federation (AICPDF) estimates that there are around 8,000-9,000 stockists of cigarettes and tobacco products across India. A stockist told PTI that some companies have temporarily held back supplies and are expected to resume dispatches once billing under the new tax regime begins.\n\n\"Tobacco products are among the few categories where small shopkeepers still have a meaningful role. If this segment is pushed into the hands of illicit operators, it threatens the survival of honest retailers. This is not only a tax issue but also a livelihood concern,\" the stockist said.\n\nAs part of the overhaul, the Central Excise Act has been amended to introduce a per-stick excise duty on cigarettes, with rates linked to the length of the product, replacing the earlier cess-based system.",

The board is scheduled to meet on February 6 to approve the financial results for the quarter ended December 2025 and is also likely to decide on the formation of the committee.\n\nShares of NSE are trading at about Rs 2,150 in the unlisted market, according to Incredmoney.com, implying a valuation of about Rs 5.3 lakh crore ($58 billion), making it the world’s fourth-most valuable exchange among listed peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe committee’s mandate is expected to include assisting the board in appointing investment bankers, negotiating fees, determining the amount of shares to be sold by existing investors, and filing the draft prospectus. The exchange is targeting a timeline of about three months for the filing, the person added.\n\nDeliberations are ongoing and key details could still change, the person said. Spokespeople for NSE, LIC, SBI, and SBI Capital Market didn’t respond to requests for comment. Temasek declined to comment.\n\nOn Friday, NSE said it had received regulatory clearance to begin preparations for an IPO. The approval comes nearly a decade after it first filed for a listing in 2016, a plan that stalled following allegations of corporate governance lapses and unfair market access raised by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. NSE subsequently filed two settlement applications related to the case, proposing to pay close to Rs 1,300 crore.",

Gold futures for April 2, 2026 delivery also declined, slipping Rs 4,252, or 3%, to Rs 1,43,501 per 10 grams.The previous session had seen even steeper losses. MCX silver futures plunged Rs 26,273, or 9%, to end at Rs 2,65,652 per kg, while April gold futures fell Rs 4,592, or 3%, to close at Rs 1,47,753 per 10 grams.In global markets, spot gold was down 3.3% at $4,703.27 an ounce as of 0259 GMT, after tumbling over 5% earlier in the day to its lowest level in more than two weeks. Bullion had surged to an all-time high of $5,594.82 on Thursday. Spot silver, however, gained 1.6% to $85.98 an ounce, though it remained well below its lifetime peak of $121.64 hit last week.The US dollar held firm as investors evaluated the potential policy direction of the Federal Reserve under Kevin Warsh, who is widely viewed as favouring a leaner balance sheet. A stronger dollar typically pressures gold prices, as it makes the dollar-denominated metal costlier for holders of other currencies.Heightened volatility in bullion markets has been fuelled by speculation around US monetary policy following Warsh's nomination as the next Fed chair by President Donald Trump. The development has bolstered the greenback and weighed on precious metals.How should you trade gold?Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvi Finmart told the Ecgold and silver are experiencing unusually high volatility. He noted that silver could find support near $65 per troy ounce, while gold may defend the $4,440 level on a weekly closing basis. Jain expects near-term price action to remain choppy, driven by movements in the dollar index and persistent geopolitical uncertainties.According to him, gold has support in the $4,680-4,620 range and faces resistance between $4,800 and $4,910 per troy ounce. Silver, meanwhile, has support at $67-74 and resistance at $84-88.80 per troy ounce in today's trade.On the domestic front, MCX gold is seen finding support at Rs 1,44,400-1,37,700, with resistance at Rs 1,48,800-1,54,000. Silver support is placed at Rs 2,55,500-2,44,000, while resistance lies at Rs 2,78,000-2,92,000. Jain advised investors to wait for clearer stability in bullion markets before taking fresh positions.",

This implies a 26 percent drop (around Rs 50,000) after hitting a fresh lifetime high of Rs 1,93,096 per 10 grams on Thursday.\n\nGold futures with June and February expiries meanwhile fell more than 4 percent and around 3 percent, respectively.\n\nSilver futures with March expiry meanwhile fell 6 percent to Rs 2,49,713 per kilogram.

Axis Silver ETF also crashed 20 percent, while UTI Silver ETF, DSP Silver ETF, Aditya Birla Sun Life Silver ETF,Kotak Silver ETFand few others tumbled around 20 percent each.\n\nMirae Asset Silver ETF, Motilal Oswal Silver ETF, 360 ONE Silver ETF,HDFC Silver ETFand few others fell nearly 19 percent, while ICICI Prudential Silver ETF, Nippon India Silver ETF, SBI Silver ETF, Tata Silver ETF plunged around 18 percent each.\n\nAmong the gold ETFs, Birla Sun Life Gold ETF and Motilal Oswal Gold ETF crashed more than 9 percent each, whileICICI Prudential Gold ETF, Mirae Asset Gold ETF and others fell around 8 percent each.

US President Donald Trump said he had chosen former ⁠Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, who is known to be hawkish and rigid about rate cuts, to ⁠head ⁠the American central bank.\n\nAdditionally, CME Group announced hikes in margins on its metal futures on Saturday and the changes are set to take effect after market close on Monday. This will also likely weigh on precious metals. COMEX gold futures ⁠margins have been raised from 6 percent to 8 percent, while COMEX 5000 silver futures are set to increase to 15 percent ‍from 11 percent.\n\nThe recent \"flash crash\" in gold and silver, triggered by a hawkish US Fed nominee and increased margin requirements, is viewed by many as a necessary cooling of \"overbought\" markets rather than a trend reversal, said Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza.\n\nHe however noted that the long-term outlook remains structurally bullish, despite the volatility. “Record central bank buying, silver’s persistent supply deficit, and geopolitical tensions provide a solid floor,” he said.\n\n“We have maintained a cautious stance on silver following its parabolic move and have suggested trimming overallocation to precious metals to realign portfolios with long-term strategic allocation levels. While it is prudent to wait for further information and trend confirmation, we currently prefer gold from a relative risk-reward perspective,” said Siddharth Srivastava, Head - ETF Product & Fund Manager, Mirae Asset Investment Mangers (India).\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

When the dollar gains value, it becomes more expensive for individuals and institutions using other currencies to purchase the same amount of gold, which tends to reduce demand and thus the price.\n\nThe price of gold has sharply corrected after the US Fed kept the rates unchanged at 3.5-3.75 percent during the January policy meeting. US President Donald Trump has nominated Kevin Warsh as the next chair of the US Federal Reserve, set to take over when Jerome Powell’s four-year term ends in May.\n\nTraders are now pricing in a further accommodative stance, which has supported their prices.

When the dollar gains value, it becomes more expensive for individuals and institutions using other currencies to purchase the same amount of gold, which tends to reduce demand and thus the price.\n\nGold prices vary by purity. Check the prices of gold based on its purity:\n\nCity-wise gold prices in India today\n\nGold rates across India’s major cities showed remarkable uniformity, with only marginal differences due to local taxes, jeweller margins, and logistics costs.\n\nThe price of gold has sharply corrected after the US Fed kept the rates unchanged at 3.5-3.75 percent during the January policy meeting. US President Donald Trump has nominated Kevin Warsh as the next chair of the US Federal Reserve, set to take over when Jerome Powell’s four-year term ends in May.\n\nTraders are now pricing in a further accommodative stance, which has supported their prices. The geopolitical tensions added fuel as US-Iran relations intensified over a nuclear program. The prices are also up amid the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, the crisis in Gaza, Trump’s tariff threats, and the dollar’s strength.\n\nThe Augmont Bullion report, published on January 29, said that gold’s strong support is at $5,200 (Rs 160,000), a break could trigger profit-booking toward $5,000–$4,750.",

        "full_content": "Budget 2026 has raised Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on futures and options trades, a move that increases transaction costs in the derivatives market. While the hike may appear marginal, it has meaningful implications for arbitrage funds, which rely heavily on cash-futures spreads. The impact on multi-asset strategies is expected to remain limited.\n\nIn her Budget for 2026-27,  finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has proposed to raise STT on futures from 0.02 percent to 0.05 percent, while on options premium and option exercise it will be increased to 0.15 percent from 0.10 percent. The change increases the cost of rolling and churning positions, which forms the backbone of arbitrage strategies.\n\nArbitrage funds: returns take a small but visible hit\n\nArbitrage funds typically generate returns by simultaneously buying equities in the cash market and selling futures to capture price differentials. Since these trades are executed at scale and rolled over frequently, even small increases in STT can shave off returns.\n\nAccording to estimates shared by Edelweiss Mutual Fund in a Budget note, the incremental increase in STT could lead to an annualised impact of around 0.32 percentage points on arbitrage fund returns. This assumes an average arbitrage exposure of about 70 percent and churn in roughly 20 percent of the portfolio.\n\nWhile the absolute impact may seem modest, it matters for a category where returns are already closely aligned to liquid fund yields. -\n\nPost-tax, the return differential between arbitrage funds and liquid funds is expected to narrow further. The note suggests that if liquid funds deliver around 7 percent, the post-tax return gap between arbitrage and liquid funds could compress to about 0.90 percentage points, compared with over 1.2 percentage points earlier.\n\nWhile liquid funds are taxed at 30 percent, arbitrage funds are taxed at 12.5 percent for long-term gain.\n\n“The sharp STT hike on futures will trim arbitrage fund returns by around 30 bps annually, narrowing their yield edge over liquid and ultra-short funds. While arbitrage funds remain low-volatility and tax-efficient, long-term investors are likely to stay focused on core equity strategies rather than short-term parking tools,\" said \"Anup Bhaiya, Founder Money Honey Financial Services.\n\nMulti-asset funds: impact remains muted\n\nThe impact on multi-asset allocation funds is less pronounced. These strategies typically have much lower exposure to pure arbitrage trades and rely more on directional equity, debt, or alternative strategies.\n\nThe Edelweiss MF, for instance, highlights that a multi-asset allocation fund with an average equity arbitrage exposure of around 25 percent would see an impact of about 0.08 percent on annual returns due to the STT hike.\n\nArbitrage funds may deliver slightly lower post-tax returns, but they continue to offer lower volatility and equity taxation benefits when held for the long term. Multi-asset funds remain largely insulated from the change.",

        "full_content": "The Budget 2026 has laid down more than just numbers for the banking industry. It signalled intent for a deeper transformation of India’s financial architecture.\n\nIn an economy that has weathered volatile global conditions, the policy thrust this year seeks to balance stability with forward-looking reform, anchoring the banking sector as a linchpin for sustainable growth.\n\nThe key part is the announcement of a high-level committee on Banking for Viksit Bharat. Presenting the Budget on February 1, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman made it clear that Indian banks, with strong balance sheets, improved asset quality and record profitability, are now poised for the next phase of evolution.\n\nThe committee will review the structure, efficiency and readiness of the banking system to support India’s growth aspirations while safeguarding financial stability, inclusion and customer protection.\n\nIt could lay the groundwork for structural reforms that go beyond incremental tweaks, encompassing governance, risk management and technological adoption.\n\nAnother important strand of the Budget 2026 was the focus on non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). The roadmap for NBFCs, particularly in the public sector, includes clear credit disbursement targets and a push for greater technological integration.\n\nThe first step towards this vision is the proposed restructuring of major public sector NBFCs, beginning with Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and Rural Electrification Corporation (REC), aimed at building scale and efficiency in development financing.\n\nThe government has also introduced measures to deepen financial markets. By reviewing foreign investment norms under the Foreign Exchange Management (non-debt instruments) Rules and raising investment limits for Non-Resident Indians under the Portfolio Investment Scheme, the Budget seeks to widen the investor base for Indian equities and attract stable capital inflows.\n\nSimilarly, incentives for large municipal bond issuances and steps towards a market-making framework for corporate bonds tell of an intent to expand alternative sources of credit for infrastructure and urban financing.\n\nHowever, there are trade-offs too. Hikes in transaction taxes and tweaks in market-linked levies, while aimed at curbing speculation and ensuring fiscal stability, may initially dampen trading volumes and affect profitability for intermediaries.\n\nFor the banking sector, Budget 2026 is not about short-term giveaways. It is a carefully calibrated vision that emphasises institutional strength, greater inclusivity and the scaffolding for a more resilient and market-oriented financial system.\n\nIf executed well, these measures can enhance credit access, improve resource allocation and position Indian banking as a robust platform for the growth India aspires to achieve by 2047.",

        "full_content": "This Budget is a continuation of the economic reforms process of the previous years, with the objective of achieving higher, sustained economic growth, and realizing the vision of Viksit Bharat by 2047. Despite the challenges to the economy from global policy resets and lower capital flows, the economy has been able to clock a real growth of 8% in H1FY26. However, the growth is seen slowing in FY27, with the Economic Survey having put out a broad range of 6.8-7.2% for the year.\n\nOn the other hand, the Economic Survey did mention the fact that the potential growth of the economy is now at 7%, up from 6.5% and this was made possible by the economic reforms process.\n\nUnderlying assumptions are sound\n\nThe basic assumptions of the Budget seem to be in order. First, the Budget math assumes a 10% nominal growth, up from 8% in FY26. This is likely to be beneficial from the perspective of tax collections, that heavily depend on the nominal growth of the economy.\n\nThe fiscal consolidation strategy also stays intact despite challenges towards allocating more funds for States under the Finance Commission. After sticking to the target of 4.4% for FY26, the Budget targets 4.3% Gross Fiscal Deficit as % of GDP. The borrowing programme of the Central Government is a tad on the higher side at Rs 17.2 trillion but should be manageable as we anticipate the RBI to continue with its OMO purchases of Government Securities to support banking sector liquidity.\n\nPotential of financial reforms\n\nThe Budget talks of building up a robust and resilient financial sector as one of its objectives. The importance of this lies in mobilizing savings and allocating capital efficiently and managing risks. The Budget announces the setting up of a “High Level Committee on Banking for Viksit Bharat” to review the sector and align it with India’s next phase of growth. While there are no concrete steps laid out, there is a proposal to review the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-debt instruments) Rules, to enable a user-friendly framework for foreign investments. The Budget targets to create more depth in the corporate bond market and envisages to kickstart issuance of higher value municipal bonds by placing an incentive of Rs 100 crore for a single bond issuance of more than Rs 1000 crore.\n\nThese announcements are in line with the concerns placed in the Economic Survey that India suffers from high cost of capital due to relatively shallow corporate bond markets, limited institutional investor depth, and regulatory restrictions on capital flows.\n\nThe Budget speaks of the government’s decision to place a renewed emphasis on the services sector to provide a pathway to fulfilling the aspirations of a youthful India. Towards this objective, the Budget announced the setting up of a “Education to Employment and Enterprise” Standing Committee to prioritize areas to optimize the potential for growth, employment and exports.\n\nFurther, to attract global investments in data centres into India, a tax holiday was provided to the sector till 2047 to foreign companies that provide cloud services to customers globally by using data centres services from India.\n\nApart from the services sector, there was a focus on legacy industries whereby the Budget proposes the scaling up of manufacturing in “7 strategic and frontier sectors”, that is sought through a push to the semiconductor industry through India Semiconductor Mission 2.0 to fortify supply chains, develop technology and skilled workforce and an enhancement in the outlay for the Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme (launched in April 2025). The Budget also envisages to boost production of high value and technologically advanced Construction and Infrastructure Equipment (CIE).\n\nPotential of a rare earth corridor\n\nAn underlying theme in the Budget was also to create self-reliance for the Indian economy from the vagaries of global supply chain challenges. The semiconductor and electronics manufacturing, and CIE serve this purpose. Further, there was a thought process for developing self-reliance in Rare Earth minerals. A scheme for Rare Earth Permanent Magnet was launched in November 2025 and the Budget now proposes to support the mineral-rich States to establish dedicated Rare Earth Corridors to promote mining, processing, research and manufacturing.\n\nThe Budget also attempts to address the strains at the labour-intensive sectors due to the US tariffs. Importantly, there is an attempt to promote globally competitive and sustainable textiles and apparels through capital support for machinery and technological upgradation of traditional clusters. The other area that has found significant mention is MSME-focused measures – the Budget provides for an equity support to the SMEs via a dedicated Rs 10,000 crore SME Growth Fund and also announces important measures under the TReDS – (a) making it a transaction settlement platform for all purchases from MSMEs by CPSEs and (b) TReDs receivables can be used as asset-backed securities to enhance liquidity and settlement of transactions.\n\nDevelopment is a continuous process\n\nOverall, India’s development process is not just about a single Budget. It remains a process whereby the attempt of the government will have to be on continued structural reforms with a critical focus on employment generation, skill redevelopment, harnessing technological developments and making domestic manufacturing productive, create value within the agriculture sector etc. On all these counts, the Budget scores a high mark that should enable the economy to achieve a sustainable 7% growth and also push for higher growth trajectories in the medium-term.\n\n(Prashant Kumar is Managing Director & CEO, YES BANK.)\n\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "The report of the 16th Finance Commission was tabled in parliament along with the Union Budget 2026-27. The approach of the Commission and some of its recommendations are tangibly different from the previous finance commissions.\n\nDiscontinuation of Revenue need grants under Article 275\n\nDeparting from the practice and principles set by the preceding 15 finance commissions that the 16th edition of the constitutionally mandated finance commission, chose to discontinue grants-in-aid for revenue needs of states. The phrase used by Article 275 (1) of the Constitution is “… Parliament may by law provide…grants-in-aid of the revenues of such states as Parliament may determine to be in need of assistance.”.This exercise of determining needs of states is to be conducted by the finance commission on behalf of the Parliament.\n\nNo details of any such assessment of state finances in the projection period of the commission are available from the report. Even if the assessment is that no state is inany need of assistance, such a recommendation should have been based on a detailed examination and assessment of state finances.\n\nThe FC16 has argued that it has discontinued this grant since the aggregate revenue deficit of states was only 0.3% of GDP in the post-Covid years that is 2022-23 and 2023-24 (paragraph 9.48 of the Report of FC16). This argument presumes that such aggregation is meaningful. In fact, Article 275 is about individual states and it is not meaningful to argue that the revenue deficits of some states can be offset by revenue surplus of other states since surplus states do not transfer revenues to deficit states.\n\nThe commission has also not recommended any state-specific or sector-specific grants. All these three grants have been historically meant for catering to the individual needs of states and their cost differentials which cannot be properly captured by a broad-based scheme of tax devolution.\n\nChanges in inter-se shares of tax devolution\n\nThe commission continued with most of the historically used devolution criteria. It however, introduced one additional criterion whereby contribution of a state nominal GSDP to nominal GDP was given a weight of 10%. This is an incentive criterion meant to encourage states to show higher nominal growth.\n\nNot all states are equally placed in attracting capital\n\nThis implies that GDP growth in a state takes place due to the growth effort of a state. In fact, it largely depends on the inter-state movement of capital and availability of capital stock. Many states have natural advantages including location of ports which leads to increased economic and trade activities. Many landlocked states have natural disadvantages including hilly terrain and historically disadvantaged segments of population.\n\nAvailable data on inter-state allocation of capital stock which includes private and government capital stock shows considerable concentration in a narrow geographical belt covering already developed western and southern states with some exceptions. Market drivers where the free movement of financial savings in a common market in our federal setup provides this comparative advantage to already developed states. With a higher per-capita GSDP, they get a built-in reward in terms of per-capita own tax revenues even if the tax effort is the same.\n\nPerforming fiscal surgery through blunt instruments\n\nThe underlying assumption of relying on tax devolution as the core transfer channel is that a limited set of criteria can provide the fine targeting that is needed to cater to the needs and cost conditions of India’s highly differentiated states in terms of population, geographical and other features. The sole reliance on a limited set of broad-based criteria amounts to performing a fiscal surgery by using extremely blunt instruments. It is doubtful that the scheme of the Commission can deliver adequate fiscal equalization which is the guiding principle of most established federations such as Australia and Canada.\n\nIn fact, the earlier Indian finance Commissions had a similar scheme of devolution but a considerably detailed assessment process. In Australia and Canada also, it is the assessment of the needs of the states on a normative basis which is undertaken first in relation to its tax effort. Such an assessment ensures that no state is rewarded for deficiency in tax effort whereas any deficiency in fiscal capacity is made up. In fact, they assess the gap first and then either give it as grants or convert those into shares. The tax devolution exercise of the kind that is undertaken in India remains incomplete without a framework of overall assessment of needs and unit costs of providing public services by the states.\n\nStates with lower fiscal capacity stand to lose\n\nIt is no surprise therefore, that many of the larger and lower fiscal capacity states stand to lose sometimes by relatively tangible margins in the scheme of transfers recommended by the FC16 as compared to FC15. Some of these states are Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, Meghalaya, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Nagaland, Manipur and Tamil Nadu.\n\n-With inputs from Tarrung Kapur, Senior Manager, Tax and Economic Policy Group, EY India.\n\n(DK Srivastava is Chief Policy Advisor, EY India.)\n\nViews expressed are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "The Union Budget 2026’s proposal to create City Economic Regions (CERs) is expected to open up new real estate growth corridors across Tier-2 and 3 cities along with temple towns, as the government looks to drive region-based urban development backed by assured, multi-year infrastructure funding.\n\nMarket observers said that the move is set to reshape urban growth and real estate demand beyond metros. The focus on temple towns and tourism-led economies is likely to spur residential, rental housing and retail development, while industrial and logistics-led CERs could drive demand for worker housing, industrial parks and support infrastructure.\n\nUnion Finance MinisterNirmala Sitharamanon February 1 said cities are India’s engines of growth and that the government will now focus on smaller cities and temple towns that require modern infrastructure and basic amenities to unlock their economic potential.\n\nAccording to government officials, under the plan, CERs will be mapped based on specific growth drivers—such as manufacturing, logistics, services, education and tourism—to harness the economic power of agglomeration.\n\n“Each City Economic Region will receive Rs 5,000 crore over five years, with funds released through a challenge mode and a reform-cum-results based financing mechanism, encouraging states and urban local bodies to accelerate infrastructure creation, connectivity and civic upgrades,” officials said.\n\nReal estate developers said the CER framework could unlock planned urban expansion, driving demand for housing, commercial spaces, mixed-use projects and hospitality assets in emerging cities.\n\nPradeep Aggarwal, Founder & Chairman, Signature Global (India) Ltd, said that urban development receives a sustained boost with an allocation of Rs 5,000 crore per year for five years for City Economic Regions, alongside a continued focus on Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities as emerging growth centres.\n\n“These measures will enable planned urbanisation, support civic infrastructure, and unlock housing demand across new geographies,” he said.\n\nGurpal Singh Chawla, Managing Director, TREVOC Group, said that the sustained emphasis on capital expenditure and urban infrastructure in this Budget reinforces the government’s commitment to long-term economic growth.\n\n“The introduction of the City Economic Regions framework, with dedicated funding for Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, is a structured step towards improving connectivity, civic amenities and economic activity beyond metros. While immediate demand impact may be limited; this structural focus will gradually strengthen real estate fundamentals in emerging urban centres,” he said.\n\nExperts said that the focus on smaller cities and religious centres is also likely to accelerate residential and rental housing demand, while supporting retail and hospitality development around tourism-led economies.\n\nShift to region-based planning\n\nIndustry experts view CERs as a shift towards region-based urban planning, enabling better land use, transit-oriented development and infrastructure-led real estate growth, while easing pressure on overcrowded metros.\n\nManik Malik, CEO, BPTP said that the emphasis on infrastructure-led expansion across Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities is expected to support orderly urban growth and strengthen regional market fundamentals over time.\n\n“The continued focus on infrastructure creation, economic stability, and spatial development corridors provides a constructive policy backdrop for stakeholders across the real estate ecosystem, including developers, lenders, and homebuyers,” he said.\n\nExperts said that if implemented effectively, could strengthen real estate fundamentals in emerging markets over the medium to long term.\n\nAditya Goel, Co-Founder, One Prastha Group, said that focusing on development in tier-2 cities, would help in further expansion of amenities for the customers and promote a healthy and sustainable environment for developers as well as the customers.\n\n“Sustained capital expenditure and emphasis on infrastructure-led growth, urban development will further boost employment and strengthen the organisation of the sector,” he said.",

        "full_content": "Gold fell, following its biggest plunge in more than a decade, and silver whipsawed in choppy trading after a dramatic pullback from record highs.\n\nSpot gold fell as much as 6.3% on Monday. Silver swung sharply, dropping to around $75 an ounce having earlier climbed as much as 3.2%. The white metal recorded its biggest ever intraday loss in the previous session.\n\n“This isn’t over,” said Robert Gottlieb, a former precious metals trader at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and now an independent market commentator, adding that a reluctance to take further risk would constrain market liquidity. “We’ve got to see if it’s going to find support. The bottom line is that the trade was way too crowded.”\n\nOver the last year, precious metals have risen to all-time highs that have shocked even seasoned traders. The rally accelerated sharply in January, as investors piled into gold and silver on renewed concerns about geopolitical upheaval, currency debasement and the independence of the Federal Reserve. A wave of buying from Chinese speculators added froth to the rally.\n\nThe trigger for Friday’s dramatic selloff was the news that US President Donald Trump would nominate Kevin Warsh to lead the Fed, which sent the dollar higher and undercut sentiment among investors who had bet on Trump’s willingness to let the currency weaken. Traders regard Warsh as the toughest inflation fighter among the final candidates, raising expectations of monetary policy that would underpin the dollar and weaken greenback-priced bullion.\n\nBut precious metals had already been primed for extreme moves, as soaring prices and volatility strained traders’ risk models and balance sheets. A record wave of purchases of call options — contracts which give holders the right to buy at a pre-determined price — were “mechanically reinforcing upward price momentum,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a note, as the sellers of the options hedged their exposure to rising prices by buying more.\n\nGold fell 4.4% to $4,680.76 an ounce as of 9:21 a.m. Singapore time. Silver declined 2.2% to $83.2965. Platinum and palladium declined. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a gauge of the US currency, rose 0.1% after gaining 0.9% in the previous session.",

        "full_content": "Markets endured sharp volatility last week (ended on January 30) on US shutdown risks and President Trump’s Fed chair pick, with commodity markets experiencing especially violent price swings.\n\nThe US dollar initially slipped to a four-year low near 95.5 earlier in the week, weighed down by President Trump’s dismissal of dollar weakness, comments that the currency’s value remains strong, and speculation around possible yen intervention involving the US. However, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s dismissal of coordinated currency intervention, rising US Treasury yields, and hotter-than-expected PPI data helped the greenback recover.\n\nThe major upside catalyst came on Friday after the Trump administration nominated Kevin Warsh, widely regarded as an inflation hawk, as the next Federal Reserve Chair, hurt rate-cut expectations, pushing the dollar index above 97 and trimming its weekly losses to just 0.5% and weighing on US equities.\n\nPrecious metals witnessed an exceptionally brutal correction. COMEX gold and silver posted their steepest single-day declines since 1980 on Friday, settling at $4,713.9 per troy ounce and $78.53 per ounce, respectively. The sell-off followed an extraordinary rally, with gold hitting a fresh all-time high of $5,626 on Thursday and silver peaking at $121.78, supported by a weaker dollar and persistent geopolitical tensions. Silver saw a deeper correction due to its higher volatility, greater exposure to industrial demand, and potentially from the CME’s margin hike announced on Wednesday (January 28).\n\nThe sharp rebound in the US dollar and the shift toward a more hawkish Fed outlook accelerated profit-taking across the metals complex including base metals.\n\nSilverRate in Mumbai Yesterday\n\nA delayed LME opening due to a potential technical issue further added to trader anxiety. Copper ended the week marginally higher above $13,150 per tonne after briefly touching a record high of $14,528 per tonne earlier driven by strong demand for real assets amid escalating geopolitical risks, renewed US–Iran tensions, and persistent trade uncertainty. Aluminium and lead closed with marginal losses, while zinc outperformed with weekly gains of 4.4%.\n\nIn contrast, the energy complex stood out as the top performer. WTI crude hovered near six-month highs before closing above $65 per barrel on Friday, as risks of US military action and possible Iranian retaliation, particularly affecting shipments through the Strait of Hormuz, which accounts for roughly one-fifth of global crude flows, kept risk premiums elevated. Oil prices may remain supported as markets track US–Iran tensions, even as President Trump suggested Iran may seek negotiations rather than confrontation, while Tehran reiterated that its missile defense systems would “never” be part of any deal.\n\nMCX Crude oil futures witnessed the gains of more than 6% throughout the recent week. Price has breached out of a base after breaking above the symmetrical triangle on weekly chart. The fourth consecutive weekly gains confirm the bullish stance in the counter. On the daily chart, price has been continuously holding above the 100 EMA and other medium term averages suggesting that the short-term bullish bias remains intact.\n\nAs long as MCX Crude oil futures price stays above the immediate support of Rs 5,600 per barrel, it could move higher in the coming week toward the initial resistance at Rs 6,300 per barrel. A breakout and sustained trade above this level could accelerate the momentum towards Rs 6,800 and further towards Rs 7,300. However, a break below Rs 5,600 could pause the current momentum and send the counter in a sideways bias.\n\nNatural gas also bucked the broader commodity sell-off. NYMEX and MCX gas futures surged more than 10% on Friday, taking weekly gains to over 20%, driven by colder-than-expected weather forecasts for early February that could lead to further inventory draws.\n\nDuring India’s Union Budget session on Sunday, selling pressure intensified on MCX, with gold and silver hitting lower circuits and sliding nearly 9% intraday, compounding Friday’s sharp losses of 17% in gold and 27% in silver. Gold subsequently recovered sharply and erased most of its losses, while silver continued to lag. Since customs duty rates on gold and silver imports were left unchanged in the budget, the latter half of the session saw limited reaction.\n\nLooking ahead, further downside pressure on precious metals may emerge early in the week as higher CME margins come into effect on Monday, February 2. Markets will prioritize the US jobs report for clues on the timing of the next Federal Reserve rate cut, with current expectations pricing out any easing until Jerome Powell’s term ends in May. Additionally, policy decisions from the Bank of England and the European Central Bank will be in focus, though both are widely expected to remain on hold. The impact of the partial US government shutdown that began on January 31 is currently seen as limited.",

        "full_content": "The benchmark indices succumbed to selling pressure following the Union Budget announcement, falling nearly 2 percent on February 1, with weakness visible in market breadth. A total of 1,940 shares declined, against 953 advancing shares on the NSE. The market may consolidate near the previous day’s low after the sharp correction. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:\n\nVinay Rajani, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities\n\nThe primary trend of Infosys remains bullish, with the stock forming higher tops and higher bottoms. Infosys is trading above all key moving averages, and the IT sector has shown resilience during the recent market fall.\n\nMax Healthcare Institute| CMP: Rs 976.7\n\nMax Healthcare has formed a double bottom reversal pattern near Rs 940. The stock has closed above its 5-day EMA, while the daily RSI has exited the oversold zone, indicating a potential bullish trend reversal.\n\nAditya Birla Capital| CMP: Rs 329.2\n\nAditya Birla Capital has breached crucial support levels of its 20- and 50-day EMAs with healthy volume. The stock has also broken down from a consolidation pattern. The weekly RSI has exited the overbought zone, confirming a downward reversal. Sell Aditya Birla Capital February Futures.\n\nRupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities\n\nLTIMindtree has delivered a consolidation breakout on the daily chart, indicating rising optimism around the counter. The sector looks favourable for the short to medium term, as post-Budget, IT remains the only sector holding on to its gains. Additionally, the stock has closed above the 20-day DMA, confirming a positive bias. Based on the technical setup, the stock could move toward the Rs 6,400–6,600 zone, while on the downside, support is placed at Rs 5,900.\n\nAster DM Healthcare| CMP: Rs 570.40\n\nAster DM Healthcare appears to be forming a base ahead of a recovery on the daily chart after a sharp correction over the past several weeks. Recently, it found support near the previous congestion zone, strengthening the bullish case. A minor positive divergence is also visible on the daily chart. Overall, the setup points toward a smart recovery in the short term, with potential to move toward Rs 600.\n\nAxis Bank has formed a bearish engulfing pattern on the daily chart, indicating waning bullish momentum and the likelihood of additional selling pressure in the short term. Additionally, the RSI has formed a negative divergence near the overbought zone. The trend is expected to remain weak, with potential downside toward Rs 1,270. On the upside, resistance is placed at Rs 1,376.\n\nJay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services\n\nNMDC broke out above a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on December 23 from Rs 78.6, rallying to Rs 86.72 before correcting. The pullback found strong support at the 100-day EMA and successfully retested the breakout zone. On January 28, the stock delivered a decisive breakout above a long-term wedge pattern, forming a powerful three white soldiers candle with rising positive volume, confirming accumulation.\n\nThe price now trades above all key EMAs with upward slopes. Over the past two sessions, it has retested the wedge breakout zone. Momentum remains bullish, and the structure favours buyers as long as the 100-day EMA holds.\n\nGiven the post-Budget sell-off in indices, add positions in a staggered manner and increase exposure only once the price sustains above the Budget day’s high.\n\nPower Finance Corporation| CMP: Rs 381.5\n\nPFC has broken out above a long-term bullish wedge and sloping channel, supported by strong volumes, indicating solid participation. The stock trades above all key EMAs except the 200-day EMA. In the latest session, following positive Budget 2026 commentary on PFC/REC restructuring, it attempted to break the 200-day EMA but faced some profit booking.\n\nOverall, the bias remains bullish, with higher lows forming and a positive crossover between the 20- and 50-day EMAs. Given the post-Budget sell-off in indices, add positions in a staggered manner and increase exposure only once the price sustains above the Budget day’s high.\n\nJindal Steel broke out above its all-time high after consolidating from May 2024 to January 2026, clearing the tough Rs 1,080–1,100 resistance zone (marked multiple times earlier) on strong and rising volumes, indicating genuine participation. The latest session successfully retested the breakout zone without violation.\n\nThe stock trades well above all key EMAs with upward slopes, confirming a strong structure. Momentum indicators support a continued bullish bias. Given the post-Budget sell-off in indices, add positions in a staggered manner and increase exposure only once the price sustains above the Budget day’s high.\n\nAnand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Investments\n\nArvind is attempting to form a base near Rs 330 after a strong rebound, creating higher lows within a multi-month range of Rs 305–347. A decisive close above Rs 347 would confirm a range breakout and open up targets of Rs 360–375, while failure near this zone would keep the stock rotational. On the downside, Rs 318–312 remains the immediate support area, followed by a stronger base near Rs 305–297.\n\nMomentum is improving, with the RSI rising above 50 into the 60s and the MACD turning up with a contracting negative histogram, indicating early momentum repair and a developing base.\n\nThe technical setup is supported by favourable policy tailwinds from the Union Budget 2026, which announced a five-part, sector-wide push for textiles, covering the National Fibre Scheme, Textile Expansion & Employment Scheme, National Handloom & Handicraft Programme, Text ECON initiative, and SAMARTH 2.0 for skill development. These measures aim to modernise textile clusters, strengthen supply chains, and upgrade workforce capabilities, providing structural medium-term support for integrated textile players like Arvind and reinforcing the stock’s constructive bias on confirmed breakouts.\n\nRaymond is showing early signs of a short-term turnaround after a sharp corrective phase. On the weekly chart, the stock has formed an inverted hammer, a classic bullish reversal signal when it appears after a decline, indicating rejection of lower levels and emerging buying interest. This pattern suggests that downside momentum may be losing steam, even as the broader trend remains corrective.\n\nMomentum indicators support this view. The MACD histogram is showing clear exhaustion, with negative bars contracting, pointing to waning selling pressure and the possibility of a short-term bounce. While the MACD line remains below the signal line, the improving histogram hints at early stabilisation. The RSI remains subdued but is attempting to base, consistent with a relief rally setup rather than a full trend reversal.",

        "full_content": "The government’s budget for 2026-27 is a positive for the economy, with three key takeaways, two of which are positive for the health of the Indian economy in the medium to long term. First is the increase in STT on F&O transactions in the country is likely to divert capital from futile and unproductive trading to actual economic activities like consumption and second is the setting up of a high level committee to review banking and financial sector in the country which could pave the way for privatization of PSBs and by extension attracting foreign capital in the country.\n\nA key negative was the rise in capex in the context of slowing tax revenues in the country, at the expense of increased government borrowing. This could lead to rise in cost of funds in India via a tightening bond market.\n\nWhilst the capital markets may have reacted negatively in the wake of the budget that was tabled on 1st February 2026, we believe most measures in the budget are largely steps taken in the right direction by the Government of India. There are broadly three major takeaways from this budget, two of which are with a view to bolster the Indian economy in the medium to long term.\n\nThe increase in Securities Transaction Tax or STT increase on Futures and Option (F&O) trading which is likely to shift money away from futile trading activity to economic activity and consumption.\n\nHigh level committee which is to be set up to review the banking and financial system in the country which is likely to expedite privatization of public sector banks (PSBs), potentially attracting foreign capital; and\n\nRise in capex of Rs 1 lakh crore from FY26 budgetary estimate which has led to rise in gross borrowings of the government and which could raise the cost of borrowing for the economy.\n\nLet’s understand each of these in detail.\n\nIncrease in STT for F&O transactions\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has been highlighting for some time now that retail investors in India have been incurring a loss of Rs 1 lakh crore per annum in the F&O market in the country, often benefiting foreign institutional investors who generally tend to have sophisticated software and trading strategies in place. This means that over the last 3 years, gullible retail investors have lost around Rs 3 lakh crore (or $33 bn) in F&O trading, a pretty large sum of money for a country whose per capita income is just over Rs 2 lakh per annum ($2,500).\n\nIn this backdrop, the raising of STT on Futures from 0.02% to 0.05% and on option premia from 0.1% to 0.15% is step in the right direction. This is so because this creates a strong disincentive for retail investors to keep speculating in the F&O market. This change could divert money from futile and non-productive trading to growth inducing activities like consumption and saving (which then leads to investment).\n\nHigh level committee for reviewing banking and financial sector\n\nThe FM in her budget speech mentioned that a high level committee will be set up to review banking and financial sector in the country. This is an interesting development, as prima facie this indicates that the government is probably thinking of privatizing PSBs and/or bringing more foreign capital and more corporate capital into the banking sector.\n\nIncrease in capex with tax revenue undershooting has led to increase in borrowings\n\nThe government, in its revised estimates for FY26 has shown that it’s gross and net tax revenues are falling short by a substantial 4.5% and 5.7% respectively. In this context, the Government's decision to increase capex by around Rs.1 lakh crore from the budget estimate of Rs 11.21 lakh crore in FY26 to Rs 12.2 lakh crore in FY27 is something we believe that could’ve been avoided.\n\nThis jump in capex has come at the expense of gross borrowings shooting up to more than Rs 17 lakh crore in FY27 from under Rs 15 lakh crore in FY26. This heavy borrowing by government of India could increase cost of funds in the country further at a time when bond yields have only gone up, despite 125 bps of rate cuts the RBI over the past 12 months.",

        "full_content": "The Union Budget announced on February 1 was largely in line with analysts’ expectations, with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman maintaining fiscal discipline by lowering the fiscal deficit to 4.3 percent of GDP for FY27 (from 4.4 percent in FY26), based on nominal GDP growth of 10 percent and tax revenue growth of 8 percent. Further, as expected, the government increased capital expenditure by 9 percent to Rs 12.2 lakh crore, providing a boost to infrastructure and defence, while also focusing on employment generation and allocating funds to emerging segments such as data centres, artificial intelligence, tourism, and MSMEs.\n\nThe market did not anticipate any incremental growth stimulus, as the government had already announced several policy measures in the recent past, including GST rationalisation and relief in personal income tax. Additionally, the RBI had reduced the repo rate by 125 basis points in 2025, along with a 100 basis-point cut in the CRR, which had already supported growth.\n\nHowever, the key disappointment that spooked markets was the increase in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on futures and options. Experts believe this will not only impact domestic brokerages but also foreign institutional investors (FIIs), who use the F&O segment extensively as a hedging mechanism. Furthermore, the absence of any direct measures to address capital flows or currency stability also weighed on investor sentiment. The benchmark indices corrected 2 percent on Sunday.\n\n\"Overall, the budget is a mixed bag for capital markets, with a stable tax regime being maintained, although increases in certain STTs and the borrowing programme may cause some disappointment,\" Ashish Gupta, CIO at Axis Mutual Fund said.\n\nIn the backdrop of persistent global uncertainty, Harish Krishnan, CIO – Equity at Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC believes the budget reflects realism on policy and fiscal prudence. \"The government remains steadfast on its commitment to consolidation; there is a notable shift from supply-side capex-led stimulus towards supporting domestic consumption. However, elevated borrowing levels may case market discomfort in the near term but expectations in the budget seem to be conservative and leave room for upside,\" he said, adding the outlook for equities over the medium term does not alter too much.\n\nExperts have identified 9 stocks that could be considered for investment post the Union Budget:\n\nSiddhartha Khemka, Head of Research, Wealth Management at Motilal Oswal Financial Services\n\nApollo Hospitals Enterprises| Target: Rs 9,015\n\nApollo Hospitals (APHS) stands to benefit from Budget 2026 initiatives, including regional medical tourism hubs, caregiver training, accredited clinics, and the Rs 10,000 crore Biopharma Shakti mission, which support international patient inflows, hospital expansion, and clinical research. APHS is gearing up for the next growth phase via a sustained shift toward higher-acuity cases and a disciplined expansion plan, with 3,660 beds to be added over five years.\n\nHealthCo execution remains on track, with Apollo 24/7 nearing EBITDA breakeven by Q4FY26, while AHLL’s diagnostics-led strategy drives sustained growth. We remain positive, forecasting a 14%/17%/24% revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR over FY25–28.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra| Target: Rs 4,521\n\nMahindra & Mahindra (M&M) is well positioned to benefit from the Rs 1 lakh crore infrastructure capex, incentives for advanced construction equipment, and the revival of 200 industrial clusters, alongside continued emphasis on farm mechanisation and rural productivity. These initiatives support sustained demand across tractors, construction equipment, and mobility solutions.\n\nM&M targets strong long-term growth, with an 8x expansion in SUVs and LCVs and 3x growth in the Farm segment over FY20–30 (~12% revenue CAGR), aided by new launches, platform rollouts, and volume gains. Growth businesses continue to scale rapidly, while disciplined capital allocation underpins returns.\n\nBiocon is well positioned to capitalize on the Rs 10,000 crore Biopharma Shakti mission, which emphasizes biologics, biosimilars, and non-communicable diseases, aligning with its diabetes and oncology portfolio and boosting domestic biologics manufacturing. The acquisition of Viatris’ biosimilar business strengthens Biocon’s global integrated biologics leadership, complementing its product development and manufacturing capabilities.\n\nWith ongoing scale-up across biologics, generics, and CDMO, coupled with new product launches like insulin aspart and operating leverage in Syngene, Biocon is set for a strong earnings revival over FY26–28.\n\nLarsen & Tubro| Target: Rs 4,500\n\nLarsen & Toubro (L&T) stands to benefit from Budget support for advanced infrastructure equipment, development of three dedicated chemical parks, and revival of 200 industrial clusters, expanding EPC opportunities across infrastructure, hydrocarbons, and defence. Order inflows remain strong, particularly from the Middle East, where 10–15% annual growth is expected over five years.\n\nGrowth is underpinned by thermal BTG projects, select domestic private capex, and emerging opportunities in data centers, electrolysers, and semiconductor design. Disciplined capital allocation, non-core divestments, and international diversification enhance execution visibility. We expect core EPC revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 16%/19%/22% over FY25–28.\n\nShrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research at Kotak Securities\n\nIndian Hotel company (IHCL) is the largest play on India’s hospitality sector, supported by its extensive presence across mid-to-premium segments and strong positioning in both business and leisure destinations. IHCL is well positioned to benefit from the favourable demand-supply dynamics driving India’s hotel sector.\n\nTata Consultancy Services| CMP: Rs 3,675\n\nTCS is well-positioned to be a core partner to clients across cloud, data & AI journeys. TCS is taking measures to close the gap with peers, including better focus on mega deals, reduced sales slippage & a renewed AI and M&A strategy. Initial results are encouraging.\n\nDevarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities\n\nSai Life Sciences| Target: Rs 1,160\n\nIn the budget, the government has proposed the Biopharma SHAKTI. The strategy will include a Biopharma-focused network with 3 new National Institutes of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER) and upgrading 7 existing ones. It will also create a network of over 1000 accredited India Clinical Trials sites.\n\nIndian Contract Research, Development, and Manufacturing Organizations (CRDMO) market is poised to grow rapidly at a CAGR of 13-15% over 2024-2029E.\n\nSai Life Sciences (SLS) is an integrated CRDMO, capitalizing on niche capabilities and capacity expansion.\n\nWe remain optimistic about key factors such as: integrated business model across discovery, development, and manufacturing helps it emerge as a one-stop solution. Tapping the obesity and metabolic API (GLP) market across peptides, and small molecules (lab and commercial scale). Third, a differentiated global integrated delivery, R&D, and discovery model in key innovation hubs (US: Boston and UK: Manchester), with large-scale, cost-efficient manufacturing supported by R&D infrastructure in India.\n\nWe estimate 20% CAGR in revenue, while EBITDA and PAT to grow at faster pace at 28%/39% CAGR over FY25-28E.\n\nSyrma SGS Technology| Target: Rs 920\n\nThe Indian government proposed increasing the Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme outlay to Rs 40,000 crore for FY26-27, a significant jump from FY25-26. Syrma SGS is set to benefit, reporting a Rs 6,400 crore order book as of December 2025. The company projects over 30% YoY growth in revenue and EBITDA for FY27. Investors can buy the stock with a target price of Rs 920.\n\nZensar Technologies| Target: Rs 830\n\nThe Union Budget 2026-27 marks a decisive shift from \"digital-first\" to \"intelligence-first,\" with a heavy emphasis on AI, semiconductors, and simplifying the tax landscape for IT giants and Global Capability Centres (GCCs). This landscape favours Zensar, which is leveraging AI-driven solutions and cross-sector diversification. Its focus on operational efficiency and strategic growth aligns perfectly with the nation’s evolving digital and industrial goals. Investors can buy the stock with a target price of Rs 830.",

        "full_content": "Fiscal consolidation roadmap in placeReceipt budget factors in meaningful increase in disinvestmentSTT forms a minuscule part of receipt and a tax tweak had negligible fiscal impactQuality of expenditure continues to improve\n\nFinance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has clearly walked the path of fiscal consolidation in the Union Budget and succeeded to keep the fiscal deficit to GDP for FY26 at 4.4 percent and pegged the fiscal deficit to GDP for FY27 at 4.3 percent although the new goal post appears to be the debt to GDP ratio. The debt to GDP glide path has been spelt out with the government targeting to bring it down to 50% +/- 1% by FY31 from 56.1% in FY26 and 55.6 percent in FY27. The government is in no mood to splurge on unproductive expenditure and the budget continues to put thrust on capex. Despite the apparent “no negative” in the budget, the equity markets nosedived, thanks to the increase in STT (securities transaction tax) on futures and options. The moot question therefore was it necessary to hike the STT to keep the finances in order?\n\nLet us deep dive into the fiscal math\n\nThe fiscal deficit for FY27 is pegged at Rs 16.9 lakh crore which translates into fiscal deficit to GDP of 4.3 percent on a nominal GDP of Rs 393 lakh crore for FY27. This implies a nominal GDP growth of 10 percent, looking plausible given the consensus expectations of 7 percent real GDP growth in FY27.\n\nThe YoY increase in fiscal deficit is close to 8.8 percent which is much higher than the nearly flat performance in FY26 over FY25.\n\nOn the revenue front, overall receipt showed a slightly lower growth than last year, thanks to stagnant non-tax revenue. Turning to tax revenue, the overall gross tax revenue to GDP for FY27 at 11.2 percent of GDP is similar to what was seen in previous years. The projected YoY growth in corporate tax at 11 percent in FY27 is similar to the 12 percent achieved in the previous fiscal. It is the income tax head that warrants a hard look.\n\nIncome tax collection in FY26 RE (revised estimate) of Rs 13.1 lakh crore was way off the initial budget estimates of Rs 14.4 lakh crore. Thanks to this miss, the projected collection for FY27 at Rs 14.7 lakh crore shows a rather ambitious growth of 12 percent. However, it is barely a 2 percent increase over the initial income tax collection estimates of FY26. What’s more interesting is the STT (securities transaction tax figure) within income tax – at Rs 73,700 crore is only 5 percent of total collection and is expected to increase by Rs 10,030 crore in FY27 thanks to the tax tweaks with the increase in STT on Futures and options. The incremental gains from STT is barely 27 basis points of the government’s total receipts in FY27 and have negligible impact on the overall numbers.\n\nOne of the growth drivers on the revenue front in FY27 will be the sharp expected increase in the disinvestment target. While the government missed the target in FY26, the target for FY27 at Rs 80,000 crore looks a tad bit of a tall order given the FY26 achievement of Rs 33,837 crore and would require a supportive market environment.\n\nWhy the market ignored the budget?\n\nHowever, what turned out to be a serious spoiler that masked the steady improvement in the quality of expenditure is the STT hike. The break-up of the expenditure shows an improvement in the share of capital expenditure in total expenditure in FY27 over the previous fiscal.\n\nDefence expenditure, while not showing a runaway increase in FY27 over FY26RE, as the Revised Estimates of FY26 had a meaningful increase due to Operation Sindoor, showed a good momentum in defence capex.\n\nOverall capital expenditure, including railways and extra budgetary resources, has also seen a YoY increase of 18 percent in FY27 and at 6.3 percent of GDP marks a 40 basis points improvement over the previous fiscal.\n\nIn sum, the fiscal math is based on realistic assumptions and should have been welcomed by the market, had it not been for the spoiler in STT which has no meaningful impact on the fiscal numbers. To discipline excessive speculation by retail investors, the finance minister could have chosen a non-fiscal path or could have soothed the pain perhaps with an investor-friendly tweak to the capital gains tax that could have improved sentiment without breaking the fisc.",

        "full_content": "Equity markets reacted sharply to Union Budget 2026, with the Nifty slipping 2 percent. The absence of any announcement on long-term capital gains taxation proved particularly disappointing for markets that had priced in at least a signalling move. Instead of sentiment support, the government raised STT on F&O trading, further denting market mood. That said, the sell-off reflected unmet expectations rather than any deterioration in fundamentals.\n\nThe headline numbers were reassuring — on fiscal deficit, absolute capex growth, and year-on-year expansion. However, the Budget lacked broad-based incentives for boosting demand/consumption, offering only incremental support to select sectors.\n\nUnion Budget 2026-27 largely focused on cost reduction for strategic manufacturing, clean energy, defence, healthcare, exports, with targeted announcements for data centres, EMS, and semiconductors ecosystem.  While the broad market reaction was negative, some sectors and stocks stand to benefit while some may the feel the pain of budgetary announcement.\n\nKey beneficiaries of investment push with focus on defence\n\nIn Budget 2026-27, the government increased capital expenditure to Rs 12.21 lakh crore, marking a 12 percent rise over the revised estimates for FY2025-26. The boost in capex is expected to enhance order flows and earnings visibility, benefiting construction and infrastructure players such asL&T, Afcons, NCC, PNC Infratech, HG Infra, and KNR Constructions.\n\nAmong key sectors, railways, roadways, and defence saw significant allocations, rising 10 percent, 8 percent, and 18 percent respectively. Notably, the Union Budget FY2026-27 marks a strategic inflection point for India’s defence ecosystem, with a sharp push towards higher capital spending, indigenisation, and private-sector participation. The total defence outlay has been raised to Rs 7.85 lakh crore, up 15.2 percent YoY, providing long-term visibility for multi-year procurement programmes and supporting a broad range of defence suppliers and manufacturers.\n\nCrucially, capital expenditure has jumped 20.1 percent YoY to Rs2.31 lakh crore (FY27BE), materially improving visibility for modernisation and new platform acquisitions. This is positive across the defence value chain — from PSUs such asBEL, Bharat Dynamics, HAL, and Mazagon Dockto key private suppliers likeMTAR, Data Patterns and Solar Industries, which are well placed for order-book expansion.\n\nA key structural positive is the launch of a Rs 5,000-crore Deep-Tech Fund for private-sector R&D, a potential game-changer for niche, high-tech players such asZen Technologies and Astra Microwavefocused on simulations, electronics and advanced systems.\n\nOn the cost side, full Basic Customs Duty (BCD) exemption on raw materials for aircraft parts and MRO units lowers entry barriers and lifecycle costs. This benefits HAL in maintaining the Tejas and Sukhoi fleets, while exemptions for civilian training aircraft parts support a broader aviation-defence ecosystem.\n\nKey beneficiaries of the push for strategic sectors like rare-earth minerals, data centres, EMS, and semiconductor ecosystem\n\nThe budget’s emphasis on rare-earth corridors and critical mineral security provides a strategic backstop, with companies likeMIDHANIpoised to benefit from domestic sourcing of specialised alloys and materials.\n\nThe Union Budget 2026 proposes a tax holiday for foreign companies offering cloud services to global customers using data centre infrastructure in India, while mandating that Indian customers be served via a local reseller. This signals the government’s intent to attract foreign investment into domestic digital infrastructure without compromising data sovereignty.\n\nWhile the incentive is aimed at global players,E2E Networks—India’s only listed, homegrown GPU cloud platform—stands to benefit indirectly.\n\nBudget 2026 gives a strong thrust to India’s electronics and semiconductor ecosystem, signalling a shift from assembly-led growth to full-stack capability building. The rollout of India Semiconductor Mission 2.0 and the near-doubling of the Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme to Rs 40,000 crore highlight the push to localise equipment, materials, components, and semiconductor IP.\n\nWith mobile manufacturing already scaling ~30x to Rs 5.45 lakh crore in FY25, the budget significantly improves long-term earnings and margin visibility across the EMS and semiconductor value chain. Listed beneficiaries includeKaynes Technology, Amber Enterprises, Syrma SGS Technology, and Dixon Technologies.\n\nStructural push for India’s Textile Sector, Healthcare, Tourism, and Aquaculture\n\nUnion Budget 2026 lays out a cohesive policy framework for textiles, apparel and leather, centred on Mega Textile Parks and an integrated, end-to-end textile programme. The focus on fibre-to-finished-goods integration is aimed at closing India’s competitiveness gap with Vietnam and Bangladesh, while strengthening its China+1 positioning.\n\nWell-capitalised, export-oriented players with scale and compliance readiness stand to benefit the most.Companies such as Gokaldas Exports, KPR Mill, Pearl Global, Welspun Living, Trident, Vardhman Textiles, SP Apparel, and Raymondshould gain from operating leverage, shared infrastructure, and diversified export markets. Technical textiles and MMF-focused players also see incremental upside.\n\nIn contrast, smaller unorganised manufacturers and cotton-heavy, domestically focused players may see slower gains, as benefits are likely to accrue gradually and remain execution-led at the state and cluster level.\n\nUnion Budget 2026 proposes setting up five integrated medical hubs combining treatment, wellness (including AYUSH), diagnostics and patient facilitation, in partnership with the private sector, to boost medical tourism.\n\nLeading hospital chains such asMax Healthcare, Apollo Hospitals, Narayana Health, and Fortis Healthcare, along with large diagnostics players likeDr. Lal PathLabs, Metropolis Healthcare, and Vijaya Diagnostics, are key beneficiaries. Medical tourism, which already contributes ~6-9 percent of revenues for major hospital groups such asMedanta and Max, deliver higher revenue per patient. The policy push should lift international patient inflows, supporting earnings growth and cash flows for hospital chains.\n\nAlongside medical tourism, the Union Budget outlined plans to develop new tourism avenues—heritage and cultural circuits and a push for hosting more global events. The development of new destinations and increased global summits should drive higher travel inflows and hotel demand.\n\nThis is positive for hotel companies such as Indian Hotels,EIH, ITC Hotels, Lemon Tree, Royal Orchid, Juniper, and SAMHI Hotels. Tourism-linked plays, includingIxigo, VIP Industries, and Safari Industries, are also likely to benefit from the uptrend in travel and leisure demand.\n\nUnion Budget 2026 rolled out targeted growth measures for aquaculture, including raising the duty-free import limit for key inputs from 1 percent to 3 percent of prior-year export turnover, developing 500 reservoirs and Amrit Sarovars, and promoting self-employment across the fisheries and animal husbandry value chain.\n\nWhile the domestic shrimp industry faces near-term stress after the US imposed a steep 50 percent tariff, the Budget—along with the India-EU FTA signed in January 2026—offers a crucial backstop. The focus on cost competitiveness, productivity and access to European markets positions the sector for resilience. Industry leaders such asAvanti Feeds and Apex Frozen Foodsstand to benefit from these measures despite US tariff related headwinds.\n\nKey beneficiaries from positioning India as manufacturing hub for chemicals and bio-similars\n\nThe Union Budget 2026 announced two targeted schemes to cut import dependence and build domestic scale in chemicals and biopharma.\n\nFirst, the government will support states to set up three dedicated chemical parks via a challenge-based, plug-and-play cluster model, with an outlay of Rs 600 crore in FY27. This aims to reduce over-concentration in hubs like Dahej (Gujarat) and seed new manufacturing clusters. While details on locations and sub-segments are awaited, players such asSRF, Navin Fluorine, Atul, Aarti Industries, and Balaji Aminescould benefit over time.\n\nSecond, the Budget unveiled the Biopharma SHAKTI scheme with a Rs 10,000 crore outlay over five years (Rs 500 crore in FY27). The programme includes three new NIPERs, upgrades to seven existing institutes, and a network of 1,000+ accredited clinical trial sites to position India as a global biopharma manufacturing hub. The timing is favourable amid the US Biosecure Act and rising global outsourcing.\n\nLarge generic pharma companies with biosimilar pipelines —Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy’s, Cipla, Zydus— stand to gain, alongside CDMO players such asDivi’s Labs, Sai Life, OneSource Specialty and Syngene,especially with growing opportunities around post-patent GLP-1 drugs and clinical trials.\n\nTax clarity for IT companies, shock for capital market players and cigarette companies\n\nThe Budget brings welcome clarity on buybacks, especially positive for cash-rich IT companies that regularly return surplus capital. All buybacks will now be taxed as capital gains, replacing the dividend-like treatment introduced in 2024.\n\nA bigger positive is the overhaul of safe harbour rules. The Budget clubs multiple services under a single “IT services” category with a uniform safe harbour margin of 15.5 percent, raises the threshold sharply from Rs 300 crore to Rs 2,000 crore, allows automated approvals, and extends the option for five years.\n\nThese measures significantly reduce transfer-pricing risk and compliance burden, making the changes broadly positive for the IT sector, benefiting players such asTCS, Infosys and Wipro.\n\nUnion Budget 2026 delivers a major tax shock to the tobacco sector. The NCCD (National Calamity Contingent Duty) on chewing tobacco, jarda, and allied products has been sharply hiked to 60 percent from 25 percent (effective May 2026). This move come after GST being raised to 40 percent from 28 percent, starting February 1, 2026. In addition, the excise framework has been overhauled—replacing the earlier per-stick BED (basic excise duty) with a steep retail sales price linked levy, pushing overall tax incidence up by an estimated 40-50 percent.\n\nThis sudden and adverse reset triggered a sharp sell-off in cigarette stocks, withITCdown around 15 percent andGodfrey Phillipsover 12 percent in the past month. To offset the higher tax burden, companies may need price hikes of 25-40 percent, which risks denting volumes, compressing margins, and hurting near-term profitability. Higher prices also raise the threat of illicit trade, weakening industry competitiveness.\n\nThe most damaging Budget surprise was the sharp hike in STT on F&O trades. STT on futures has been raised to 0.05 percent from 0.02 percent, while options premium and exercise now attract 0.15 percent each, up from 0.10 percent and 0.125 percent, respectively.\n\nHigher STT makes derivatives less attractive for retail traders, directly hitting turnover and profitability. Exchanges are clear losers—BSE, which has rapidly gained F&O market share since April 2023, faces potential volume-led earnings hit, whileNSEalso sees near-term negatives as it gears up for an IPO (even though its cash equities business remains unaffected).\n\nThe impact will be sharper for brokers, especially discount brokers reliant on retail derivatives. After sustained regulatory tightening over the past 18 months, the Budget adds another policy overhang. Listed names such as Angel One and recently listedBillionbrains Garage Ventures(Groww) are likely to be among the worst hit.\n\nAbove all, the STT hike dealt the biggest blow to market sentiment, wiping out nearly Rs 11 lakh crore in listed market capitalisation.\n\nFor more research articles, visit ourMoneycontrol Research page",

        "full_content": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has kept both the old and new tax regimes largely unchanged in the Union Budget 2026. In such a scenario, consultants will continue to navigate familiar tax rules for the financial year 2026-27.\n\nThe Income Tax Act, 1961, allows consultants to opt for presumptive taxation under Section 44ADA with a net taxable income of up to Rs 75 lakh, wherein 50 percent of the income can be treated as expenses and pay tax on the remaining 50 percent.\n\nWhile consultants can opt for presumptive taxation under both tax regimes, here’s a look at how the scheme works, its key benefits, dos and don’ts, and the tax rules that apply.\n\nPresumptive taxation: Old vs. new tax regime\n\nThe presumptive taxation rule has been balanced in such a way that while key taxation benefits do not apply under the new tax regime, consultants opting for the old regime face higher tax slab rates.\n\nBesides the 50 percent deduction on the overall income, old regime consultants can further lower their taxable income under various sections of the Income Tax Act.\n\nSection 80C, for example, allows professionals to claim deductions of up to Rs 1.5 lakh a year through investments in PPF, EPF, ELSS mutual funds, LIC premiums, homeloans,and similar instruments.\n\nSimilarly, Section 80CCD(1B) gives an additional deduction for investments in the National Pension System (NPS), encouraging retirement savings. Section 80D offers deductions on health insurance premiums paid for self, family, and parents.\n\nSection 80TTA allows a deduction on interest earned from savings accounts. An additional deduction up to Rs 25,000 shall be available for health insurance premiums under section 80D of the IT Act.\n\nHere’s the tax comparison showing how the new taxation will change the tax structure of a consultant under the new and old tax regimes.\n\nIndividual consultant vs. consulting firms\n\nTax analysts reason that for most people, staying an individual consultant remains the most tax-efficient option until income becomes very high.\n\n“With Section 44ADA, tax is applied on half of their receipts, though there is minimal compliance, and withdrawing money for personal use has no tax implications. Even under regular taxation, tax is paid only on actual profit, and funds can be withdrawn without any additional tax,” said Ritika Nayyar, Partner, Singhania & Co.\n\nFor a consultant operating as a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) firm, the profits they earn are taxed at a flat 30 per cent and do not qualify for the benefit of Section 44ADA. Compliance increases and withdrawing money also have rules and limits.\n\nOn the other hand, a Private Limited Company becomes efficient only when profits are large, and the money is kept inside the business. “Certain sections offer lower rates of corporate tax, but withdrawals can be made only in the form of dividends, which have an additional tax liability,” said Nayyar.\n\nTips for consultants to plan and pay quarterly advance taxes\n\nAccording to SR Patnaik, Partner (head-taxation), Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, consultants must keep invoices, bills, tickets, screenshots, and proof of payment for everything to support such a claim.\n\nProfession-related expenses that can be used to claim deductions\n\nTip for using part of home as office for presumptive taxation\n\nTax analysts suggest that consultants should properly plan the portion of the house that is proposed to be used as an office and allocate relevant expenses— phone, electricity bills, other miscellaneous expenses and utilities —being used for official purposes. If the actual expenses incurred for the office are available, then the same may be claimed as a deduction.",

        "full_content": "The Union Budget 2026-27 despite focusing on long term growth with a push towards manufacturing and infrastructure has fallen short of attracting private sector investments, experts and economists say.\n\nNiranjan Hiranandani, co-founder and managing director of Hiranandani Group said that the budget is really strong on long term investments in infrastructure, data centres, chips, defence, manufacturing but does not serve any short term benefits.\n\n“So I think many of the industries will have to wait, invest, grow, and get the benefit of it. The overall growth story and the deficit, the GDP growth is very, very positive, and the long term growth in terms of the country, including real estate, looks very possible,” Hiranandani told Moneycontrol.\n\nGaurav Choudhury, Consulting Editor, Network18 noted that the big idea in the budget is that the government is not going to come under any pressure for incrementalism. “Urbanisation is going to be one of the strongest edifices of India's growth story particularly in newer, currently smaller towns, \" he added.\n\nThe government in its Budget Estimates for 2026-27 has pegged the fiscal deficit at 4.3 percent of GDP. In the Revised Estimates 2025-26, the fiscal deficit has been estimated at par with BE of 2025-26 at 4.4 percent of GDP.\n\n“I think there is a palliative in the form  of small savings figures which we think are going to beat the revised estimate for FY26 and therefore there should be more cash that the government will carry into FY27 that we have to actually bring down the borrowing numbers,” Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist at Icra.\n\nEconomists say that the budget clearly resisted any temptation to push growth higher this fiscal, or even fight the global situation.\n\n“It's clearly guided by long-term growth objectives and motives. And I think the finance commission report that has come alongside and has been taken into consideration, ensures that the states now have a bigger role to play with a lot more now going from the centre to the states,” said Dipti Deshpande, Principal Economist, Crisil.\n\nThe budget has put a lot of focus on manufacturing and infrastructure, which experts believe, will remain key for growth and job creation.\n\nThe budget is providing continuity on movement in that direction with the announcement of Rs 10,000 crore SME growth fund, especially designed to turn small businesses into future champions, Rishi Agrawal, Co-Founder and CEO at TeamLease RegTech said.\n\nExperts were however hoping the budget would boost private sector investments. “I was hoping the budget would do something substantial to build up the private sector investments. The private sector investment has been weak,” said Rajiv Kumar, chairmanship of Pahle India Foundation, former Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog.",

        "full_content": "Karnataka is set to emerge as the biggest beneficiary of the Sixteenth Finance Commission’s (16FC) horizontal devolution formula, while Madhya Pradesh is poised to take the largest hit, as the panel sharpens its focus on economic efficiency alongside equity.\n\nUnder the new formula, Karnataka’s share in the Centre’s tax devolution has been raised to 4.13 percent for 2026–31, up from 3.65 percent under the Fifteenth Finance Commission. In absolute terms, this translates into an additional Rs 7,387 crore, taking Karnataka’s allocation to Rs 63,050 crore, compared with Rs 55,663 crore Karnataka would have received under the previous formula.\n\nAn important driver behind the shift is the introduction of a 10 percent weight for “contribution to GDP” in the devolution formula—a criterion aimed at rewarding states with stronger economic performance. Karnataka, with its outsized contribution to national output through manufacturing, services and technology, benefits disproportionately from this change.\n\nKerala is the second-biggest gainer, with its allocation rising by Rs 6,975 crore and its share climbing to 2.38 percent from 1.93 percent. Gujarat (Rs 4,228 crore) and Haryana (Rs 4,090 crore) also see notable gains, reflecting their higher per capita incomes and stronger contribution to GDP. Maharashtra, India’s largest state economy, gains Rs 1,893 crore, with its share rising marginally to 6.44 percent.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Madhya Pradesh is the biggest loser, with its allocation falling by Rs 7,677 crore to Rs 1.12 lakh crore. Its share in the Centre’s divisible pool declines from 7.85 percent to 7.35 percent, as the state fares poorly on the newly added efficiency metric.\n\nLarge, population-heavy states also see reduced allocations. Uttar Pradesh loses Rs 4,884 crore, while West Bengal sees a cut of Rs 4,701 crore. Bihar, despite remaining the second-largest recipient in absolute terms, loses Rs 1,679 crore, underscoring how the new framework tempers the redistributive bias of earlier commissions.\n\nIn its report, the Finance Commission explicitly defended the shift towards efficiency. It noted that while per capita GSDP distance continues to act as a proxy for equity-related objectives such as poverty and SDG outcomes, contribution to GDP serves as a surrogate for efficiency, reflecting economic management, fiscal discipline and tax effort.\n\nThe Commission also observed that tax effort as a standalone criterion shows limited variation across states, with a correlation of 0.98 between tax-effort weighted population shares and population shares, making it ineffective in materially changing outcomes. The GDP contribution metric, by contrast, introduces meaningful differentiation.\n\nOverall, the 16th Finance Commission formula—with 42.5 percent weight for per capita GSDP distance, 17.5 percent for population, and 10 percent for contribution to GDP—marks a decisive shift. While redistribution remains the dominant objective, states that grow faster and contribute more to national output are now being rewarded more explicitly, reshaping the federal fiscal landscape for the next five years.",

        "full_content": "Presenting the Union Budget 2026 today, the government sought to address the competing priorities of economic growth, fiscal prudence, and taxpayer confidence. Against a backdrop of global uncertainty and domestic consolidation, the government has focused on incremental reforms aiming to strengthen compliance, improve transparency, and sustain long-term economic momentum. Budget 2026 prioritized TCS rationalization, foreign asset reporting transparency, and equity market liberalization keeping the personal income tax slabs unchanged.\n\nThe key announcements impacting individual taxpayers include the following:\n\n1. Extended timelines for filing original and revised tax returns\n\nTaxpayers will now be able to file revised returns up to 31 March, instead of the earlier deadline of 31 December, subject to payment of a nominal fee.\n\nIt also comes as a relief for individual taxpayers with cross-border income or investments, as tax filings in their home or host countries are usually not finalized by 31 December. Proposed extension would give them time to align their foreign income reported in the overseas tax returns with the income being reported in their India tax return.\n\nIn addition, the due date for filing original returns by taxpayers with non-audit business income and trusts is proposed to be extended from 31 July to 31 August. However, timelines for individuals filing ITR-1 and ITR-2 remain unchanged, ensuring consistency for taxpayers with relatively simple income profiles.\n\n2. Rationalization of Tax Collected at Source (TCS) Rates\n\nSignificant boost from a cash flow perspective have been provided by rationalizing TCS on certain remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS). The TCS rate on overseas tour program packages, as well as remittances for education and medical purposes, is proposed to be reduced to 2% from the existing 5% or 20%, offering meaningful relief to families.\n\n3. Exemption to global income of “global talent” staying in India for a longer period\n\nWith an objective to attract global specialized talent working in India under government-notified schemes, the Budget introduces a new exemption for such individuals who were non-resident for 5 years preceding their first visit to India. Such individuals will be eligible for a five-year tax exemption on their foreign income.\n\n4. Foreign Assets of Small Taxpayers Disclosure Scheme, 2026\n\nAcknowledging that non-reporting of foreign assets is often inadvertent, arising from factors such as ESOPs or RSUs, dormant overseas bank accounts, legacy insurance policies, or savings accumulated during periods of non-residency, the government has introduced a Foreign Assets Disclosure Scheme for Small Taxpayers with a six-month compliance window.\n\nThe measure builds on the success of the recent NUDGE campaign, which resulted in nearly 25,000 revised returns and disclosures of approximately INR 29,000 crore in foreign assets and INR 1,000 crore in foreign income. By offering a structured opportunity for voluntary correction, the scheme seeks to encourage transparency while clearly distinguishing genuine reporting lapses from deliberate non-compliance.\n\nUnder the scheme, undisclosed foreign assets and income of up to INR 1 crore may be regularised on payment of tax at 30 per cent along with the prescribed levy. In cases where assets were acquired during periods of non-residency or out of income already taxed in India, a flat levy of INR 1 lakh will apply, provided the aggregate value of such assets does not exceed INR 5 crore. The scheme offers a fair and time-bound pathway for small taxpayers to rectify past omissions while reducing the risk of prolonged litigation.\n\nOverall, the Union Budget 2026 signals a steady shift towards a more facilitative tax ecosystem, with an emphasis on simplifying procedures. It draws a clearer distinction between deliberate tax evasion and genuine reporting lapses, particularly in the context of global income and overseas assets. An attempt has been made to reflect a mature approach to tax administration, one that prioritises clarity, trust, and voluntary compliance.",

        "full_content": "The Union Budget 2026 may not have announced any fresh sops or changes for popular retirement schemes such as EPF, PPF and NPS, but there has been a series of reforms in recent years to streamline taxation and strengthen long-term retirement security.\n\nWe look at the popular contributory retirement savings schemes backed by the Government of India —namely, Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), and the National Pension System (NPS)— to understand their features, benefits, as well as deductions that apply for members under the new and old tax regimes.\n\nEmployees Provident Fund - EPF\n\nThe EPF is a government-backed interest-bearing retirement savings scheme for private-sector salaried employees earning over Rs 15,000 a month, where employees contribute 12 percent of basic pay (up to Rs 1,800), and employers match the contribution.\n\nThe Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has set the EPF interest rate at 8.5 percent for FY 2025–26, credited to active member accounts. EPF normally matures at age 58, enabling full withdrawal, whileunemployed members can withdrawup to 75 percent of their balance after one month without work.\n\nMembers who have completed five years of contribution to the pension fund can also opt for 50-90 percentloansof the total balance of EPF as collateral. Tax applies if an employee’s annual contribution exceeds Rs 2.5 lakh. Withdrawals are tax-free after five years, while premature withdrawals attract 10% TDS on amounts above Rs 50,000, subject to exemptions for cases such as illness or job loss.\n\nThe Public Provident Fund (PPF) is another government pension scheme for all residents of India, wherein employment is not a factor. Individuals can open an account through banks or post offices and earn 7.1% annual interest on investments ranging from Rs 500 to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year, made either as a lump sum or in instalments.\n\nA pension fund comes with amaturity period of 15 yearsto get full retirement benefits. Partial withdrawals of up to 50 percent of the balance are allowed after five years. Members can also avail loans by using the PPF balance as collateral after three years of investment.\n\nSimilar to EPF, PPF also enjoys an exempt–exempt–exempt (EEE) tax status. Contributions qualify for tax deduction under Section 80C, interest earned is tax-free, and the maturity amount or withdrawals are fully exempt from income tax.\n\nThe National Pension Scheme (NPS) is a government-backed, market-linked retirement savings programme for salaried employees and self-employed individuals, as well as NRIs. The pension fund is unique for its account types, offering Tier I as a mandatory retirement account and Tier II as a voluntary account.\n\nInvestment in NPS is allocated across equity, corporate debt, government securities, and alternative assets, based on the subscriber’s choice of active or auto investment options. Contributions are flexible, with a minimum of Rs 1,000 per year for Tier I, and returns depend on market performance.\n\nNPS matures at the age of 60. On retirement, subscribers can withdraw up to 60 percent of the accumulated corpus as a lump sum, while the remaining 40 percent must be used to purchase an annuity plan.\n\nUnlike EPF and PPF, the NPS does not offer collateral loan benefits to subscribers. Partial withdrawals of up to 25 percent of the subscriber’s own contributions are permitted after three years, while premature exit before 60 is allowed under certain conditions.\n\nNPS has become attractive for various tax benefits available to subscribers under Sections 80CCD(1), 80CCD(1B) and 80CCD(2). On maturity, members can withdraw up to 60 percent as a lump sum, and it is tax-free, while annuity income is taxed as per the applicable income tax slab.",

In the midst of all this, it's very important that we remain fiscally responsible to have brought down the fiscal deficit down to 4.3% and to have brought down the debt to GDP ratio to 65.6%,” Kant said.\n\nKant highlighted that the Budget 2026 needs to be looked at in terms of how it is handling the issue of US tariffs.\n\nKant said that since the budget focuses on sectors like textiles, footwear, leather as well as marine sector, which have implications for jobs, it will eventually give a big thrust and drive to urbanisation, which will be critical for the country’s growth story.\n\nThe Union Budget 2026 has aimed to provide a boost to the country’s infrastructure. The government has increased public capital expenditure to Rs 12.2 lakh crore in FY 2026-27.\n\nThe government will also set up an Infrastructure Risk Guarantee Fund to strengthen the confidence of private developers regarding risks during infrastructure development and construction phase.\n\nKant noted India’s long term growth has to be driven by the private sector. “In the long term, the challenge for India is really to grow at 8-9% over the next 22 years to be Viksit Bharat by 2047. That can't be done on the back of public spending,” Kant said. He added that the public spending has already reached its peak. “You need the private sector to drive India's growth story in the long run.\"\n\nCalling the Budget ‘on course for Viksit Bharat 2047’, he said that the private sector needs to invest in infrastructure and pointed out the need for higher Foreign Direct Investments (FDI).\n\n“We need to do a little more on the consumption story, and need to get Foreign Direct Investment back in a very, very big way. We need to promote and market India in a far more comprehensive manner,” Kant said.\n\nPresenting the Budget 2026, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1 said that the budget is inspired by three kartavyas which is to accelerate and sustain economic growth, to fulfil aspirations of  people and build their capacity, and to ensure that every family, community, region and sector has access to resources, amenities and opportunities for meaningful participation.",

In Budget 2025-26 the central government had allocated Rs 19,794 crore for PMAY Urban 2.0 scheme, which is focused on the government's motto of \"Housing for All\".\n\nHowever, in the revised budget estimates of 2025-26, the allocation for PMAY Urban 2.0 was reduced to Rs 7,500 crore.\n\nIn the interim Union Budget 2024-25 the government had allocated Rs 80,671 crore for the PMAY. In budget estimates for Budget 2023-24, the government had allocated Rs 79,590 crore for PMAY.\n\nAccording to experts, the PMAY has been a crucial initiative in addressing the housing shortage across both urban and rural areas. The scheme offers essential credit-linked subsidies, helping eligible families to achieve homeownership and access basic amenities significantly improving their living conditions. In the last 10 years, the scheme has facilitated the completion of more than 4.21 crore homes.\n\nBudget 2026-27 also saw around 20 percent reduction in allocation for Urban Rejuvenation Mission: AMRUT and Smart Cities Mission. The Budget 2026-27 allocated Rs 8,000 crore for Urban Rejuvenation Mission: AMRUT and Smart Cities Mission while it was Rs 10,000 crore in 2025-26 budget estimates.\n\nIn the Budget 2026-27, there was no specific announcement for the affordable housing, which left the  real estate sector players \"dissappointed\".\n\nAccording to ANAROCK data, the sales share of affordable housing has sharply declined, falling from over 38 percent in 2019 to 26 percent in 2022 and further to around 18 percent in 2025.\n\nCREDAI National President Shekhar Patel said developers welcome the continued emphasis on infrastructure spending but was “deeply disappointed” by the lack of concrete measures for affordable housing.\n\n\"CREDAI is deeply disappointed that the Budget offers nothing concrete for affordable housing. With the current outdated definition of affordable housing, CREDAI estimates that the segment’s share could decline further from 18 percent to nearly 12 percent of total housing supply. This is a serious warning sign for India’s lower middle class and middle class,\" he said.",

        "full_content": "The budget has provided clarity on buyback which is especially positive for cash rich IT companies that periodically return cash to shareholders.\n\nThe Budget proposes that all buybacks will now be taxed as capital gains, replacing the dividend‑like treatment introduced in 2024. To further disincentivise promoters from using buybacks to reduce tax liability, the budget has announced an additional buyback tax on promoters. The change will push the effective tax burden to 22 percent for corporate promoters and 30 percent for non‑corporate promoters.\n\nThe buyback overhaul builds on the rules notified from October 1, 2024, which had shifted the tax liability from companies to shareholders. Under those rules, the entire buyback amount was treated as dividend income in the hands of shareholders and taxed at slab rates.\n\nA key provision that remains is the treatment of share acquisition cost. The cost of shares tendered in a buyback will continue to be treated as a capital loss, either short term or long term, depending on the holding period. Investors can set off these losses against other capital gains or carry them forward for up to eight years, providing some relief in the new system. For small shareholders, the shift to capital gains is expected to give clearer tax outcomes and reduce disputes over classification. For promoters, the additional levy aims to correct what the government views as an uneven tax advantage created by the old rules.\n\nThe other significant announcement pertains to safe harbour.  Safe Harbour rules in India are Income Tax regulations (Section 92CB) that allow taxpayers to adopt pre-defined transfer pricing margins for international transactions, reducing litigation and compliance burdens.\n\nIf an assessee opts for safe harbour and their declared price meets the prescribed margin/circumstances, the income-tax authorities will accept it, avoiding transfer pricing audits. Covered transactions include provision of software development services, IT-enabled services, Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO),loansto wholly-owned subsidiaries, corporate guarantees, contract R&D, and low-value intra-group services. These rules provide a safe, predetermined framework, allowing companies to avoid lengthy, complex audits.\n\nThe budget has clubbed multiple services under a single category of information technology services with a common safe harbour margin of 15.5%. Safe harbour threshold for IT services has been increased from Rs 300 crore to Rs 2,000 crore. Approval of safe harbour for IT services would be an automated rule-driven process and the budget has allowed continuation of safe harbour for a period of five years at the company’s choice.\n\nThe overall IT sector would see these developments as positive and would benefit stocks like TCS, Infosys, Wipro etc.\n\nFor more research articles, visit ourMoneycontrol Research page",

From resource allocation point of view, the defence budget has arrested its declining share in both GDP and the CGE, indicating government’s resolve to bring its focus back on security and defence modernisation in particular. Noticeably, the 15% increase in defence budget is significantly higher than the 10% estimated increase in the nominal GDP and 6% increase in the overall Union Budget.\n\nSecond, the growth in the defence budget comes in backdrop of the previous budget being revised upward by 8% or Rs 51,301 crore. Significantly, both the revenue and capital segments of the MoD’s previous allocations have been revised upward—a rarity in the MoD’s budget making history.\n\nDefence capex growth outpace revenue expenditure rise\n\nThird, in percentage terms, the expansion in overall capital expenditure of the MoD’s latest budget has outgrown that in revenue expenditure, signifying a greater focus on modernisation (while the capital expenditure has increased by 20% to Rs 2.31 lakh crore, the revenue budget has grown by 13% to Rs 5.53 lakh crore).\n\nCutting edge of the military establishment get the biggest budgetary boost\n\nOf the MoD’s total allocations, 75% is earmarked for the defence services, which includes the army, navy, air force and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO); the balance is distributed between defence pensions (22%) and MoD Civil expenditure (4%) that caters to the organisations such as Border Roads Organization and Coast Guard, among others. Among these three broad components, the budget of the defence services has growth the most—19% in comparison to 7% hike in pensions; MoD’s Civil expenditure has remained nearly stagnant.\n\nConsidering that the defence services are at the heart of India’s defence posture and military capability, the 19% increase in their budget is big boost. Within the defence services, capital expenditure has increased by 22% (to Rs 2.19 lakh crore), in comparison to 17% increase in the revenue expenditure (to Rs 3.65 crore). Significantly, much of the growth in the capital expenditure is driven by the capital acquisition or the modernisation budget which has seen a hike of 24% to Rs 1.85 lakh crore.\n\nAir Force gets most of the modernisation funds\n\nAmong the various modernisation budget heads, ‘Aircraft & Aero Engines’ has grown the most—by 31% to Rs 63,734 crore, closely followed by ‘Other Equipment’ which has seen its budget growing by 30% to Rs 82,218 crore. Interestingly, the budget for ‘Naval Fleet’—which caters to acquisition of various ships and submarines—has grown modestly by 3% to Rs 25,024 crore. Considering that Indian navy is at the advanced stage of signing the much awaited $8 billion deal\n\nunder P75I project to acquire eight submarines, the marginal increase in the budget seems inadequate.\n\nMaintaining its focus on indigenization and self-reliance, the MoD has retained the share of the acquisition budget devoted to procurement from the domestic industry at 75%. In other words, domestic industry would be benefited from Rs 1.39 lakh crore worth of capital acquisitions which will come their way in 2026-27.\n\nDRDO gets more attention this yearTo further bolster self-reliance efforts in defence, the budget of the DRDO, which is at the center of India’s defence innovation efforts, has been hiked by 9% to Rs 29,100 crore. Though DRDO’s budget increase pales in front of hikes in the MoD’s overall budget or the capital expenditure/acquisition budget, it nonetheless is a big hike considering the modest increases in its budget in the recent past.\n\nPost-Sindoor, there’s a change in spending\n\nThe 15% increase in the MoD’s overall budget, on the top of the 24% hike in modernisation budget and 75% of modernisation budget for domestic industry, is a clear statement of how the Modi government looks at the country’s security. The big budgetary hike is a much-needed boost to not only replenish the arsenal expended during the Operation Sindoor but to further bolster the country’s security apparatus through greater focus on domestic industry-driven modernisation.\n\n(Laxman Kumar Behera is Associate Professor at Special Centre for National Security Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.)\n\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "Contrary to widespread expectations, the Hon’ble Finance Minister did not announce any changes in personal income tax slab rates in Union Budget 2026. While many taxpayers were hoping for rate cuts or higher deductions, the government instead chose to focus on procedural reforms aimed at simplifying compliance, reducing litigation, and easing the burden on individual taxpayers, especially small taxpayers, as evident from the following proposals.\n\nExtended Filing and Revision Timelines\n\nIn a major relief for taxpayers, filing timelines have been rationalised. For individuals filing ITR-1 and ITR-2, the due date will continue to remain 31 July. However, for non-audit cases involving business or professional income and partners of non-audit firms, the due date has been proposed to be extended from 31 July to 31 August.\n\nAnother key reform relates to timelines for filing of revised returns. Currently, revised and belated returns share the same deadline of nine months from the end of the relevant tax year (i.e., 31 December), leaving no scope for revision, if a belated return is filed at the last moment. To address this anomaly, the government proposes to extend the time limit for filing revised returns, to 12 months, from the end of the tax year (i.e., 31 March), with a nominal fee.\n\nUpdated Returns and Reduced Litigation\n\nThe Budget proposes flexibility in filing updated returns, even in certain reassessment scenarios, subject to payment of additional tax of 10%. Also, such income will not attract penalty. This move is expected to reduce prolonged litigation and encourage voluntary correction of errors.\n\nBuying Property from NRIs Gets Easier with TAN Relaxation\n\nAn important relief has also been announced for home buyers. Going forward, a resident individual or Hindu Undivided Family buying property from a non-resident seller will no longer be required to obtain a Tax Deduction Account Number (TAN) for deduction of taxes. This change, effective from 1 October 2026, removes an unnecessary compliance step.\n\nTo ease cash flow pressures, especially for students and families, a reduction in Tax Collected at Source (TCS) rates has been proposed. Under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme, TCS for education and medical treatment has been reduced from 5% to 2%. Similarly, TCS on overseas tour programme packages has been rationalised to a flat 2%, replacing the earlier slab-based structure.\n\nForeign Assets of Small Taxpayers – FAST-DS 2026\n\nOne of the most significant announcements is the proposed Foreign Assets of Small Taxpayers - Disclosure Scheme, 2026 (FAST-DS 2026). This scheme seeks to address non-disclosures of foreign income or assets by resident taxpayers.\n\nThis proposal owes its origin to the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015, under which a one-time compliance window was offered in 2015. Since then, tax authorities have been observing that non-compliance continues to persist, particularly among small taxpayers who failed to inadvertently disclose foreign assets.\n\nSuch cases commonly include ESOPs or RSUs received during overseas employment, dormant foreign bank accounts held by former students, savings or insurance policies of returning NRIs, or assets held during short-term foreign deputations.\n\nTo address this, the government has proposed a one-time opportunity to declare foreign income or assets that were not reported earlier, with no prosecution exposure if the conditions of the scheme are met with.\n\nIf the total value of undisclosed foreign income and/ or assets is up to INR1 crore, the taxpayer will need to pay 30% tax each on the value of undisclosed income and/ or assets and an equal amount as additional tax. For cases where foreign assets were bought from income that accrued or arose out of India when such a taxpayer was non-resident and the asset was not disclosed in the tax return, a fixed fee of INR 1lakh will be levied, provided the asset value does not exceed INR 5 crore.\n\nRelief from prosecution has also been extended to non-reporting of foreign assets (other than immovable property) of up to INR 20 lakhs retrospectively from 1 October 2024.\n\nOverall, the Budget marks a clear step towards simplification, ease of compliance, and reduced fear of penalties. By addressing long-standing procedural pain points, the Budget aims at moving steadily towards a more trust-based and user-friendly tax administration.",

        "full_content": "Revenue Secretary Arvind Shrivastava on February 1 sought to dispel concerns around the Budget 2026 proposal on taxation of share buybacks, asserting that the move represents a relief for most shareholders and a correction of an earlier anomaly, rather than the introduction of an additional tax.\n\nExplaining the intent behind the proposal, the Revenue Secretary said the buyback taxation framework has been reworked to benefit non-promoter shareholders, while keeping the tax burden on promoters broadly unchanged. “I would like to clarify that it is in fact a relief, it is not an additional tax,” he said, noting that the earlier change had shifted buyback proceeds to dividend income, taxed at applicable income tax rates in the hands of shareholders.\n\n“That is now corrected. We have put the tax at the hands of the shareholder as a capital gains tax, which long term will be only 12.5 percent. That is a correction and relief given to shareholders,” Shrivastava said.\n\nUnder the revised framework announced in the Budget, buyback proceeds will be taxed as capital gains rather than dividend income.\n\nShrivastava said the change addresses the unintended consequences of an earlier redesign of the buyback tax regime, which was aimed at curbing misuse by promoters. “The whole objective at that time was misuse of tax arbitrage by promoters,” he said. In this context, tax arbitrage refers to promoters choosing buybacks over dividends primarily to reduce their tax liability, even though both are mechanisms to return surplus cash to shareholders.\n\nHe said the revised structure ensures that the tax burden on promoters remains broadly unchanged. “As far as promoters are concerned, it is status quo,” the official said. “Today the marginal rate at which they would have been paying the tax as a dividend was at their respective income tax rates. We have kept it at 30 percent for individuals and 22 percent for corporates.”\n\nThe finance ministry has said the additional levy on promoters is intended to neutralise the tax advantage that buybacks offered over dividends, while allowing ordinary shareholders to benefit from capital gains taxation.\n\n“As far as other shareholders are concerned, it is a very big relief,” Shrivastava said. “The decision on buyback tax is a relief. We have corrected it by changing it to capital gains. So we have provided relief to investors.”\n\nTax experts say the move improves clarity and fairness in the buyback taxation regime. “Earlier, share buybacks were taxed mainly at the company level, with shareholders facing uneven or unclear outcomes. After the 2024 change, buyback proceeds are taxed in the hands of shareholders, often at applicable slab rates, on the entire receipt without allowing deduction for the cost of acquisition,” Amit Maheshwari, tax expert, told Moneycontrol.\n\n“In the interest of minority shareholders, the Finance Minister has now proposed to tax buyback proceeds as capital gains for all shareholders, ensuring that tax applies only to the real gain,” he said. “To curb misuse through tax arbitrage, an additional buyback tax has been introduced for promoters, resulting in an effective tax rate of about 22 percent for corporate promoters and 30 percent for other promoters. This aligns buybacks with normal share sales for minority and retail investors while safeguarding revenue.”",

        "full_content": "The Union Budget 2026 may not have delivered sops for the country’s emerging cryptocurrency sector, but it has sent a clear and constructive signal to India’s crypto ecosystem by strengthening the need for accurate and timely reporting of crypto-asset transactions.\n\nThe crypto market continues to hope for tax sops, deductions on gains, as well as policy clarity. Instead, the Budget 2026 proposed strict penalty provisions for crypto exchanges towardsnon-compliance in reporting crypto-assetsunder Section 509 of the Income Tax Act, 2025.\n\nAs per the provision under the said Section 509 of the I-T Act 2025, a penalty applies for failure to furnish the required statement at Rs 200 per day, and Rs 50,000 for providing inaccurate information in a statement of transaction of crypto assets.\n\nCrypto players have welcomed the move, saying that such a provision sends a clear and constructive signal for India’s crypto ecosystem by reinforcing the importance of accurate and timely reporting of crypto-asset transactions.\n\n“By introducing well-defined measures to address non-compliance, the Budget strengthens accountability while bringing digital asset reporting closer in line with established financial standards. Importantly, this clarity enables exchanges and market participants to build compliance frameworks with greater confidence and operational certainty,” said Raj Karkara, COO of ZebPay.\n\nPreviously, the Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND) updated its AML (Anti-money Laundering) and CFT (Countering the Financing of Terrorism) guidelines in January 2026, classifying crypto exchanges and VDA service providers as Reporting Entities under the PMLA Act, 2002 (Prevention of Money Laundering Act).\n\n“Taken together, these measures reflect a cohesive regulatory direction that builds trust, enhances accountability, and supports the long-term, responsible growth of the digital asset industry in India.”\n\nNo changes to TDS on crypto transactions\n\nCurrently, a 1 percent tax deducted at source (TDS) is levied on every cryptocurrency transaction, tying up traders’ capital. The industry has proposed cutting the TDS rate to 0.01 percent on crypto and other virtual digital asset transactions.\n\nThe 1 percent TDS was introduced on July 1, 2022, following the Budget 2022 announcement. Implemented under Section 194S of the Income Tax Act, the provision requires buyers of virtual digital assets to deduct 1 percent TDS on each transaction, which crypto exchanges then remit to the government.\n\n30 percent flat capital gains tax on VDAs\n\nThe Union Budget 2022 also imposed a flat 30 percent tax on gains from virtual digital assets, placing crypto income alongside lottery and gambling winnings under a stricter tax framework.\n\nUnder this rule, profits from cryptocurrencies are taxed at 30% regardless of the holding period. Industry experts say this significantly erodes net returns, particularly for long-term investors who, in other asset classes such as mutual funds, would typically benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.\n\nCrypto industry participants are also calling for a move away from transaction-based taxation to a net-revenue approach that allows losses to be set off.\n\nThey argue that permitting loss set-off would enable investors to offset losses from one crypto asset against gains from other crypto trades, ensuring tax is levied only on net profits. Currently, however, losses from virtual digital assets cannot be adjusted against gains from crypto or any other asset class.",

        "full_content": "Indian stock markets crashed on February 1 after the Union Budget. India VIX, which measures near-term market volatility, jumped nearly 11 percent to 15.09.\n\nAfter Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman concluded her Budget speech, Sensex crashed more than 2,370 points (around 2.9 percent) to hit an intraday low of 79,899.42. Nifty 50 meanwhile plunged nearly 750 points (around 3 percent) to its low of 24,571.75. During this time,India VIXjumped more than 18 percent to hit an 8-month high of 16.11.\n\nThe benchmark indices then staged a strong recovery, followed by sharp crash again. Vix too remained volatile during the session.\n\nAt close,Sensexfell nearly 1,547 points (around 1.9 percent) to end the session at 80,722.94.Nifty 50meanwhile plunged over 495 points (nearly 2 percent) to close at 24,825.45.\n\nA high VIX index after the Budget does not necessarily mean that further crash is imminent, but it does indicate that traders are preparing for volatility rather than a smooth ride, said Pranav Koomar, Founder and CEO of PlusCash.\n\n“VIX measures the volatility of the market over a short term, and if it remains high, it indicates that there is uncertainty about the macroeconomic indicators, fiscal policies, and money flows,” the analyst explained.\n\nWhile the Budget may have addressed key growth and fiscal priorities, a strong volatility index suggests investors remain cautious about near-term triggers such as global interest rate movements, earnings follow-through and geopolitical developments, said Kalp Jain, Research Analyst, INVasset PMS.\n\nKoomar added that stock markets can witness extreme intraday movements in such a scenario. “For investors, this means that they need to focus on quality and stick to their stop-loss strategy,” he concluded.\n\n“A persistently elevated VIX after the Budget signals that markets are still pricing in uncertainty despite the policy clarity provided,” said Kalp Jain, Research Analyst, INVasset PMS, adding that in such phases, markets often become more selective rather than directional.\n\n“For equities, this typically translates into higher stock-specific volatility and sharper reactions to results or news flow, even if the broader trend remains intact,” he further said.\n\nThe analyst however explained that a firm VIX does not necessarily imply a bearish outlook, but it does indicate that confidence has not fully stabilised. “Until volatility eases, markets may continue to see rotational moves, with investors favouring balance-sheet strength, earnings visibility and defensiveness over broad-based risk-taking,” he said.\n\nWhile presenting Budget 2026, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman raised STT on futures to 0.05 percent from 0.02 percent. This was seen as a significant reason for the market crash today, as investors on the contrary had expected significant relief on this front.\n\nFor every Rs 1 lakh worth of futures sold, traders will now pay Rs 20 in STT instead of the previous Rs 12.50, explained Ashish Singhal, Co-founder of Lemonn. For a Rs 10,000 option contract sale, STT increased to Rs 10 from Rs 6.25, he added.\n\n“As the current STT framework does not differentiate between various categories of users or the purpose of derivative usage, genuine hedging activity is subject to the same higher costs as speculative trading. This uniform treatment could discourage some investors from employing prudent hedging strategies, effectively increasing their exposure to market risk and making portfolio protection more expensive,” the analyst said.\n\n\"The steep increase in STT on futures and options, coming on top of last year’s hike, is likely to raise impact costs for traders, hedgers, and arbitrageurs. This could cool derivative activity and lead to a reduction in volumes. The intent appears to be volume moderation rather than revenue maximisation, as any potential revenue gain could be offset by lower derivative volumes,\" said Shripal Shah, MD & CEO, Kotak Securities.\n\nThe absence of significant incentives for foreign investors, who have withdrawn $23 billion from local equities since the start of 2025, also hurt sentiment. \"At a time when India needs to deepen market liquidity and attract global flows, raising frictional trading costs sends the opposite signal,\" said Jimeet Modi, founder and chief executive at SAMCO Group.\n\nFollow allLIVE updateson Budget 2026 here.",

        "full_content": "Capital expenditure allocations in the FY27 Budget show a clear sectoral re-prioritisation, with sharp increases for space, telecom and science-linked ministries, even as traditional heavy industries such as steel, atomic energy and petroleum see sizeable pullbacks.\n\nThe Department of Telecommunications is among the biggest gainers. Its capital outlay has been raised to Rs 47,275 crore in FY27, nearly doubling from Rs 23,916 crore in FY26 (RE). As a share of total capex, telecom's allocation has jumped to 3.9 percent from just 2.2 percent, reflecting a 1.7 percentage point increase—one of the steepest increases across ministries. In absolute terms, telecom capex is up by Rs 23,359 crore year-on-year, with a near Rs 2 lakh crore increase during this period.\n\nSpending on science has also seen a sharp step-up. The Department of Science and Technology (DST) has been allocated Rs 20,085 crore in FY27, compared with just Rs 3,083 crore in FY26 (RE). This translates into a sixfold increase in absolute terms, with its share of total capex rising from 0.28 percent to 1.64 percent, an increase of 1.36 percentage points, the largest proportional jump among all ministries.\n\nDefence-linked capital expenditure continues to rise as well. Capital outlay on defence services has been raised to Rs 2.19 lakh crore in FY27, up from Rs 1.86 lakh crore in FY26, an increase of Rs 32,852 crore. Defence capex now accounts for 17.9 percent of total capital spending, up from 17.0 percent a year earlier.\n\nIn contrast, several traditional infrastructure and commodity-linked ministries have seen allocations shrink.\n\nThe Ministry of Steel has witnessed one of the steepest cuts. Its capex allocation has been slashed to just Rs 3.3 crore in FY27, from Rs 3,020 crore in FY26 (RE). As a share of total capex, steel has dropped from 0.28 percent to near zero.\n\nSimilarly, Atomic Energy has seen its capital allocation reduced to Rs 9,966 crore, down from Rs 12,062 crore last year, a decline of over Rs 2,095 crore, with its share of capex falling from 1.10 percent to 0.82 percent.\n\nThe Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has faced an even sharper contraction. Its capex allocation has been cut to Rs 238 crore in FY27, compared with Rs 1,407 crore in FY26, implying a reduction of over Rs 1,168 crore and a drop in capex share from 0.13 percent to just 0.02 percent.",

The TCS rate on overseas tour packages has been slashed from 5 percent and 20 percent to a flat 2 percent, with no minimum amount condition.\n\nSimilarly, TCS under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) for education and medical purposes has been reduced from 5 percent to 2 percent, easing the upfront tax burden on students, young professionals, and families planning overseas travel or studies.\n\n\"Gen Z in India is significantly more inclined to pursue higher education abroad and travel internationally compared to earlier generations. This reduction will improve liquidity in the hands of Gen Z taxpayers, as a substantial amount that was previously blocked due to higher upfront TCS will now remain available for spending, education financing, and other productive uses.” said Gopal Bohra, Partner -Tax, N.A.Shah Associates.\n\nFor students planning higher education abroad, this matters far more than it sounds. TCS is not an additional tax but an upfront cash outgo that gets adjusted only at the time of filing returns. A lower TCS means less money blocked for months, improving liquidity for families funding tuition fees, accommodation and living expenses.\n\nThe Budget also simplifies TDS and compliance for small taxpayers, a category that includes students, interns and first-time earners.\n\nWith automated, rule-based systems for lower or nil TDS certificates and easier filing timelines, students with stipends, internships, freelance income or scholarships face fewer deductions at source. This reduces the gap between income earned and income received, critical for Gen Z professionals managing rent, gadgets and EMIs early in their careers.\n\nSimply put, less money gets stuck with the tax department, and refunds become less central to cash planning.\n\nCreators, designers and gamers: Turning skills into income\n\nThe Budget also expands non-traditional income pathways. The proposal to set up AVGC Content Creator Labs in 15,000 schools and 500 colleges formalises careers in animation, gaming, VFX and digital content.\n\nFor Gen Z, this translates into:\n\nLower dependency on unpaid internships\n\nHigher potential for freelance and global income\n\nSimilarly, the plan to establish a new National Institute of Design in eastern India strengthens access to high-paying creative professions without forcing migration to metro cities, reducing education and living costs.\n\nSports as a viable financial career\n\nThe launch of the Khelo India Mission reframes sports from a passion project to a structured livelihood. With integrated talent pathways, scientific training, professional coaching and better infrastructure, young athletes gain visibility and income stability earlier.\n\nFor families, this reduces the financial risk of backing a sports career, something that traditionally required heavy personal spending with uncertain returns.\n\nWhat Budget means for Gen Z money planning\n\nBudget 2026 doesn’t hand Gen Z direct tax sops. Instead, it reshapes cash flow, lowers friction costs and broadens earning opportunities. Lower TCS and TDS improve liquidity, while investments in creators, designers and sports professionals expand income diversity.\n\nFor a generation balancing ambition with financial anxiety, the message is subtle but clear: the government is reducing the cost of chasing opportunities, not dictating what those opportunities should be.",

        "full_content": "Every Budget season, we scan the numbers first. Fiscal deficit. Capex. Taxes. They matter, of course. But over time, I’ve found that what shapes markets and portfolios is often not what shouts the loudest, but what stays consistent in the background.\n\nBudget 2026–27 is not a headline-grabber. And that is precisely why it deserves attention.\n\nAt a broad level, the Budget marks a subtle but important shift: from welfare-heavy spending to capability-building. Over the past decade, India has had to prioritise inclusion and income support. This year, the emphasis is clearly on skills, productivity, institutions and ecosystems. Programmes that link education to employment, support the care economy, build university townships and formalise enterprise networks may not show immediate results, but they shape the quality of growth over time. For long-term investors, this signals intent towards growth that is built, not borrowed.\n\nExports are another area where the work is quiet but meaningful. Rationalisation of customs duties across electronics, marine products, leather, textiles and even defence components points to a broad-based competitiveness push. Faster clearances, trusted importer frameworks and electronic sealing may sound operational, but exports are won or lost at the margin. Reducing friction matters as much as incentives.\n\nOne of the more significant themes running through the Budget is the deepening of capital markets beyond banks. Reforms in the corporate bond market, incentives for municipal bonds, and greater use of REITs and InvITs for asset monetisation reflect a deliberate effort to diversify how India funds growth. This has implications for investors too. As markets mature, debt funds, hybrid strategies and income-oriented solutions become more relevant alongside traditional equity allocations.\n\nThe services sector -- long India’s quiet strength -- gets welcome policy certainty. A simplified safe harbour regime for IT services, higher thresholds and five-year visibility reduce litigation risk. Tax holidays for data centres till 2047 recognise the long gestation cycles of digital infrastructure.\n\nAnother notable shift is geographic. Tier II and Tier III cities are no longer peripheral to the growth story. Public capex, MSME support, education hubs and city economic regions are explicitly focused beyond metros. The next phase of consumption and employment growth will come from smaller cities, and investors looking at real estate, infrastructure, retail and financial services should keep that in mind.\n\nAll of this sits within a disciplined fiscal framework. A declining fiscal deficit and sustained public capex without slippage reinforce macro stability. For investors, credibility matters more than drama.\n\nTaken together, Budget 2026–27 feels like a build-for-2047 Budget. Institution-heavy. Ecosystem-led. Reform-continuous rather than announcement-driven.\n\nFor investors, the message is familiar but worth repeating. Markets tend to reward patience, balance and a steady process far more than quick reactions. This Budget does not offer shortcuts or sudden boosts. It offers continuity. And that, in investing, is often an underrated advantage. In such phases, the real work for investors is not prediction, but discipline -- staying aligned to asset allocation, keeping goals in focus, and letting time do its job.",

With the current outdated definition of affordable housing, CREDAI estimates that the segment’s share could decline further from 18 percent to nearly 12 percent of total housing supply. This is a serious warning sign for India’s lower middle class and middle class,\" CREDAI National President Shekhar Patel said.\n\nEight of the ten constituents of the Nifty Realty index ended lower amid sharp selling pressure.Lodha DevelopersandSobhaemerged as major laggards, falling up to 5 percent.\n\nGodrej Properties, DLF, Oberoi Realty and Signatureglobal (India) were among other stocks that declined up to 5 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, some industry players said the Budget’s focus on infrastructure and regional development could support the sector over the longer term.\n\nGurpal Singh Chawla, Managing Director of TREVOC Group, said the emphasis on funding for Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities was a positive step. He noted that the City Economic Regions framework and continued push for capital expenditure would gradually strengthen real estate fundamentals beyond metro markets, though immediate demand impact may be limited.\n\nThe Union Budget 2026 raised public capital expenditure to Rs 12.2 lakh crore and announced the introduction of the Infrastructure Risk Guarantee Fund, reinforcing the government’s focus on infrastructure-led growth.\n\nIndustry players said these measures could improve execution visibility and liquidity across real estate segments. Manoj Gaur, Chairman and Managing Director of Gaurs Group, said the Budget’s emphasis on infrastructure and financial stability would help sustain momentum seen in the sector in recent years.\n\nAmit Modi, Director of County Group, said the Infrastructure Risk Guarantee Fund would improve funding confidence and reduce execution risks for long-gestation projects.\n\nANAROCK Group Chairman Anuj Puri, however, said the Budget provided limited direct relief to the real estate sector, with benefits largely coming through higher capital expenditure and related initiatives in manufacturing, MSMEs, tourism, transport infrastructure and green transition.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The intent is to improve systemic transparency and data quality, not to penalise individual investors,\" he toldMoneycontrol.\n\nWhat did the crypto industry say?\n\nAccording to Edul Patel, CEO, Mudrex, the proposed penalties for non-disclosure and misreporting of crypto assets reflect a “broader policy shift towards strengthening compliance and transparency in India’s digital asset ecosystem”\n\n“This builds on the recently updated FIU-IND guidelines for exchanges. By creating clearer accountability, these measures bring crypto transactions closer to mainstream financial reporting standards,” he said.\n\n\"The Union Budget 2026 proposes strengthening compliance for crypto platforms over lapses in transaction disclosures, aiming to curb tax evasion in virtual digital assets. This requires exchanges to bolster compliance and accurate reporting of user transactions,” said Sumit Gupta, Co-founder CoinDCX.\n\nHe added that the exchange will work closely with policymakers to support the development of an innovative, and globally competitive VDA (virtual digital asset) ecosystem, as the regulatory landscape continues to evolve.\n\nIn the long term, these industry players believe that growth will come not only from innovation but trust and regulatory clarity that such measures bring.\n\nIn January, the Finance Ministry’s Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)issued updated guidelinesto tighten business operation practices, cybersecurity disclosures and KYC norms for VDA companies registering in India.\n\nAs per the updated guidelines, crypto platforms now have to do more than just allow simple document uploads. Users must take a“live selfie”using software that verifies their presence, typically through eye-blinking or head movement to prevent the use of static photos or deepfakes.\n\nExchanges must record the exact latitude and longitude, date, timestamp, and IP address from which a user starts creating an account.",

Yet, India has emerged as a resilient and structurally indispensable economy. Now the fastest growing major economy, all macro-indicators are strong – moderate inflation, elevated consumption, steady investment and consolidation. All these factors point to strength of the economy and its Balance Sheet.\n\nAnd now, the budget pivoted to creating muscle – focusing on emerging strategic sectors, high-value manufacturing, creating global brands, and strengthening its relevance in an increasingly multi-polar world.\n\nAlongside this pivot, the Union Budget 2026 is significant for healthcare. It signals a shift in thinking, positioning health as productive economic infrastructure. For operators, this reframes the risk-reward equation and supports sustained, long-horizon investment.\n\nThis shift is critical as we transition toward longevity and quality of life as core health priorities. NCDs now account for 57% of all deaths, and chronic conditions are placing sustained pressure on healthcare systems. The burden has shifted from episodic care to lifelong management, requiring depth and resilience across the system.\n\nThe Budget responds by strengthening the entire healthcare ecosystem. The Biopharma SHAKTI program strengthens domestic manufacturing of biologics and biosimilars, reducing exposure to global supply disruptions. For hospitals, this enables more predictable access to advanced therapies and greater confidence in scaling complex care models.\n\nThere is a strong focus on Medical Value Travel - Regional Medical Hubs have the potential to reshape growth by integrating care delivery, education, research, and attracting travellers from around the world. India also has a unique opportunity to lead globally by combining cost-effective allopathic and surgical excellence with the indigenous system of Ayurveda, to create a differentiated wellness proposition spanning prevention, treatment, recovery, and long-term well-being.\n\nAI represents the most important inflection point for healthcare. Competitiveness will depend on AI tools trained on Indian populations and indigenous clinical decision systems. Ownership of clinically relevant, India-specific AI will determine where long-term investment flows.\n\nFinally, the sharp focus on creating a strong pool of allied health professional and multi-skilled care givers will give India a human capital edge. This initiative will support India’s own domestic requirements for skilled manpower, while creating a workforce that is capable of healing the world.\n\nTogether, these measures pave the path for us to credibly pursue our well-deserved ambition of contributing 10% of global services by 2047.\n\n(Suneeta Reddy is MD, Apollo Hospitals.)\n\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

UPI MDR was 30 basis points before the government waived it in 2020. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.\n\n\"The UPI transaction value growth has already dropped to 13 percent. And to expand to rural areas and tap the real potential of UPI, you need to invest four-five times this amount. Private companies in the UPI space are unlikely to do that without subsidies,\" said a chief executive with a payment company.\n\nThe Payment Council of India (PCI), which represents payment and fintech companies, was scathing in its comments.\n\n“With Zero MDR of UPI and the Government allocating a mere Rs 2,000 crores for processing 30 crore transactions every day for free, will choke the entire ecosystem for funds for scaling and growth. With these kinds of incentives for the fintech industry, it will be very difficult to get the next set of 300 million (or 30 crore) Indians on the Digital payments bandwagon as well as deploy acceptance mechanisms in the hinterland of our country,\" said Vishwas Patel, Managing Director, AvenuesAI Ltd and chairman of PCI.\n\nTo promote the adoption of digital payments, the government mandated that UPI transactions remain free for users, and in return, it will compensate payment firms for the costs they bear to facilitate them.\n\nPCI was expecting the government incentive to be above Rs 10,000 crores. The industry body noted that increasing deployment and servicing costs, as well as increasing RBI compliance costs, impose a high cost on fintech companies.\n\nMost payment companies are not necessarily asking for subsidies or incentives, but rather MDR on high-value payments at merchant establishments, which can cross-subsidise low-ticket transactions.\n\n\"The only solution is for the government to allow us to charge a low-controlled MDR of 30 BPS on UPI P2M (person-to-merchant) transactions only for merchants with more than Rs. 20 lakhs turnover,\" PCI said.\n\nUPI is the country’s most popular digital payment method, facilitating around 85 percent of all online transactions.\n\nThere are approximately six crore merchants in India that accept digital payments, out of which 90 percent are categorised as small merchants as per the definition of RBI (turnover Rs. 20 lakh and below per annum), with around 50 lakh merchants categorised as large enterprises.\n\n\"Enabling MDR for Rupay Debit and UPI large merchants will ensure sustainable monetisation for service providers without disrupting digital payment adoption at the grassroots level, as the merchants already pay MDR for different payment systems,\" Patel added in the statement.\n\nAccording to payment firms, UPI will continue to be popular with consumers and merchants irrespective of any MDR. Most digital payment methods charge MDR ranging between 75 BPS to 150 BPS.",

He noted that achieving this target requires manufacturing to grow 16 times over the next 22 years. According to him, the budget lays down significant details and infrastructure support that will serve as a \"huge boost\" to the sector.\n\nAnother key theme highlighted by Shah was 'Atma Nirbharata' or self-reliance, which he deemed essential given the current global volatility. He specifically praised the proposed rare earth corridor as a \"great step in that direction.\" Furthermore, Shah commended the budget's commitment to inclusion, pointing to the focus on inclusion, including SMEs, MSMEs, small and marginal farmers, youth, capacity building, and women, as integral components for driving overall economic growth.\n\nRegarding the direct impact on his conglomerate, Shah stated that the budget helps the Mahindra Group remain on its \"very rapid growth path.\" He explained that as the budget enhances India's competitiveness in manufacturing, it enables the group to further its 'make in India for the world' strategy and also attracts more foreign companies to the country. Shah concluded by noting that multiple sectors in which the Mahindra Group operates, particularly its hospitality and logistics businesses, are very well-placed to benefit from the new policies.",

He did flag lack of targeted measures for affordable housing, which he described as being “in free fall since the pandemic”.\n\nAccording to ANAROCK data, the sales share of affordable housing has sharply declined, falling from over 38 percent in 2019 to 26 percent in 2022 and to around 18 percent in 2025.\n\nPuri said the segment was in “urgent need of high-impact interventions”, particularly interest-rate stimulants for buyers and developers, to revive demand and supply.\n\n“The absence of any direct announcement on affordable housing, especially around definition reset or fiscal support, is a disappointment, given its importance for urban housing supply and inclusive growth,” he added.\n\nEchoing similar concerns, CREDAI national president Shekhar Patel said developers welcome the continued emphasis on infrastructure spending but was “deeply disappointed” by the lack of concrete measures for affordable housing.\n\n“With the current outdated definition of affordable housing, CREDAI estimates that the segment’s share could decline further from 18 percent to nearly 12 percent of total housing supply,” Patel said, calling it a “serious warning sign” for India’s lower middle class and middle-class homebuyers.\n\nAffordable housing should not be viewed as a welfare initiative, he said.\n\n“Affordable housing is economic infrastructure. It is a major driver of employment, consumption and social stability,” he said, warning that rising construction costs and land prices, without policy support, are pushing developers away from the segment.\n\nIndustry experts cautioned that a continued decline in affordable housing supply could lead to higher rentals, longer commutes and the expansion of informal housing, undermining the goal of inclusive and sustainable urbanisation.\n\nWhile the Budget’s focus on REIT-led monetisation of CPSE commercial assets, data centres, temple towns and Tier-2 and Tier-3 city growth is expected to boost commercial real estate and urban expansion, developers said affordable housing remains the missing piece in the government’s housing and urban growth strategy.\n\nCREDAI urged the government to give urgent policy attention to affordable housing to prevent long-term structural damage to India’s urban housing ecosystem.",

        "full_content": "Let me start with a disclaimer. If you are looking for short term stock ideas, you are not going to find those here. Not because we have been unable to identify those: our Research team (working on a Sunday from office) has put out their views on that matter. It’s just that there has been a vast increase in the number of market participants in the last few years. All of those have been closely watching the Union Budget speech. We are confident that by the time this article reaches you, the most obvious short term stock ideas are already well priced in.\n\nSo I don’t think the point of this article is to say that this budget is positive for EMS and railway stocks and negative for market participants (brokers, exchanges). That is probably already well known to anyone even casually following the budget in the pink papers and the TV / online equivalents.\n\nHaving had a few hours to absorb the budget speech and the documents, we focus on the long term sector views and the macro- what does this budget mean for the investor.\n\nFirst. Successive governments have diluted the relevance of the budget- and rightly so. The Budget announcement (and the Economic survey which is released on the eve of the budget) is rightly reduced to mostly a statement of Economic policy. One can look for cues on further direction, but economic governance is now an ongoing activity and important announcements now no longer wait for the budget date.\n\n(PS. Having started his career as a consumer analyst, your scribe used to find some joy in watching ITC for cigarette tax changes in the budget. This year with the changes made on new year’s eve, even that excitement was lost).\n\nSecond. With GST and the consistent and incremental devolution of powers to the state and local governments, Union Budgets now address only a part of the state finances. This is yet again, a positive development.\n\nThird. Expecting a big bang budget (similar to 1991) is probably not a fair expectation. A lot of the low hanging fruit has been picked. Driving aspirational real GDP growth of 7-8% CAGR now requires harder administrative and governance reforms like the recent changes in bankruptcy code, reform of land and labour laws and so on. None of these drive earnings or stock prices overnight and hence are not seen as exciting by market participants. However, for long term investors, the government is patiently building the pillars of sustained earnings growth and valuations.\n\nIn this context, what do we make of this budget?\n\nThe budget is a direct reflection of the government’s priorities and reaction to the broader environment- not just the economic scenario.\n\n* For e.g. Volatility on all border fronts in last few years leading to the spike in defence budget\n\n* Insipid private investment cycle leading to consistent chipping away at the hurdles like deregulation, focus on SMEs, rationalization of taxes\n\n* Perception that India is lagging in new global emerging sectors leading to investments in AI, Cloud infrastructure and Data centres\n\n* Increased focus on recent wins leading to measures for EMS, GCCs\n\n* Energy (read forex) self reliance with related benefits on forex shows up in focus on Nuclear power\n\n* Trade promotion through on budget activities like custom duty rationalization and off budget focus on FTAs\n\n* Lessons from the Tariff saga to focus on self reliance on rare earths\n\n* Concerns on market speculation caused the rise in F&O STT. Though we still think there should have been a reduction in LTCG especially for FPIs…. And so on.\n\nIn summary, we think this is a budget of continuity, stability and in some cases (like defence, emerging sectors and geopolitics), a sign that the government has “woken up and smelt the coffee”. As in the case of the crises like the famines of the mid 1960s and the Balance of Payment crisis of 1991, period of geopolitical shock has always led to Indian governments embarking on a decade long reform agenda. We think this is one of those moments.\n\nWe strongly believe in the India story. In that context, the country and its government has dug its heels in and put its head down to embark on a multi-year grind towards building long term drivers of earnings and multiples.\n\nGrind is good, more sustainable than big bangs and we remain bullish on the long term story. Given market valuations which are more than one standard deviation above mean, we stick to our defensive stance and a GARP- stock specific approach based on earnings delivery.\n\nAt this time, the sectors we like are Financials (with a large cap bias notably private banks and insurance) and select Industrials including cement. We are neutral on IT and pharma.\n\nWe would use the ongoing market dislocation to buy these sectors for the long term. We stay away from high multiple sectors with slow earnings growth such as Oil & Gas, metals and the consumption basket.",

        "full_content": "There is a shadow of 16th Finance Commission on Union Budget 2026-27 presented today.\n\nThe Sixteenth Finance Commission (FC-16) report, tabled in Parliament today, covering the period 2026-31, retains the magnitude of tax transfers at 41 percent amidst the grand bargain by the states. It offers a balanced yet cautious approach to India’s evolving fiscal federalism. However, prima facie, incorporating a grand new efficiency variable of “contribution to GDP” in tax transfers formula by 16th FC with 10 percent weightage can raise a question about the ‘economic convergence’ perspectives of a Finance Commission. The Indian states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat which are relatively fiscally rich as well as contribute significantly to GDP. It is intriguing why 16th FC incorporated this new variable, in addition to adjusting the weightage of already existing criterion of per capita income distance ( distance of a State from the high per capita income State) as it can affect the progressivity of fiscal transfers.\n\nIt is heartening to see the retained ecological fiscal transfers ( EFC) which was a radical approach by the 14th FC, along with their path-breaking recommendation for 42 percent of divisible pool as tax transfers . Now with Jammu and Kashmir out to the status of Union Territory (UT), 15th and 16th FC retained the magnitude to 41 %. The UT Finance Commissions regularly appointed by the Ministry of Home, design and determine the intergovernmental tax transfers to UTs in India, which is beyond the purview of 16th FC.\n\nRetaining the states’ share in the central divisible tax pool at 41%, the Commission resists calls for a higher vertical devolution while emphasising fiscal discipline and efficiency in resource allocation. This decision maintains continuity with the Fifteenth Finance Commission amid a clarion call from states for up to 50% arising from their fiscal space crunch and concerns from the Union about constrained fiscal space to maintain macroeconomic stability - with national priorities like defense and infrastructure.\n\nThe recommendation to keep the states’ share at 41% reflects a recognition of competing pressures. States argued for greater resources to fulfill expanded expenditure assignments in health, education, and welfare, while the rising cesses and surcharges—now averaging over 20% of gross tax revenue—that shrink the divisible pool. 16th FC notes that actual transfers, including grants, already exceed 60% of gross tax revenue. However there is heightened volatility in intergovernmental fiscal transfers in India.\n\nCritically, this status quo avoids exacerbating moral hazard. By holding the line, rather than reducing the tax transfer share, 16th FC potentially walked a knife edge equilibrium through a “grand bargain” by the States. However fiscal space crunch still persists in a few States with the abandonment of revenue deficit grants. How the 16th FC addresses the widening subnational fiscal space concerns? Increasing the tied grants can affect the fiscal autonomy of the States and kill the flexibility of finances at the subnational government levels.\n\nHorizontal Devolution: Shifting Towards Efficiency\n\nPopulation 2011 ( 17.5 %) and income distance ( 42.5 %) take the lion share in weightage with 60 percent total. The rest 40 % weightage is equally divided for four variables - demographic transition, forest, area and contribution of a state to GDP.\n\nThe devil lies in details. It is interesting to note that 16th Commission’s horizontal formula introduces a notable tilt towards efficiency, reportedly incorporating a new 10% weight for states’ contribution to national GDP alongside other criteria of income distance, area, climate and demographic performance. This marks a departure from heavier equity focus in prior commissions, where income distance often dominated with 45% in 15th FC. This new criterion of economic growth variable is the function of personal characteristics of 16th FC Chairman Dr Arvind Pangariah who believes in ‘growth’ , recall his stance all the prior debates with Amartya Sen in growth versus equity. Public choice scholars increasingly analyse the personal charecterstics of leaders and their influence on public policy outcomes.\n\nOn equity versus efficiency question, the new GDP contribution criterion rewards economic performance, potentially benefiting high-GDP states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu. However, it risks diluting progressivity, as richer states already enjoy fiscal advantages. Compared to 11th FC to 15th FC ( it was not divisible tax pool , but tax specific shares till 10th FC) which progressively emphasised need-based factors, this shift prioritises incentives for economic growth and tax mobilisation, aligning with global best practices but at the cost of deeper equalisation for poorer states.\n\nLikely losers include low-GDP, high-need states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, though mitigated by retained criteria like income distance. Southern states, having controlled population growth, may see reduced shares based on population 2011 criterion which was given comparatively higher weightage by 16th FC. Though Kerala received 2.382 percent interstate share by 16th FC when compared to 1.92 per cent by 15th FC, it is still less than what 14th FC has assigned which was at 2.50 per cent. The debates persist.\n\nAddressing Demographic Transition and Climate Risks\n\nDemographic change receives nuanced treatment. Building on 15th FC’s total fertility rate (TFR) criterion, the Commission acknowledges risks of overly low fertility leading to ageing populations.\n\nClimate considerations feature through the forest and ecology criterion, retained at 10% for forests. It aligns devolution with environmental externalities, a modest continuity since 14th FC.\n\nFC-16 decisively ends revenue deficit grants, citing persistent dependency and adverse incentives in recipient states. This break from past commissions emphasised fiscal prudence, however it may strain chronically deficit-prone states in the short-term.\n\nLocal body grants emerge as a highlight with substantial allocations however with strong conditionalities - for instance, GIS-based property tax systems, timely audits, performance incentives for urbanisation. These tied funds to third-tier reforms, enhancing grassroots governance and revenue mobilisation—prima facie a “big deal” for decentralised service delivery, but no fiscal autonomy as it is tied.\n\nRetaining 41% vertical devolution and emphasising efficiency in horizontal shares (via GDP contribution) incentivises economic growth and centralised rules for fiscal responsibility, with risks for widening inter-state disparities. The rejection of revenue deficit grants and push for local reforms apparently signaling maturity in federalism, reducing moral hazard while linking funds to outcomes. Time will tell if this balance hold.\n\nTo conclude, along with intergovernmental fiscal transfers, 16th FC also articulated a grand fiscal consolidation path for the States with symmetric fiscal rules for fiscal deficits and public debt trajectory, with Union Government on course to reduce debt to below 50 per cent of GDP by 2030‑31 with reduced roll over risks as India’s external debt is insignificant . Power sector reforms are given emphasis by 16th FC with reducing AT&C losses of DISCOM companies across Indian States.\n\nWith the electoral appeal and ease of disbursement through a well‑developed digital payments system, 16th FC noted that large‑group cash transfer schemes have proliferated. The 16th FC recognised that “the primary role of subsidies and transfers should be to assist the poor. Any other subsidies must be predicated on compelling evidence of externalities. Both the Union and States must review the current schemes to assess whether they meet these criteria. Those that do not should be phased out.”. With elections in anvil, it is tough to undergo this process of cleansing by the Union and State governments to move away from populist announcements.\n\n(Views are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.)",

        "full_content": "Mr Market didn’t have lofty expectations  about the Union Budget of 2026-27, to start with. Even so,  Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman seems to have given enough reason for investors to sulk. At the time of writing, both the benchmark equity indices have slipped about 1.5 percent, with the Sensex having sunk about 1000 points. The bond market, when it opens on Monday, would show its own tantrum by sending yields higher.\n\nThe Union Budget, historically presented on a Sunday this time, had two other negative points to it (the first negative is it being a Sunday!). The finance minister announced a securities transaction tax (STT) hike in futures and options. The STT on futures has been raised to 0.05 percent from 0.02 percent—a staggering 150 percent increase—while that on options has climbed 50 percent, to 0.15 percent from 0.1 percent.\n\nSTT is akin to a taboo word in equity markets. It increases the cost of transacting and will dent trading volume in the futures and options market which was already getting thinner. Even foreign investors thinking about dipping their toes would now want to stay away. When the F&O volumes suffer, so does other segments. That explains why the equity indices fell today. Shishir Asthana brings out the angst of the market in hiscolumn here.\n\nThe second negative was delivered after a lulling reiteration of commitment to fiscal consolidation. Sitharaman pegged the all-important fiscal deficit at 4.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and flagged the shift to debt-to-GDP metric as the anchor for fiscal policy. But she slipped in a market borrowing of Rs 17.3 trillion for FY27, 17 percent higher than that of the current fiscal year. While the fiscal consolidation should get Sitharaman points and keep bond markets relieved, dumping a colossal amount of bonds onto investors is a sure way towards indigestion. As such, the bond market has been reeling under a heavy supply of state bonds this year amid a disappointing liquidity situation.\n\nYields have remained elevated and nothing that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has given has worked on investors. The RBI has bought a record Rs 5.7 trillion worth of bonds this year so far and the new fiscal year’s market borrowing numbers guarantee that the central bank will remain a big buyer of bonds for a longer period of time or risk nullifying the entire impact of a pro-growth monetary policy. But there is a medium term silver lining which we write about in ourbond market piece here.\n\nThere is some discomfort for corporates as well. The budget tweaked the corporate tax regime by changing the minimum alternate tax to nudge companies towards the new regime. Ravi Ananthanarayanan brings all the details and implicationsin his piece here.\n\nThat does not mean that the budget was a disappointment throughout. Markets appreciated the commitment to fiscal consolidation and an improvement in expenditure management. A decline in fiscal deficit for the fifth straight year is laudable even when constrained by a slowing nominal GDP and tax revenues.\n\nInvestors have appreciated the sharp increase in capital expenditure for yet another year. The budget announced several notable infrastructure project intentions, reiterated the policy focus on semiconductors, rare earths and biosimilars and rationalised customs duties on select areas. Sitharaman also announced measures to reduce the pain of American tariffs on labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, and seafood.\n\nHowever, most of these announcements are medium-term in nature and the finance minister tagged the vision of Viksit Bharat in most of them. Visions are long-term and give hope but do not fix today’s problems. One such vision is for banks whichwe detail here. Markets were looking for a ray of sunshine at a time when global developments have cast a dark cloud that refuse to clear.  The finance minister may have done her best, but that may not be good enough for the markets.\n\nThe devil is always in the details and budgets are notorious for burying important details in the fine print. The MC Pro team and our expert contributors are analysing such details; so expect more analysis your way.

While Form 15G applies to individuals below 60 years of age, Form 15H is available exclusively to senior citizens. At present, investors are required to submit these forms separately to each company or intermediary, often resulting in duplication and compliance hassles.\n\nThe proposed change seeks to centralise this process through depositories such as NSDL and CDSL, allowing investors to submit the declaration just once. The depository would then disseminate the information to all companies where the investor holds securities, reducing paperwork and the risk of excess or incorrect TDS deductions.\n\nLt Col Rochak Bakshi, CFP and Managing Director, Trunor Enterprises, said centralising the submission of Form 15G and Form 15H could ease compliance significantly for small taxpayers and senior citizens. “By removing the need to approach multiple companies, the proposal helps investors protect eligible income from unnecessary TDS while reducing administrative effort,” he said.\n\nThe proposal also assumes significance in the post-dividend distribution tax regime, where dividend income is fully taxable in the hands of investors, making timely and accurate submission of self-declaration forms critical to avoid excess tax deduction.\n\nKirang Gandhi, Pune-based financial mentor, said allowing depositories to accept Form 15G and Form 15H could improve overall efficiency in tax administration. “Centralised acceptance simplifies compliance for investors holding shares across multiple companies, reduces paperwork, and lowers the chances of errors in TDS deductions,” he said.",

Analysts have pointed out what bothered the markets, while what triggered pockets of buying during the trading session.\n\nSensex fell nearly 1,547 points (around 1.9 percent) to end the session at 80,722.94. Nifty 50 meanwhile plunged over 495 points (nearly 2 percent) to close at 24,825.45.\n\nWhat’s good in the Budget for the markets?\n\nDespite the sharp selloff, markets did see some recovery in between. This was driven by several positive announcements in the Budget.\n\nBuyback to be taxed as capital gains:\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1 proposed totax buyback for all shareholders as capital gains. She however added that promoters will pay an additional buyback tax.\n\nAmit Gupta, Partner at Saraf and Partners, said buyback taxation was again tweaked back to being characterized as capital gain. \"The buyback taxation regime was revamped in past budgets wherein entire amount received through buy-back was to be taxed as dividend for preventing promoter profit extraction and abuse. This recalcitration as capital gains is a welcome change and would pacify the concerns of taxpayers around buy-back route taxation,\" the expert said.\n\nAs a result, the shares ofIT companies, who are known to have declared most of the major buybacks, gained in trade.Wiproand Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares rose around 2 percent each.

Meanwhile, textile stocks rose after she announced several measures to expand and modernise India’s textile sector, with plans to set up mega textile parks through a challenge mode framework.\n\nFisheries and semiconductor stocks also gained in trade.\n\nWhat’s bad in the Budget for the markets?\n\nWhile presenting Budget 2026, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman raisedSTT on futuresto 0.05 percent from 0.02 percent. This was seen as a significant reason for the market crash today, as investors on the contrary had expected significant relief on this front.\n\nFor every Rs 1 lakh worth of futures sold, traders will now pay Rs 20 in STT instead of the previous Rs 12.50, explained Ashish Singhal, Co-founder of Lemonn. For a Rs 10,000 option contract sale, STT increased to Rs 10 from Rs 6.25, he added.\n\n“As the current STT framework does not differentiate between various categories of users or the purpose of derivative usage, genuine hedging activity is subject to the same higher costs as speculative trading. This uniform treatment could discourage some investors from employing prudent hedging strategies, effectively increasing their exposure to market risk and making portfolio protection more expensive,” the analyst said.\n\n\"The steep increase in STT on futures and options, coming on top of last year’s hike, is likely to raise impact costs for traders, hedgers, and arbitrageurs. This could cool derivative activity and lead to a reduction in volumes. The intent appears to be volume moderation rather than revenue maximisation, as any potential revenue gain could be offset by lower derivative volumes,\" said Shripal Shah, MD & CEO, Kotak Securities.\n\nAs a result of the STT hike, capital markets stocks plunged. MCX shares dropped 12 percent, while Angel One and BSE shares fell more than 8 percent each.\n\nPSU Bank stocks declined sharply, pushing the Nifty Bank index down amid concerns over potential mergers and elevated government borrowing. “Govt has set up a high-level committee to review the banking sector, and this committee could potentially be mandated to look for mergers among public sector banks. Historically, bank mergers tend to create near-term drag on performance,\" said Anand Dama, head, BFSI Research, Emkay Global.\n\nNo major incentive to woo foreign investors:\n\nThe absence of significant incentives for foreign investors, who have withdrawn $23 billion from local equities since the start of 2025, also hurt sentiment. \"At a time when India needs to deepen market liquidity and attract global flows, raising frictional trading costs sends the opposite signal,\" said Jimeet Modi, founder and chief executive at SAMCO Group.\n\nThe shares ofdefence companies also tumbled in tradeas Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s capex plans for the sector failed to meet analysts and industry’s expectations. While presenting Budget 2026, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman pegged FY27 defence expenditure at Rs 5.94 lakh crore, up from Rs 5.68 lakh crore in FY26.\n\nDefence capital expenditure has increased 21 percent year-on-year, with the allocation for defence modernisation seeing a sharper 24 percent rise over last year.\n\nFollow allLIVE updateson Budget here.",

        "full_content": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has proposed several important changes to the direct tax system, announcing thatthe new Income Tax Act, 2025, will be implemented from April 1, 2026. The proposal was made while presenting the Union Budget 2026-27 in the Lok Sabha, marking her ninth consecutive Budget.\n\nThe new law aims to replace the long-standing Income Tax Act, 1961, with clearer language, simpler rules, and easier compliance. The government states that the reform seeks to reduce confusion, resolve disputes, and simplify tax filing for individuals and businesses.\n\nHere is the list of 10 major announcements made in Budget 2026.\n\n1) Reduce TCS for pursuing education abroad\n\nIn her Union Budget 2026-27 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a cut in Tax Collected at Source (TCS) on overseas remittances made under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme for education and medical treatment. The rate will be lowered from 5% to 2%, starting April 1, 2026. The move is intended to ease cash flow pressure on families sending money abroad for studies or healthcare.\n\n2) Belated filers will get time to revise returns\n\nThe proposal seeks to extend the filing deadline for arevised returnfrom nine months to 12 months after the end of the relevant tax year. At present, both belated returns and revised returns share the same deadline of nine months. This means taxpayers who file a belated return near the cut-off date get no real chance to make corrections later. The change aims to fix this issue by giving extra time only for revised returns, while the deadline for belated returns will remain unchanged.\n\n3) STT increase on equity futures\n\nEquity derivatives traders will face a new cost increase due to the announcement of an increase in theSecurity Transaction Taxin the Union Budget. The proposal states that STT on equity futures will rise from 0.02 per cent to 0.05 per cent, and the levy on options trades will go up from 0.1 per cent to 0.15 per cent, making futures and options trading more costly.\n\n4) Income tax rules for SGB to change\n\nAt present, investors who holdSovereign Gold Bondsuntil maturity do not pay capital gains tax on redemption. To remove ambiguity, the government plans to clearly define eligibility for this benefit. Under the proposal, the tax exemption will apply only to investors who purchase SGBs at the original RBI issue price and hold them until maturity. Those purchasing SGBs later in the secondary market may lose this tax advantage and be subject to capital gains tax.\n\n5) Budget 2026 brings back capital gains tax on buybacks\n\nBudget 2026 has restored taxation ofshare buybacks as capital gains, allowing investors to pay tax only on net profits instead of the full proceeds. This corrects a costly anomaly under the current dividend tax system and eases the burden on long-term investors and HNIs. The change also makes buybacks more attractive than dividends. However, a higher capital gains tax has been introduced for promoters to prevent misuse.\n\n6)  Introduction of 6 month foreign asset disclosure scheme for taxpayers\n\nFM has announced aone-time six-month foreign asset disclosure schemeto encourage voluntary compliance. The move allows taxpayers to declare undisclosed overseas income or assets without facing prosecution. Small taxpayers, students, salaried employees and NRIs are the main focus. Fully non-compliant taxpayers with assets up to Rs 1 crore must pay tax and a penalty substitute, while partially compliant taxpayers with assets up to Rs 5 crore can regularise by paying a Rs 1 lakh fee.\n\n7) ITR deadline clarity explained\n\nFM said the July 31deadline for filing ITR-1 and ITR-2 will stay unchangedunder Budget 2026. Non-audit taxpayers, like small businesses and trusts, can file by August 31. Revised returns will be allowed until March 31 with a small fee. The Budget also eases TDS rules for non-resident property transactions and offers a one-time window for foreign asset disclosure.\n\nA scheme for small taxpayers is proposed, under which a rule-based automated process will enable small taxpayers to obtain a lower or nil deduction certificate instead of filing an application with the assessing officer. To ease taxpayers holding securities across multiple companies, the budget proposes enabling depositories to accept Form 15G or Form 15H from the investor and forward it directly to the relevant companies.\n\n9)  Penalties introduced for crypto non-reporting\n\nBudget 2026 proposesstrict penalties for crypto exchangesthat fail to report crypto-asset transactions under Section 509 of the Income Tax Act, 2025. Non-compliance will attract a penalty of Rs 200 per day, while inaccurate reporting can lead to a fine of Rs 50,000. The rules take effect from April 1, 2026, amid concerns flagged by the Central Board of Direct Taxes over undisclosed crypto income.\n\n10)  Property purchases from NRIs become simpler for resident buyers\n\nThe Union Budget 2026 haseased property purchases for NRIsby removing the requirement for resident buyers to obtain a Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number (TAN). Buyers can now deduct tax using their PAN instead. Tax experts say the previous rule caused delays and confusion, especially for one-time buyers. The change is expected to simplify compliance and speed up property registration and transactions.",

Over the last seven Budgets, only two have seen gains of more than 0.3 percent, while several have ended in marginal losses. By comparison, the FY26 Budget saw the Sensex end almost flat, while FY25 and FY24 recorded mild declines of less than 0.2 percent each.\n\nThe sharp contrast becomes clearer when set against the FY22 Budget, when the index surged over 4 percent, its best Budget-day performance in more than a decade, driven by a strong push on infrastructure spending and a benign global backdrop.\n\nHistorically, Budget-day moves have not always been a reliable indicator of medium-term market direction. For instance, the sharp 6.1 percent fall in the FY10 Budget was followed by a strong rally later in the year.",

        "full_content": "The Nifty Bank Index failed to see positives emerge from Union Budget 2026, much like the broader market. While the bell-weathered Nifty index fell 2.33 percent reacting to the budget, the Nifty Bank Index fell 1.2-1.8 percent.\n\nThe index’s intraday drop today reflected immediate selling pressure in financials, especially public‑sector banks, after market participants reacted to tax and policy changes.The Nifty PSU Bank index in particular fell 6 percent.\n\nData from past years' Nifty bank index movement shows that on average, the index's returns on the day of budget have been muted or inconsistent, and while occasional positive sessions occurred, many Budget Days under Sitharaman have lacked strong bullish follow‑through, especially for the banking index.\n\nAlmost all budget sessions had seen the Nifty Bank index end the day trade in red.\n\nThis suggests that since 2019, whenNirmala Sitharamanbegan her tenure as the Finance Minister, Bank Nifty’s reactions on Budget Days have tended to be either weak or slightly negative on the day itself, even though the index’s overall trend outside of those days has been higher.\n\nThat said, on an overall basis, barring the budget day moves, the index has climbed significantly over the years, from roughly 27,000 points in February 2019 to nearly 58,900 points in February 2026. This suggests that the immediate Budget-day reactions frequently reflect tactical repositioning, volatility.\n\n2026's intra-day volatility seen in the Nifty bank index is much in-sync with the moves seen the previous year, 2025.\n\n2025's move is known to be one of the widest swings seen, though at the end of the day, the bank index closed only marginally lower, down about 0.1 percent, unlike 2026's closing level which was 1.2 percent lower than January 30's closing levels.\n\nGoing further back to Budget 2024, data shows that Bank Nifty fell about 0.96 percent on the day the full Budget was presented, indicating a negative reaction from market participants disappointed by the policy mix for the banking and financial sector.\n\nIn contrast, an interim Budget earlier that same month saw a modest 0.42 percent rise on Budget day.\n\nThe 2023 Budget Day also saw a modest negative reaction from Bank Nifty, part of a broader trend in recent Sessions where larger fiscal expectations were not met. Data suggests that in the past few years, both Nifty and Bank Nifty returned modest negative or flat outcomes on Budget days, with declines in some of the most recent sessions (2025, 2024 and 2023).\n\nOn 1 February 2019, before Nirmala Sitharaman assumed office as Finance Minister in May, the broader market, including financials, reacted cautiously to the Union Budget. The Nifty Bank fell roughly 1.1 percent on the day, reflecting modest negative sentiment. At the time, Bank Nifty hovered around 26,700–27,000, riding optimism from easing non-performing assets and healthy credit growth, yet reacting cautiously to policy cues.\n\nThe worst moves though happened in the Covid year of 2020, when the markets faced a sharper negative reaction. Bank Nifty experienced heavy intraday swings during the session, with volatility reaching 3.8 percent high‑low, indicating that banking stocks were particularly sensitive to the early signals of what would soon become the COVID-19 pandemic. The index at this point was around 29,000, up from 2019.",

        "full_content": "The Union Budget 2026 has provided relaxation to a resident buyer purchasing an immovable property from non-resident Indians (NRIs), as they will no longer be required to obtain a Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number (TAN) to deduct tax at source.\n\nEarlier, if a resident individual or HUF bought immovable property from an NRI, they had to obtain a Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number (TAN) to deduct and deposit TDS, which only added an extra burden for buyers.\n\nNow, the Budget 2026 has replaced the requirement of TAN with PAN (Permanent Account Number) for buyers when purchasing an immovable property from NRIs.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, during her budget speech, said, “It is proposed to provide that resident individual, or HUF, shall not be required to obtain a tax deduction and collection account number (TAN) to deduct tax at source in respect of any consideration on transfer of any immovable property by non resident under section 393(2). Instead, the  deduction shall be reported by quoting the PAN in same.”\n\n“Allowing TDS to be deducted and deposited using a PAN-based challan aligns the process with transactions involving resident sellers, and addresses a long-standing compliance bottleneck,” said Jidesh Kumar, Managing Partner, King Stubb & Kasiva, Advocates and Attorneys.\n\nTax analyst reasons that the practice of the TAN requirement had imposed a disproportionate burden on individual and one-time buyers, often leading to delays, procedural errors, and uncertainty around timelines for property registration.\n\nAnkit Jain, Partner at Ved Jain and Associates, said, “Resident individuals and HUFs can now deduct tax using a simple PAN-based form, which is similar to regular domestic property sales, which will expedite property registrations and the transaction process.”\n\nBuying property from NRIs? What buyers need to know about TDS\n\nAlthough the requirement to avail of a TAN has been replaced with a PAN, buyers shouldbe careful when buying property from NRIs.\n\nThe thumb rule is to identify the residential status of an NRI. An Indian citizen with a valid passport is treated as an NRI if they work abroad for more than 182 days in a financial year, with all their investments and transactions in India governed by the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA).\n\nIf the seller fails to disclose his or her NRI status and the buyer treats them as a resident, TDS may be wrongly deducted at 1 percent of the total sale value under Section 194-IA, a provision that applies only to resident sellers.\n\nAlso, if the property is held for over two years, it is treated as a long-term asset and attracts 12.5 percent TDS on capital gains for buyers, plus surcharge and cess. For properties sold within two years, the gains are short-term, with TDS rising to 30 percent, along with surcharge and cess.\n\nAccording to a tax analyst, a carefully drafted sale agreement is also essential, clearly outlining the TDS clause and the obligations of both parties.",

        "full_content": "When you file your income tax return, you likely think only about how much tax you owe. But what actually reduces your tax is governed by three distinct concepts: tax exemptions, tax deductions and tax rebates.\n\nThough these terms are often used interchangeably in casual conversation, they work very differently in thetaxcomputation process. Understanding the difference can help you plan your finances better and reduce your overall tax liability.\n\nLet’s break them down in simple, practical terms.\n\nTax exemption: What you don’t include in taxable income\n\nIncome tax exemptions apply to particular sources of income, not to an individual’s total earnings. In simple terms, you do not have to pay any tax for income coming from that source. For instance, agricultural income is fully exempt under the income-tax law. Similarly, long-term capital gains from the sale of a property can be exempt if the money is reinvested in another residential property or in specified bonds within a certain period of time.\n\nFor salaried individuals, house rent allowance (HRA) forms part of the salary structure and can be claimed as a tax-exempt component. Eligibility for HRA benefits requires being a salaried individual with HRA in the salary and renting accommodation.\n\nWhen you calculate your gross total income, certain items may be excluded right at the start. These include:\n\nHouse Rent Allowance (HRA), subject to conditions\n\nLeave Travel Allowance (LTA), under specific rules\n\nCertain allowances for education, transport, etc.\n\nExemptions are applied before you even start calculating the tax.\n\nExample: If your salary is Rs 10 lakh and HRA of Rs 2 lakh is exempt, your taxable income starts at Rs 8 lakh, not Rs 10 lakh.\n\nTax Deduction: What you subtract from your total income\n\nUnlike an exemption, income tax deductions are claimed from the gross total income. Certain specified investments and expenditures are considered to claim deductions. For example, investments in eligible mutual funds, interest paid on educationloans,and premiums paid for medical insurance.\n\nIn the new tax regime flat standard deduction of Rs 75,000 is available to salaried employees.\n\nCommon deduction sections under the old tax regime\n\nSection 80C: Investments like PPF, EPF, ELSS, life insurance, up to Rs 1.5 lakh\n\nSection 80D: Health insurance premiums\n\nSection 80E: Interest on education loans\n\nSection 24(b): Interest on home loan for self-occupied property (up to Rs 2 lakh)\n\nIf your total income is Rs 12 lakh and you claim Rs 1.5 lakh under Section 80C, your taxable income becomes Rs 10.5 lakh.\n\nTax Rebate: What reduces the tax you actually pay\n\nA tax rebate comes into play after your tax is computed on taxable income. A tax rebate refers to a relief that allows ataxpayerto reduce the tax payable at the time of filing the income-tax return, subject to meeting the prescribed eligibility conditions.\n\nSection 87A: Available to resident individuals\n\nIf your taxable income is below a specified threshold, you get a rebate that reduces your tax payable up to a maximum limit.\n\nSuppose your tax comes to Rs 25,000 for the year. If you are eligible for a rebate of Rs 20,000, your final tax payable becomes Rs 5,000.\n\nRebates reduce the tax you owe, not the income on which tax is calculated.\n\nOrder of implementation: Exemption → deduction → rebate — determines how much tax you ultimately pay.\n\nTaken together, exemptions, deductions and rebates work at different stages of tax calculation, but all play a role in lowering the final tax outgo. Knowing how each applies helps taxpayers move beyond headline Budget announcements and accurately assess what actually changes for them. A clear understanding of these concepts also makes it easier to plan income, investments and expenses through the year, rather than leaving tax decisions for the last moment.",

Crucially, once this updated return is filed, the assessing officer is mandated to use only this document for the remainder of the proceedings, effectively short-circuiting potential years of legal disputes.\n\n“If an updated return is filed after receiving Notice u/s 280, it must be filed only in the manner specified in the notice, no alternative route allowed. Further, such updated return will attract additional 10 percent tax over and above tax + interest. Relief: No penalty u/s 439 on income for which this additional tax is paid,” said Himank Singla, Founding Partner, SBHS & Associates.\n\nAn Updated Return allows you to update your tax return even after the deadlines for \"Original,\" \"Belated,\" or \"Revised\" returns have passed. It is designed to encourage voluntary compliance and help you avoid legal notices by reporting income you might have missed.\n\nExtension of scope for filing updated returns\n\nTaxpayers are currently allowed to file an updated return to disclose additional income within four years from the end of the relevant assessment year. This comes with an incremental additional tax liability of 25 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent, and 70 percent from the first to the fourth year, respectively.\n\nTo further reduce litigation, it is proposed that taxpayers be permitted to file an updated return even after reassessment proceedings have begun. In such cases, an additional tax of 10 percent over and above the applicable rate for the relevant year would be levied.\n\nThe proposal also allows taxpayers to file an updated return in situations where they reduce the quantum of loss originally reported, including cases arising under Section 263(1).\n\nFurther, where additional income is disclosed through an updated return, no penalty will be imposed on such income.\n\nRetrospective Immunity for Foreign Assets\n\nRecognising the challenges faced by small taxpayers and the Indian diaspora, the FM proposed immunity for foreign holdings.\n\nRs 20 Lakh Threshold: Non-immovable foreign assets with an aggregate value of less than Rs 20 lakh will now receive immunity from prosecution.\n\nRetrospective Effect: This relief is applied retrospectively from October 1, 2024, effectively shielding thousands of small investors and tech professionals from past non-disclosure penalties.\n\nMisreporting Amnesty: The existing immunity framework for \"underreporting\" has been extended to \"misreporting,\" provided the taxpayer pays 100 percent of the tax amount as an additional income tax.",

        "full_content": "The Union Budget announced today marks an important inflection point for India’s electronics and semiconductor sector, reinforcing the country’s transition from policy intent to large-scale execution. Building on the momentum created under theIndia Semiconductor Mission (ISM), ECMS and allied ESDM initiatives, the Budget sends a strong message of continuity and confidence to global and domestic industry stakeholders.\n\nOver the past year, India has clearly moved from aspiration to credibility, emerging as a serious and investible destination for electronics and semiconductors. As the ecosystem now enters a critical phase of execution and scale-up, sustaining policy momentum has become essential—and the Budget addresses this requirement squarely.\n\nISM 2.0: From fabs to full value-chain ambition – policy continuity\n\nOne of the most significant signals from the Budget is the Finance Minister’s articulation ofISM 2.0 as a semiconductor policy focus. This reflects a maturing vision that moves beyond a fab-centric approach to a full value-chain strategy. The expanded scope—covering semiconductor equipment, materials, chemicals, gases, Indian IP, design tools, R&D, training, and supply-chain resilience—is critical if India is to transition from being a participant to a structural player in the global semiconductor ecosystem.\n\nFor India, the ambition is no longer limited to manufacturing chips alone, but to develop capabilities across upstream and high-value segments that define long-term competitiveness and strategic autonomy. While further clarity on the quantum and structure of ISM 2.0 funding will be important, the policy signal itself is a strong positive for industry confidence.\n\nElectronics manufacturing gets a decisive boost\n\nEqually important is the sharp focus on the electronics ecosystem. Theenhancement of the Electronic Component Manufacturing Scheme (ECMS) to ₹40,000 crorereflects the strong response the scheme has received and its central role in driving electronics value addition. Measures such as emphasis on value addition, customs simplifications, SEZ-to-DTA support, capital goods incentives, MSME-focused interventions, and ease of doing business reforms provide continuity and predictability to electronics manufacturers.\n\nThe alignment of ECMS with PLI objectives strengthens the domestic component ecosystem and helps India move decisively beyond assembly-led manufacturing. This is already translating into stronger electronics exports and growing global acceptance of India-made products.\n\nTechnology, research and talent at the core\n\nThe Budget’s emphasis ontechnology adoption and capability buildingis another critical pillar. Industry-led research and training, job creation, and focused initiatives such as the AI Mission, Quantum Mission, and RDI funding recognise that advanced electronics and semiconductors are deeply intertwined with frontier technologies.\n\nClosing the skills gap will require a shift from purely academic training to industry-integrated models that provide real “fab-floor” and manufacturing exposure. The success of the C2S programme, with over 65,000 students enrolled, demonstrates progress on the design side. The next phase must focus on manufacturing-oriented skilling and workforce development—an area where industry bodies such asIESAand SEMI are already defining structured roadmaps.\n\nExecution discipline will define success\n\nIndia’s ambition under ISM 2.0 is necessarily broader and more complex. The challenge now lies in execution discipline—phasing scale-up in line with ecosystem readiness, ensuring faster approvals, and maintaining close synchronisation between government and industry. Capital availability is no longer the primary constraint; rather, success will depend on knowledge-capital, process discipline, global partnerships, and early anchor customers who can help stabilise new manufacturing lines.\n\nSimilarly, India’s rare-earth ambitions will be judged not by resource availability alone, but by downstream processing, quality consistency, and long-term offtake arrangements that integrate these resources into global supply chains.\n\nTaken together, the Budget measures consolidate recent gains, accelerate execution of approved projects, deepen domestic value addition, and further establish India as a globally competitive and trusted hub for electronics and semiconductor manufacturing. They also lay a strong foundation for meeting a significant share of domestic semiconductor demand through local design and manufacturing in the coming years.\n\nImportantly, the Budget reflects the sustained and applied efforts ofMinistry of Electronics and Information Technology( and ISM ) in working closely with industry to translate vision into execution. The next phase will depend on continued collaboration, predictable policy support, and relentless focus on delivery—turning India’s semiconductor ambition into scaled, globally relevant outcomes.\n\n(Ashok Chandak, President, IESA.)\n\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

In an interview with CNBC TV18, Ramamurthy addressed market concerns, suggesting the policy change will encourage a shift from short-term trading to long-term equity investment, ultimately benefiting the Indian economy.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the market is 'a little worried' about the hike, Ramamurthy presented a positive outlook. He argued that the government's intention is to align and orient people towards long-term equity investing. \"Today the equity STT will be lower than F&O STT, which encourages them to get into the equities market. That is totally in alignment with the capital formation requirement of Viksit Bharat,\" he explained.\n\nWhen pressed on the near-term impact on the BSE's business and trading volumes, Ramamurthy said it was not possible to quantify the impact, arguing that markets are dynamic. He emphasized the dynamic and growing nature of the Indian market, suggesting that any initial negative reaction would be short-lived. \"We are presuming a static thing of a change will have an impact on a dynamic thing. And the market is dynamic and growing,\" he stated.\n\nDrawing on historical precedent, the BSE chief noted that this is not the first time such a tax increase has occurred. He recalled that in the past, the market has taken these changes in its stride and continued to grow without any significant, lasting dip in activity. \"I don't think there has been any dip. The market has taken it in its stride and it has grown. So I feel that the same thing will happen,\" Ramamurthy asserted.\n\nOn other matters from the Union Budget, when asked about measures to attract Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), he highlighted existing government efforts in addressing tariffs in key sectors like textiles and semiconductors as positive developments.\n\nRamamurthy also commented on the recent regulatory approval for the National Stock Exchange's (NSE) initial public offering (IPO). He offered congratulations to the rival exchange and commended the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for delivering the necessary No-Objection Certificate (NOC) within the stipulated time. \"We are extremely glad and happy, and we wish all the best to NSE,\" he concluded.",

        "full_content": "On our India Budget Strength Index, this budget scores 4/10. It is a largely defensive budget—successful in preserving fiscal stability, but one that misses a critical opportunity to strengthen India’s capital-market competitiveness and growth appeal.\n\nWhile fiscal discipline remains intact, the budget loses meaningful points on Global Capital Attractiveness, primarily due to the increase in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on derivatives.\n\n* STT on futures has been raised from 0.02% to 0.05% of contract value\n\n* STT on options premium increased from 0.10% to 0.15%\n\nThese changes materially raise the cost of derivatives trading per transaction. This is not a marginal or technical tweak—it directly impacts market microstructure.\n\nWhy the STT Hike Matters: The Impact Chain\n\nThe second-order effects are critical:\n\nLower cash market participation->\n\nHigher liquidity premium demanded by global investors->\n\nHigher cost of capital for India->\n\nGradual capital reallocation to competing markets\n\nDerivatives markets are not merely speculative venues. They are liquidity engines, hedging mechanisms, and price-discovery tools that underpin the cash market. Weakening this ecosystem has consequences far beyond F&O traders.\n\n• Active and high-frequency traders face a materially higher tax burden on every trade. Given the high turnover nature of derivatives, even modest STT increases can erase strategy profitability, raising breakeven thresholds.\n\n• Hedging costs rise, discouraging efficient risk management via futures and options.\n\n• Arbitrage margins compress, particularly in already tight pricing environments.\n\n• Retail traders, many operating with thin per-trade profitability, are likely to reduce trade frequency and position sizes.\n\nHistorically, higher transaction costs correlate strongly with lower volumes. In India’s case, liquidity—especially in the F&O segment—is heavily driven by short-term participation. Higher friction can suppress derivatives activity by up to ~30% from current levels, with spillover effects into the cash market.\n\nFor foreign participants, the response is even simpler: capital migrates to jurisdictions where friction is lower and market access cleaner.\n\nIndia competes for global capital against the U.S., ASEAN economies, and other emerging markets. At a time when India needs to deepen liquidity and attract global flows, increasing trading friction sends the wrong signal.\n\nFor years, India has operated under the assumption that foreign capital will return naturally—driven by demographics, GDP growth, and a compelling long-term narrative. But global capital does not invest in stories. It invests in risk-adjusted returns, measured in USD terms.\n\nOn that front, the data offers a stark warning.\n\nOver the past 14+ years, Indian equities (NIFTY, USD returns) have delivered consistently inferior rolling returns on both 1-year and 3-year horizons when compared with the three most influential U.S. benchmarks - S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Russell 2000.\n\nMore concerning than lower returns is higher risk. Indian equities have exhibited:\n\n• Greater volatility for inferior reward\n\nIn contrast, US indices delivered higher CAGR, stronger rolling returns, and materially superior risk-adjusted performance.\n\nFor a global allocator—whether a pension fund, sovereign wealth fund, or institutional CIO—the implication is clear:\n\nThere is no portfolio-level compulsion to allocate incremental capital to India.\n\nThe STT hike on derivatives only exacerbates this disadvantage, increasing friction at precisely the wrong point in the cycle.\n\n• Capital-market competitiveness: Diluted\n\n• Cost of capital: Likely to rise at the margin\n\nThis budget protects the sovereign balance sheet—but under-delivers on positioning India as a globally competitive capital market.\n\nStability delivered. Market competitiveness compromised.",

While the government avoids any adverse changes, it also refrains from announcing higher exemptions or senior-specific deductions, retaining the existing tax structure for elderly taxpayers.\n\nNo new tax gains for senior citizens\n\nBudget 2026 offers no fresh tax concessions for senior citizens,keeping existing income tax exemption limits unchanged under the old regime - Rs 3 lakh for those aged 60-79 years and Rs 5 lakh for individuals aged 80 and above. There are no dedicated healthcare deductions or inflation-linked relief measures introduced for retirees.\n\nIndustry experts note that long-pending demands such as expanded medical expense relief under Section 80DDB, tax incentives for in-home elder care and higher social security pensions remain unaddressed.\n\n“This continuity provides stability but overlooks rising costs for this demographic,” says Lt Col Rochak Bakshi, CFP & MD, Trunor Enterprise, adding that fixed-income retirees continue to face pressure from healthcare inflation.\n\nInterest and rental income rules remain unchanged\n\nThe Budget does not announce any changes to Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) thresholds on interest income for senior citizens, nor does it revise existing deduction limits on deposit earnings. Interest income beyond current thresholds continues to attract TDS, often resulting in refund claims during return filing.\n\nSimilarly, TDS provisions on rental income remain unchanged. Tenants will continue to deduct tax once prescribed limits are crossed, keeping cash flows for senior citizen landlords broadly the same as in previous years.\n\nWhile direct tax relief is absent, Budget 2026 makes notable announcements in the healthcare space, which experts say could have long-term relevance for senior citizens. The government announces NIMHANS 2.0 and the upgrade of regional mental health institutes in locations such as Ranchi and Tezpur.\n\nWith India’s ageing population and a rise in dementia, depression and age-related mental health challenges, the move is seen as a step towards strengthening geriatric and mental healthcare beyond major urban centres.\n\n“The announcement of NIMHANS 2.0 and the upgrade of regional mental health institutes is a quiet but powerful step,” says Vijay Maheshwari, CWM®, Founder of Stocktick Capital. “This move acknowledges that healthcare is not just physical, mental well-being matters equally, especially for senior citizens and caregivers.”\n\nA key structural reform announced in Budget 2026 is the replacement of the Income Tax Act, 1961 with the New Income Tax Act, 2025, effective April 1, 2026. The new law aims to simplify tax compliance through shorter and clearer legislation, simplified return forms, easier refund claims and reduced litigation.\n\n“For elderly taxpayers who struggle with complex digital filings, this is a huge relief. The message is clear: tax compliance should not feel like punishment,” Maheshwari adds.\n\nWhat senior citizens expected before Budget 2026\n\nAhead of the Budget, senior citizens and tax experts had hoped for higher basic exemption limits, enhanced healthcare deductions and age-specific relief under the new tax regime. With medical and living costs rising steadily, many had expected inflation-adjusted support for retirees, expectations that Budget 2026 ultimately does not meet.",

Subrahmanyam, the Chief Executive Officer of Niti Aayog, has characterized the fiscal blueprint as a 'services budget' designed to propel the nation towards its 'Viksit Bharat' goal. Speaking with CNBC TV18, Subrahmanyam explained that this budget builds upon the foundations laid by previous budgets, which focused on jobs and manufacturing, by placing a significant new emphasis on the services sector.\n\nSubrahmanyam labelled it a 'services budget' and detailed several key announcements to support his assessment. He highlighted the proposed establishment of a high-level standing committee on services, which is expected to drive reforms across more than 30 ministries. \"If there is one big area of focus in this budget, it is services,\" he stated. The Niti Aayog CEO pointed to a slew of initiatives, including the development of five medical hubs to boost medical tourism, the creation of five 'university cities' to serve as integrated education hubs with research parks and manufacturing, and a major push for tourism and Ayush, with three new All India Institutes of Ayush planned. He also noted the focus on the 'orange economy' through the Indian Institute of Creative Technology and the goal of making India a global services hub, targeting 10% of the world's services output.\n\nWhile championing the services focus, Subrahmanyam clarified that manufacturing continues to be a priority. He explained that the budget builds on the work of the previous year's National Manufacturing Mission, which he said is in its final stages. Key manufacturing-related announcements include the expansion of the electronic component scheme from ₹25,000 crore to ₹40,000 crore and a continued emphasis on labour-intensive sectors like textiles and sports goods, alongside a new container program.\n\nOn the taxation front, Subrahmanyam observed that the government has opted for 'tinkering' to remove 'minor pain points' for businesses rather than pursuing broad import duty rationalization, noting that numerous Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) are already lowering tariffs. A key measure targeting foreign direct investment is the expansion of 'safe harbor' rules for companies with turnovers up to ₹2,000 crore, with a fixed rate of 15%. This move is expected to benefit approximately 1,600 Global Capability Centers (GCCs). He also mentioned the establishment of a committee to review foreign exchange debt borrowing rules, aiming to attract debt flows in addition to equity investments.\n\nSignificant infrastructure development was another core pillar identified by Subrahmanyam. He detailed the plan for 'City Economic Regions,' a Niti Aayog initiative backed by a ₹5,000 crore challenge fund, which he said could help cities like Mumbai and Surat aspire to become global hubs. A major connectivity project announced is a new East-West dedicated freight corridor from Dankuni (near Kolkata) to Surat. \"This is going to give a big boost to industrial and other services growth in Eastern India,\" he remarked. The budget also reinforces the commitment to seven high-speed rail corridors.\n\nRegarding the proposed restructuring of Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and Rural Electrification Corporation (REC), Subrahmanyam said he would need more clarity, but viewed the move as potentially enabling to funnel green and climate finance into India's energy and transport sectors.",

        "full_content": "With Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman leaving the new tax regime largely unchanged, the decision between the old, exemption-driven system and the new, lower-rate structure continues to come down to simple arithmetic.\n\nThe data by Deloitte India clearly shows that the decision depends on one thing: whether deductions under old tax regime are large enough to offset the lower slab rates available under the new tax regime.\n\nAt the lower end of the income scale, the choice is straightforward. For gross salaries up to Rs 5 lakh, tax outgo is zero under both regimes, as taxpayers are eligible for a 100 percent rebate under Section 87A, capped at Rs 12,500 under old tax regime for income upto Rs 5 lakh. Under the new tax regime, this rebate is significantly higher up to Rs 60,000 for income up to Rs 12 lakh, effectively eliminating tax liability within that threshold.\n\nBetween Rs 7 lakh and Rs 10 lakh, the numbers highlight a critical threshold. While the new tax regime offers lower rates, the old regime can still result in zero tax but only if deductions ranging from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 4.5 lakh are available.\n\nThis “deduction equaliser” represents the minimum deductions required to make the old regime competitive. For instance, at a gross salary of Rs 10 lakh, deductions of around Rs 4.5 lakh are needed under the old regime to reduce taxable income to Rs 5 lakh and eliminate tax liability.\n\nStructurally, the two regimes are designed for different taxpayers. The old tax regime works best for individuals who can claim multiple deductions, such as Section 80C investments, HRA exemptions, home loan interest on self-occupied property, health insurance premiums and other allowances. These deductions significantly reduce taxable income, allowing the old regime to stay relevant despite higher slab rates.\n\nIn contrast, the new tax regime is tailored for taxpayers without such deductions such as first-time earners, individuals without housingloans,or those who prefer liquidity over long-term tax-saving commitments. For them, the advantage comes from lower tax rates, a higher standard deduction and simpler compliance, often resulting in similar or lower tax outgo without complex paperwork.\n\nAs income rises beyond Rs 12–13 lakh, the breakeven point becomes sharper. At a gross salary of Rs 13 lakh, both regimes lead to the same tax outgo of Rs 25,000, but only if deductions of nearly Rs 6.9 lakh are claimed under the old regime. From this level onward, the data shows that unless deductions exceed Rs 7–8 lakh, the old regime offers no real tax advantage.\n\nFor income of Rs 25 lakh and above, the deduction equaliser stabilises at around Rs 8 lakh. This means taxpayers need to consistently claim deductions of that magnitude across investments, housing and insurance for the old regime to merely match the new regime. Without such deductions, the new regime clearly emerges as the better choice due to its lower effective rates and simpler structure.\n\nAt higher income levels, Rs 50 lakh and above, the comparison becomes even more rate-driven. The data indicates that tax liability under both regimes is broadly similar up to Rs 5 crore, provided deductions touch the Rs 8 lakh mark under the old regime. At Rs 6 crore, however, the new tax regime shows a lower tax outgo, as surcharge rate will be restricted to 25 percent under new regime.\n\nThe takeaway is clear. The old tax regime suits taxpayers with large, reliable deductions, while the new tax regime rewards those without them through lower rates and ease of compliance. The right choice is not emotional it is numerical.",

        "full_content": "Budget 2026 meaningfully strengthens India’s electronics manufacturing and semiconductor ecosystem, marking a clear transition from assembly-led growth to full-stack capability creation. The launch of Semiconductor Mission 2.0 (ISM 2.0), alongside a near-doubling of the Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme outlay to Rs.40,000 crore, underscores the government’s intent to localise equipment, materials, components, and semiconductor IP. This policy push is reinforced by hard fiscal backing, with government semiconductor spending raised to Rs.8,000 crore in FY27 (from Rs.4,300 crore) and the MeitY allocation increased to Rs.21,633 crore, improving execution visibility. Further, BCD on mobile phones, PCBA, and chargers has been reduced from 20% to 15%, enhancing cost competitiveness and supporting deeper domestic value addition. Along with BCD exemptions across semiconductor & display manufacturing, solar equipment, and consumer electronics have been extended up toFY28, covering key machinery, components, and inputs. This provides long-term capex visibility for fabs and ensures cost stability while accelerating localisation for EMS and appliance players.\n\nOn-ground traction is visible. Across three rounds of ECMS approvals, cumulative investment commitments stand at ~ Rs.54,500 crore, spanning PCBs, camera modules, display and copper clad laminates, and advanced components. Among listed players,Kaynes Technologyhas emerged as a key early beneficiary with approvals across multi-layer & HDI PCBs, camera modules, and copper clad laminates, positioning it well for backend semiconductor and high-value EMS.Amber Enterpriseshas secured broad approvals via subsidiaries and JVs across multilayer and HDI PCBs, strengthening backward integration. A 10% import duty on AC components (excluding indoor and outdoor units) is also supportive for domestic manufacturers, benefiting Amber Enterprises.Syrma SGS Technologyhas approvals for multi-layer PCBs and camera modules, with upside pending approvals in HDI/flex PCBs and laminates, whileDixon Technologieshas approvals for camera modules and optical transceivers, with additional component categories still under evaluation.\n\nParallelly, large integrated initiatives led byTata Electronicsand OSAT players are moving from construction to commissioning, with 10 semiconductor manufacturing and packaging projects approved involving ~ Rs.1.6 lakh crore of investments. With mobile manufacturing already scaling nearly 30x to Rs.5.45 lakh crore in FY25, Budget 2026 materially improves the long-term earnings and margin visibility for India’s EMS and semiconductor value chain.",

        "full_content": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has announced a proposal to widen the window for revising income tax returns, allowing taxpayers extra time to fix mistakes. Speaking during the Union Budget presentation, she said returns could now be revised until March 31, instead of the earlier December 31 cut-off, with a small fee, easing the pressure on those who miss the initial deadline.\n\nSection 263 of the Income-tax Act, 2025 (‘ITA 2025’) [corresponding to section 139 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (‘ITA 1961’)] provides for a statutory framework prescribing the classes of persons required to file returns, the applicable due dates, and the various categories of returns that may be furnished, including original returns, belated returns, revised returns, and updated returns.\n\nSection 263(5) of the ITA 2025 (corresponding to section 139(5) of the ITA 1961) provides for the filing of a revised return of income. It permits a person who has furnished a return under section 263(1) or section 263(4) – Belated Return of the ITA 2025 (corresponding to sections 139(1) and 139(4) of the ITA ) to revise such return upon discovery of any omission or wrong statement in the original or belated return.\n\nUnder the existing provisions, such revised return is required to be furnished within nine months from the end of the relevant tax year, or before completion of assessment, whichever is earlier. The scope of section 263(5) (corresponding to section 139(5) of the ITA 1961) enables taxpayers to file a revised return in order to rectify omissions or incorrect statements relating to income, deductions, exemptions, losses, or other particulars disclosed in the return of income.\n\nCA (Dr.) Suresh Surana said, \"It is proposed to extend the prescribed time limit for filing a revised return from the existing nine months to twelve months from the end of the relevant tax year.\"\n\n\"At present, the time limits for filing belated returns and revised returns coincide, both being nine months from the end of the tax year. As a result, taxpayers filing a belated return towards the end of the permitted period do not have any effective opportunity to revise such return. The proposed extension seeks to address this practical constraint by allowing an additional window only for revised returns and not for belated returns,\" added Surana.\n\nAccordingly, section 263(5) of the ITA 2025 is proposed to be amended to increase the time limit for filing a revised return to twelve months from the end of the relevant tax year. Further, it is proposed to levy a fee under section 428(b) of the ITA 2025 for revised returns filed more than nine months after the end of the relevant tax year.\n\nThese amendments will take effect from 1 April 2026 and shall apply in relation to tax year 2026–27 and subsequent tax years.",

        "full_content": "Even as the government has stepped up capital expenditure for the first time in FY27 and raised its market borrowing programme, the underlying financing math suggests limited stress on public finances and bond markets.\n\nOn the face of it, market experts note that the headline gross borrowing number at Rs 17.2 crore for FY27 appears elevated. However a closer look shows that a significant portion is earmarked for refinancing past liabilities rather than funding fresh spending, with divestments and small savings expected to bridge the remaining gap. The maturities worth Rs 5.47 lakh crore is lined up in FY27.\n\nThe Centre has pegged net market borrowing at Rs 11.7 lakh crore for FY27, around Rs 50,000 crore higher than FY26, reflecting a calibrated increase to support higher capital spending. Gross market borrowing, however, has been set at Rs 17.2 lakh crore, a sharp jump from the current year. This increase is largely explained by the maturity profile of government securities, with redemptions in FY27 estimated at Rs 5.47 lakh crore.\n\nThe gap of about Rs 5.5 lakh crore between gross and net borrowing broadly mirrors these redemptions, indicating that rollover requirements, rather than incremental fiscal slippage, are driving the higher gross numbers.\n\nOn the spending side, the government has budgeted capital expenditure of Rs 12.2 lakh crore for FY27, marking a continued push towards growth-supportive public investment.\n\nThe difference between capex and net market borrowing, therefore, is a relatively modest at Rs 50,000 crore; a gap which experts say is well within manageable limits.\n\nThis is expected to be financed through higher divestment receipts, with the government raising its divestment target to Rs 80,000 crore, alongside robust collections under small savings schemes, which have remained a stable source of funding in recent years when the interest rates on these schemes are higher compared to bank deposit rates.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while presenting the Union Budget 2026, emphasised the diversified funding strategy. “To finance the fiscal deficit, the net market borrowings from dated securities are estimated at Rs 11.7 lakh crore. The balance financing is expected to come from small savings and other sources. The gross market borrowings are estimated at Rs 17.2 lakh crore,” she said.\n\nExperts have said that the sharply higher than expected gross borrowing of Rs17.2tn is expected to weigh heavily on market sentiments.\n\nThat said, from a market perspective, the composition of the borrowing programme is crucial. With a large part of the gross borrowing allocated towards refinancing, the net supply of government securities to the market remains contained, easing concerns of a sharp spike in yields. Additionally, steady small savings inflows could reduce the pressure on dated securities, especially if divestment plans are executed as budgeted.\n\nOverall, while FY27 borrowing numbers appear large in absolute terms, experts argue that the capex-borrowing gap, rollover-heavy gross borrowing, and reliance on non-market funding sources together suggest a manageable financing outlook.\n\nThe key monitorables going ahead will be the pace of divestment, small savings collections, and adherence to the fiscal consolidation path, all of which will determine how smoothly the government navigates its FY27 funding programme without unsettling financial markets.",

        "full_content": "Capital gainsarise when an investor sells an asset such as shares, mutual funds, bonds or real estate, at a price higher than the purchase cost. While gains can boost returns, tax treatment often decides how much actually lands in the investor’s pocket. Understanding the rules upfront can help avoid unpleasant surprises at the time of filing returns.\n\nTwo types of capital gains: LTCG and STCG\n\nCapital gains are broadly classified into long-term capital gains (LTCG) and short-term capital gains (STCG), depending on how long an asset is held before sale. The holding period varies across asset classes, 12 months for listed equities and equity mutual funds, and 24 months for other assets such as property, unlisted shares and debt instruments. Tax rates differ sharply between the two, making timing critical.\n\nIndexation is a method that adjusts the purchase cost of an asset for inflation, reducing taxable gains. While indexation was earlier available for several asset classes, recent tax changes have significantly curtailed its use.\n\nInterim Budget 2024 removed indexation benefit on property sales.  The indexation benefits apply only to real estate property brought before Jan 23, 2024, while most financial assets no longer enjoy this inflation adjustment.\n\nHow different assets are taxed\n\nFor listed equity shares and equity mutual funds, gains become long-term after 12 months. LTCG is taxed at 12.5 percent beyond the Rs 1.25 lakh annual exemption, while STCG is taxed at 20 percent.\n\nDebt mutual funds purchased after April 1, 2023, are taxed at slab rates regardless of the holding period, reducing their tax efficiency for long-term investors.\n\nListed bonds and debentures attract 12.5 percent tax on long-term gains without indexation, while short-term gains are taxed at slab rates. Unlisted shares qualify as long-term after 24 months and are taxed at 12.5 percent.\n\nFor real estate, property held for over 24 months qualifies as long-term. Properties acquired after July 23, 2024, attract LTCG tax at 12.5 percent without indexation, while short-term gains are taxed as per income slabs.\n\nSet-off provisions for capital losses\n\nThe Income Tax Act provides specific rules for setting off and carrying forward different types of losses.\n\n• STCL can be adjusted against both short-term and long-term capital gains.\n\n• LTCL can only be adjusted against long-term capital gains.\n\n• Non-speculative business losses (like F&O trading) can be set off against any income except salary.\n\n• Speculative losses (like intraday trading) can only be set off against speculative gains.\n\nIf losses remain unadjusted in the current year, they can be carried forward, provided the return is filed on time:\n\n• STCL & LTCL: Can be carried forward for 8 years and set off only against eligible capital gains.\n\n• Non-speculative business losses: Can also be carried forward for 8 years, to be adjusted against any business income, whether speculative or not.\n\n• Speculative business losses: Can be carried forward for 4 years and set off only against speculative business gains.\n\nThese rules help investors and traders plan their taxes efficiently and make informed decisions around asset rebalancing and exit strategies",

The amendment will take effect on April 1, 2026, and will apply to the 2026-27 tax year and subsequent years.\n\nAccording to the Finance Bill 2025, Any capital gains arising by way of redemption of Sovereign Gold Bonds issued by the Reserve Bank of India... shall be exempt from tax if held by an individual until maturity.\n\n\"It is proposed to substitute clause (x) of sub-section (1) of the said section so as to provide that the exemption will be applicable only to those Sovereign Gold Bonds issued by the Reserve Bank of India that are subscribed to by an individual at the time of original issue and are held continuously by such individual until redemption upon maturity, and to provide that this exemption shall apply uniformly to all Sovereign Gold Bonds issued by the Reserve Bank of India,\" per the finance bill, 2025\n\nSGBs are government-backed bonds that allow investors to invest in gold without purchasing physical gold. They are issued by the Reserve Bank of India on behalf of the Government of India, and their value fluctuates with gold prices. In addition to benefiting from any increase in gold prices, investors receive a fixed annual interest rate of 2.5%, paid semi-annually.\n\nThe bonds mature in eight years but offer an early exit option after five years. Since they do not involve physical gold, investors avoid concerns about storage or security, and these bonds can be traded on stock exchanges.\n\nCurrently, if you invest in SGBs and hold them until maturity, you won't have to pay capital gains tax when the bonds are redeemed. These bonds are issued by the RBI in multiple batches over different years. The government now aims to clearly specify who qualifies for this tax exemption to prevent confusion.\n\nUnder the proposed change, the tax exemption will only apply if you purchase the Sovereign Gold Bond at its initial issuance by the RBI (original issue) and hold the bond until it matures.\n\nThis means that if you buy an SGB later from someone else (for instance, from the stock market) and then redeem it at maturity, you might not qualify for the capital gains tax exemption. Only original investors who hold the bond until maturity will receive the tax benefit.",

Key initiatives include support for man-made fibres (MMF), technical textiles, sustainability (Tex-Eco Initiative), skilling (Samarth 2.0) and cluster modernisation. In addition, the government extended export timelines from six months to one year for textile garments, leather products and footwear, providing operational flexibility to exporters.\n\nBudget 2026’s emphasis on end-to-end integration—from fibre to finished goods—aims to narrow India’s competitiveness gap versus peers such as Vietnam and Bangladesh, while improving India’s positioning amid China+1 sourcing diversification. Large-format parks with plug-and-play infrastructure and common testing facilities should compress lead times, lower logistics costs and improve compliance.\n\nWell-capitalised, export-oriented players with scale and compliance readiness are best placed to benefit.Gokaldas Exports,KPR Mill,Pearl Global,Welspun Living,Trident,Vardhman Textiles,SP ApparelandRaymondshould gain from operating leverage, shared infrastructure and diversified export markets. Technical and MMF-focused players are likely to see incremental opportunities. Medium-term margin stability and earnings visibility are expected, supported by policy clarity and potential external catalysts such as an India–EU trade agreement.\n\nSmaller, unorganised manufacturers and cotton-heavy players with limited export exposure may see slower benefits, as gains from the policy framework are likely to accrue gradually and remain execution-dependent at the state and cluster level.\n\nFor more research articles, visit ourMoneycontrol Research page",

        "full_content": "The IT index recovered sharply on February 1, rising up to 4 percent from the day’s low after the Union Budget 2026 proposed changes to the taxation of share buybacks.\n\nNifty IT and consumer durables were the only sectoral indices trading in the green among the 16 major sectors, while the broader market remained under pressure. The benchmark Nifty slipped over 1 percent.\n\nThe rebound in IT shares came after the Finance Minister announced that proceeds from share buybacks would be taxed as capital gains instead of being treated as income. In recent years, IT companies have been among the largest users of buybacks to return cash to shareholders.\n\nShares ofWiprorose as much as 3.6 percent, whileTata Consultancy Servicesadvanced up to 3 percent, emerging as the top gainers in the IT pack.\n\n\"This change is a big positive for Indian IT majors like TCS, Infosys and Wipro because it brings back a tax-efficient way to reward shareholders. These cash-rich companies have long relied on buybacks to return surplus capital,\" Kranthi Bathini, director of equity strategy at WealthMills Securities, said.\n\nThe Nifty IT index was flat in January, while the benchmark Nifty declined 3.1 percent during the same period.\n\n\"At the margin, another positive for investors is the change in buyback taxation, where gains for minority shareholders will now be treated more like capital gains rather than regular income. This addresses a long-standing investor concern and is incrementally market-friendly,\" said N ArunaGiri, CEO of TrustLine Holdings.\n\nUnder the proposal,buyback proceeds will be taxed as capital gainsfor all shareholders, ensuring that tax is levied only on the actual economic gain. The move aligns the taxation of buybacks with that of regular share sales and removes the anomaly faced by non-promoter investors.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "The Union Budget 2026 introduced several growth-oriented measures for the aquaculture industry. With an extensive coastline of over 5,000 km, India ranks as the world’s third-largest fish producer, accounting for approximately 8 percent of global output. The fiscal year 2024-25 saw India cement its global position as seafood exports reached an all-time high of Rs 62,408 crore, with shipments totaling 1.7 million metric tonnes. This trade was largely fueled by robust demand from the United States and China. Frozen shrimp continues to lead the sector's growth, accounting for 70 percent of total export value at over Rs 43,000 crore.\n\nIn a move to bolster the sector, the budget proposed raising the duty-free import limit for specified inputs from 1 percent to 3 percent of the FOB (Free on Board) value of the previous year’s export turnover. Besides this, the government also aims to enhance the fisheries value chain by developing 500 reservoirs and Amrit Sarovars, alongside promoting self-employment in the animal husbandry sector.\n\nDespite a record-breaking FY25, the domestic shrimp industry is under significant stress following the imposition of a 50 percent tariff by the US - India’s top export destination. Although the American market remains unpredictable, the 2026 Union Budget and the recently signed India-EU Free Trade Agreement (January 2026) provide a vital support system. By focusing on cost-competitiveness and European market access, the government is utilizing the India-EU FTA as a strategic hedge to ensure industry resilience amid global geopolitical volatility.\n\nThe government efforts to increase productivity and yields should foster a supportive environment for industry leaders like Avanti Feeds (the country's largest shrimp feed manufacturer) andApex Frozen Foods(an integrated producer and exporter of frozen shrimp).\n\nFor more research articles, visit ourMoneycontrol Research page",

        "full_content": "Nine months after Operation Sindoor fundamentally changed India’s strategic and economic environment and six months after PM Narendra Modi began a new push for economic reforms with a clarion call for ‘swadeshi’ and self-reliance in his Independence Day speech from the Red Fort, his government’s 2026 Budget seeks to carry forward the momentum of several reforms introduced since then with a concerted push to push a ‘Naya Economy.’\n\nThese include a determined focus on what Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman termed as the seven strategic sectors: semiconductors, rare earth, electronic components, biopharma, domestic chemical production, strong capital goods, and boost to textiles.\n\nSpecifically, here are 8 big takeaways from Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s ninth consecutive Budget, which pegs the Indian government’s spending size at about Rs 53 lakh crore (almost Rs 4 lakh crore more than last year) - or roughly about $600 billion:\n\nWhat does the Budget mean for the Economy?\n\nStaying within the blanket: fiscal consolidation: If there has been one consistent theme in PM Modi’s economic doctrine over the past 12 years, it has been a focus on keeping expenses in line with earnings. Holding the line on this underlying impulse, the fiscal deficit has been consolidated to 4.3%, down from 4.3% last year. The debt-GDP ratio has also been reduced to 55.6%, down from 56.1% a year ago. This, by the way, is among the lowest among G7 economies. For comparison, France’s debt-GDP ratio is 94.3%, Italy’s is 132.5%, Japan 200.9%, the UK 100.7%, and US 102.7%. Among major economies, only Germany and Canada have better debt-GDP ratios.\n\nMuscle up with capex push:For several years now, capital spending has been a major driver of India’s economy. By hiking it to Rs 12.22 lakh crore, compared to Rs 11.2 lakh crore last year - this means an 8.9% increase over FY 26 budgeted estimates,  the biggest hike on this measure ever. The government is signalling continuity for its big infrastructure push.\n\nIndia’s logistics costs are generally higher than comparable countries, and the capex push, in tandem with the push for reforms in ports and coastal infrastructure in Parliament’s winter session - through an overhaul of five colonial-era laws that governed this sector - signifies a doubling down on this underlying plumbing for the economy. See, for example, the emphasis on boosting port and rail connectivity through enhanced infrastructure development with a capital outlay of Rs 10,000 crore over the next five years and plans to develop seven high-speed rail corridors as growth connectors, including Mumbai–Pune, Pune–Hyderabad, Hyderabad–Bengaluru, Delhi–Varanasi and Varanasi–Siliguri.\n\nThe fact that gross government borrowings are up to Rs 17 lakh crore without any slippages on the fiscal consolidation roadmaps signals that a large part of this may go into asset creation, rather than current expenses.\n\nTonic for new military-industrial complex:With Operation Sindoor still on and the emergency spending on defence equipment that we have seen in the last few months, defence expenditures were always expected to be up. In line with that, defence capex spending is up by 17% (when we compare revised estimates of last year with Budget estimates for this year). This means a big fillip for the new military-industrial complex that is being set up.\n\nExpect a lot of movement on drones and many smaller companies that will work with the bigger defence firms. Historically, big shifts in the defence industry of any country, usually have a knock-on positive impact on the wider economy. A lot of technologies we take for granted today - like GPS for example - were initially developed for the American military.\n\nWhat does the Budget mean for Businesses?\n\nLong live GCCs:A month after big investments by global tech giants in GCCs, (Google $15 billion bet on Visakhapatnam, Amazon’s $ 35 billion, and Microsoft’s $17.5 billion), the Modi government’s tax holiday for data centres until 2047 signals strategic intent to double down on this and corner global market share. Big tech companies see India as a major testing ground for AI on large population scale, and despite tensions around tariffs, this is emerging as a large growth area, with potential for job creation as well, even as the traditional IT services sector is facing a decline\n\nEasing up for SEZs:Companies manufacturing in special economic zones can now sell surplus products in domestic markets at concessional tariffs. This is a response to the pressure exporters are facing, giving them additional options.\n\nElectronics zindabad:Smartphones and electronics have been one of the big successes of the production-linked incentives plans, which operate in 16 sectors. It makes sense, therefore, for the government to focus on an additional Rs 40,000 crore PLI for electronics.\n\nWhat does the Budget mean for consumers?\n\nNo problem with imports:In a nod to the global Indian, the government has reduced duties on imported goods for personal use by half. Although it is always difficult to define the dividing line between personal and business use.\n\nStudying abroad easier:At a time when the cost of studying abroad has gone up by about 10-15% since last year due to the weakening rupee, there is some relief for those whose kids are studying overseas. TCS for overseas education or medical expenses has been reduced from 5% to 2%. This partly reverses an earlier increase.\n\nIf the 2025 Budget was about boosting the middle classes and consumption spending, and 2024 was about shoring up key political constituencies where the Modi government saw an erosion of support in the 2024 general elections, 2026 is about stabilising in choppy global waters. This is the common thread seeping through strategic areas like semiconductors, critical minerals, battery storage, and defence. Those expecting big bang economic reforms akin to what we saw in 1991, major changes to lift up the animal spirits of the economy, would be disappointed.\n\nAmid a global environment that is hugely challenging and disruptive, the government’s account keepers seem to be saying, ‘Let’s hold the line and be safe. Let’s keep our powder dry.’",

        "full_content": "Banking stocks came under sharp pressure in Sunday’s special Union Budget trading session, dragging the Nifty Bank down by 1.3%. Public sector lenders bore the brunt of the sell-off amid concerns over potential mergers and elevated government borrowing.\n\nAround 2 pm, the Nifty Bank index was down 1.3 percent at 58,832. The weakness was far more pronounced in government-owned banks, with the Nifty PSU Bank index tumbling 3.8 percent, posting the steepest decline among major sectoral indices. In contrast, the Nifty Private Bank index slipped a relatively modest 0.9 percent.\n\nAll 12 constituents of the PSU Bank index were trading in the red. State Bank of India fell 3.6 percent, while Bank of Baroda slid 4.7 percent and Union Bank of India declined 4.2 percent. Punjab National Bank was down 2.2 percent and Canara Bank shed 2 percent, with several other PSU lenders such as Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra and Indian Bank falling between 4 and 6 percent.\n\nLive Updates|Union Budget 2026\n\nPrivate lenders also saw losses, though to a lesser extent. ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Bandhan Bank and IDFC First Bank were down in the range of 1 to 4 percent. AU Small Finance Bank was the lone gainer in the broader banking pack, edging up 0.3 percent.\n\nMarket participants pointed to Budget-linked concerns weighing disproportionately on PSU banks. The government’s announcement of a high-level committee to review the banking sector has revived speculation around consolidation among public sector lenders.\n\n“Historically, bank mergers tend to create a near-term drag on performance,” said Anand Dama, head of BFSI Research at Emkay Global, as cited by Reuters.\n\nIn addition, the government’s plan to borrow a record Rs 17.2 trillion in 2026-27 -- above most market expectations -- has added to the pressure. Higher gross market borrowings could keep bond yields elevated, potentially hurting treasury gains for PSU banks, Dama added.\n\nThe sharp correction comes despite a strong run-up in PSU banking stocks last month. The PSU Bank index had risen 5.7 percent in January, even as the benchmark Nifty 50 fell 3.1 percent, making the segment vulnerable to profit-taking on Budget day.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1 presented Union Budget 2026, opting to maintain the status quo on the taxation of capital gains and income from lotteries and prize winnings.\n\nThe Budget does not propose any changes to existing tax rates, rebate thresholds or exemptions applicable to these income categories, offering continuity to taxpayers amid broader discussions on tax reform.\n\nUnder the current income-tax framework, individuals are required to pay tax on capital gains arising from the transfer of capital assets such as equities, mutual funds, bonds and immovable property. The tax treatment varies based on the holding period and the nature of the asset, with gains classified as either short-term or long-term.\n\nListed equities and equity-oriented mutual funds are taxed differently from debt instruments and real estate, with prescribed rates and exemptions already built into the system. Budget 2026 leaves this structure unchanged.\n\nIncome from lotteries, card games, horse races, crossword puzzles and other prize winnings also remains untouched. Such income is taxed under Section 115BB of the Income Tax Act at a flat rate of 30 percent, along with a 4 percent health and education cess. Crucially, no deductions under Chapter VI-A—such as those for investments, insurance or medical expenses are allowed against this income.\n\nThe basic exemption limit cannot be applied, and taxpayers are also not eligible to claim the Section 87A rebate to reduce tax liability. As a result, these winnings are fully taxable from the first rupee.\n\nBudget 2026 has not modified any of these provisions, meaning the effective tax rate on lottery and similar winnings remains the same as in previous years. Experts say by retaining the current rebate limits and tax treatment for capital gains and prize winnings, Budget 2026 prioritises stability over fresh concessions. While taxpayers may not see additional relief in these areas, the absence of changes removes uncertainty and allows individuals to plan investments and one-off incomes within a familiar and well-established tax framework.",

While presenting the Union Budget, she said the revision window will now remain open until March 31 instead of December 31, subject to payment of a nominal fee, offering relief to those who miss earlier deadlines.\n\n\"I propose to extend the time available for revising returns from 31st December to up to 31st March with the payment of a nominal fee,\" she said in her Budget speech.\n\nWhen a taxpayer finds any omission or incorrect statement in the original Income Tax Return (ITR) filed, it can be corrected by submitting a revised return through the eFiling portal. A Revised Return can be filed at any point before the end of the relevant Assessment Year (AY) or before the assessment is completed, whichever comes first.\n\n\"Taxpayers also get more flexibility to correct mistakes: the time limit to file a revised return has been increased from 9 months to 12 months from the end of the tax year, so even those who file a belated return late will still get a chance to revise it (though a small fee may apply after 9 months),\" said Avnish Arora, Executive Director, Direct Tax, Forvis Mazars in India.\n\nWhat you must know when filing a revised return.\n\nThe income tax return revision is submitted in accordance with section 139(5) of the Income Tax Act.\n\nWhen you file a revised income tax return, it fully replaces the original. After submission, the revised return is regarded as your final income tax return. If your return has been processed and you have received a refund, you can still submit a revised return before the deadline.\n\nIf the ITR form needs to be modified, a revised return can be submitted. However, once the assessing officer completes the assessment under Section 143(3) of the Income-tax Act, filing another revised return is not permitted.\n\nUntil December 31, the income tax department will not impose any penalty or charge for submitting a revised income tax return. If there are errors in the original filing, a revised return will help you to correct them without concern.",

These companies will still be required to serve Indian customers through an Indian reseller entity. The move underscores the government’s intent to strengthen domestic digital infrastructure by attracting foreign investment into India’s cloud ecosystem, while also preserving data sovereignty.\n\nE2E Networks, India’s only listed, homegrown GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) cloud platform,emerges as an indirect beneficiary of this policy shift. While the tax holiday is not directed at domestic cloud providers, the mandate to anchor hyperscale cloud capacity in India and the push for global cloud firms to focus on export-led workloads could enhance E2E’s relative competitiveness in the price-sensitive Indian cloud and AI-compute market.\n\nDespite competition from AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, E2E has consistently competed on performance, customization, and cost efficiency. The increasing adoption of public‑private cloud, hybrid architectures, and multi-cloud strategies further positions E2E as a key enabler in India’s rapidly expanding AI compute environment.\n\nAs global cloud providers expand local data centre operations to take advantage of the tax incentive, E2E, which uses colocation and leased data centre facilities, stands to gain indirectly. The resulting improvements in unit economics (Rs/kW), faster deployment cycles, and deeper integration with India’s AI-data centre ecosystem could enhance E2E’s operating leverage and credibility.\n\nAdditionally, India’s rising sovereign AI compute requirements, the accelerating enterprise AI adoption, and stricter data-localisation norms - especially under the India AI Mission - are amplifying demand for domestic cloud infrastructure providers.\n\nWhile competitive intensity from global hyperscalers may increase and exert pricing pressure, India’s AI/ML workload expansion remains robust. The policy announcement improves India’s attractiveness as a cloud base, boosts customer confidence in local compute availability, and could strengthen positive sentiment around domestic players like E2E Networks.",

        "full_content": "The Budget 2026-reaffirmed the government’s infrastructure-led growth strategy, with a sharper focus on scaling public capital expenditure, crowding in private investment and expanding opportunity across transport, urban development, energy and heavy manufacturing.\n\nPresenting her ninth successive Budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed to raise the capital expenditure to Rs 12.2 lakh crore in FY27, up from Rs 11.2 lakh crore in FY26, extending a decade-long expansion in public investment that has seen capex rise more than six-fold since FY15.\n\nThe continued increase comes even as the government adheres to a tighter fiscal path, with the deficit targeted at 4.3 percent of the GDP, underlining the primacy accorded to growth-supportive spending.\n\nA notable shift in this year’s budget is the emphasis on risk mitigation and financing depth for infrastructure projects.\n\nTo strengthen lender and developer confidence during the construction phase, the government announced an Infrastructure Risk Guarantee Fund, which will provide calibrated partial credit guarantees to lenders. The move is expected to reduce project risk premiums and lower borrowing costs for private developers, particularly in large transport, urban and logistics projects.\n\nThe Budget also placed renewed emphasis on transport infrastructure.\n\nProposals include new dedicated freight corridors linking eastern and western industrial belts, operationalisation of 20 new national waterways over five years and incentives to shift cargo movement towards coastal shipping and inland waterways. These measures directly benefit sectors such as ports, logistics, shipbuilding, inland vessel manufacturing, cement and steel, while also lowering economy-wide logistics costs over time.\n\nDedicated freight corridors that will link eastern mineral belts to western consumption and port hubs is expected to unlock fresh EPC opportunities across track-laying, signalling, rolling stock, electrification and station redevelopment.\n\nFor capital goods manufacturers, this translates into sustained demand for locomotives, wagons, signalling systems, power equipment and automation technologies over a multi-year execution horizon.\n\nThe proposal to develop seven high-speed rail corridors as “growth connectors” further deepens visibility for large-ticket civil works, tunnelling, viaduct construction and specialised rail equipment. These projects typically involve long gestation periods and high capital intensity, favouring well-capitalised EPC players and global technology partnerships, while also creating downstream demand for cement, steel, construction chemicals and precision engineering firms.\n\nUrban infrastructure emerged as another key beneficiary. The government reiterated its focus on tier 2 and 3 cities, positioning them as new growth centres. A structured push towards City Economic Regions will be backed by challenge-mode financing, with Rs 5,000 crore per region over five years proposed to fund infrastructure aligned to local economic strengths.\n\nComplementing this, incentives for large municipal bond issuances aim to deepen urban financing markets and reduce dependence on budgetary support.\n\nEnergy and industrial infrastructure also received targeted support. The Budget announced a Rs 20,000 crore outlay over five years for scaling up carbon capture, utilisation and storage technologies across power, steel, cement and refining sectors, signalling future capex opportunities in clean energy and decarbonisation-linked equipment.\n\nThe Budget’s dedicated scheme for enhancing construction and infrastructure equipment manufacturing strengthens domestic capacity in areas ranging from tunnel-boring machines and metro construction equipment to high-altitude road-building and fire-safety systems.\n\nBy linking infrastructure expansion with localised equipment manufacturing, the government is attempting to reduce import dependence while creating a virtuous cycle between project execution and industrial growth, thereby improving earnings visibility for both capital goods makers and EPC contractors alike.\n\nBeyond headline allocations, the Budget also attempted to strengthen the financial plumbing required to sustain a long infrastructure cycle.\n\nMeasures to deepen the corporate bond market, including the introduction of a market-making framework and total return swaps on corporate bonds, are expected to improve liquidity and price discovery for long-term infrastructure paper.\n\nThis, along with incentives for large municipal bond issuances, could gradually lower the cost of capital for urban infrastructure projects and reduce reliance on bank financing.",

        "full_content": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while presenting the Union Budget on February 1, 2026, keeps the income tax structure unchanged, opting for continuity rather than fresh relief. There are no revisions to income tax slabs under either the old or the new tax regime, no changes to standard deduction limits, and no new exemptions or rebates announced.\n\nThe income-tax slabs relevant for Assessment Year 2026-27 remain the same as those announced in Union Budget 2025.\n\nAs per Kiran Gandhi, Pune-based financial mentor, “In Budget 2026, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman kept the standard deduction unchanged for FY 2026–27, offering stability but no new relief for salaried employees and pensioners. The deduction remains Rs 50,000 in the old regime and Rs 75,000 in the new regime, with existing slabs and exemptions continuing as before.”\n\nHowever, while rates stay steady, compliance rules tighten further. According to Kiran Gandhi, Pune-based financial mentor, “misreporting of income now attracts a 100 per cent tax penalty, penalties for non-disclosure expand, NRIs face TDS on property sales, and small taxpayers get a six-month window to disclose foreign assets.”\n\nFor senior citizens, the union budget 2026 offers stability but little relief. Lt Col Rochak Bakshi, CFP and MD, Trunor Enterprises, notes that “Budget 2026 brings no higher exemptions or new healthcare deductions, retaining old-regime limits of Rs 3 lakh for those aged 60-79 and Rs 5 lakh for those above 80.” Long-standing demands such as expanded Section 80DDB medical relief, in-home care deductions, and higher pensions remain unmet, even as costs rise.\n\nThe Finance Minister also refrains from introducing fresh tax incentives to encourage household shifts toward debt or equity markets, despite the Economic Survey highlighting a steady move away from bank deposits.\n\nWith no headline changes, the key question for taxpayers remains unchanged: which tax regime makes more sense for your income and deductions?\n\nBelow are illustrative case studies comparing tax outgo under both regimes, based on Budget 2026 proposals. Pick the one closest to your annual income to understand how your taxes shape up now.\n\nSalaried professional | Annual income: Rs 13 lakh\n\nAt this income, the contrast between the two regimes is already stark. Even after claiming Rs 2.5 lakh in deductions under the old regime, tax outgo stands at over Rs 1 lakh, while the new regime brings it down to zero.\n\nTakeaway:At Rs 13 lakh, the new tax regime already results in nil tax liability. Budget 2026 status quo keeps this advantage intact.\n\nSingle parent | Annual income: Rs 15 lakh\n\nWith Rs 2.5 lakh in deductions, the old regime still leaves a tax bill of nearly Rs 1.8 lakh. The new regime, despite no deductions, cuts the outgo to under Rs 1 lakh.\n\nTakeaway:At Rs 15 lakh, lower slab rates under the new regime outweigh the benefit of deductions available in the old regime.\n\nRetired Navy officer | Annual income: Rs 25 lakh\n\nPension income offers stability, but deductions are limited. Even after claiming available exemptions, tax under the old regime is close to Rs 5 lakh, compared to about Rs 3.2 lakh under the new regime.\n\nTakeaway:For pensioners with fewer deductions, the new regime already delivers materially lower tax outgo.\n\nTech influencer | Annual income: Rs 35 lakh\n\nDespite claiming deductions under the old regime, tax liability remains above Rs 8 lakh. Under the new regime, higher taxable income is offset by lower slab rates, reducing tax by over Rs 1.6 lakh.\n\nTakeaway:At Rs 35 lakh, lower slab rates under the new regime compensate for the absence of deductions on business income.\n\nDoctor | Annual income: Rs 65 lakh\n\nAt higher incomes, deductions shrink in impact. Even after exemptions, tax under the old regime exceeds Rs 18 lakh, while the new regime lowers it by over Rs 1.7 lakh.\n\nTakeaway:For high-income professionals, absolute savings under the new regime exist, but overall tax burden remains heavy.\n\nStartup founder | Annual income: Rs 1.5 crore\n\nDespite deductions under the old regime, tax liability crosses Rs 50 lakh. The new regime trims this by nearly Rs 1.9 lakh, driven purely by slab structure.\n\nTakeaway:At very high incomes, the difference between regimes narrows; marginal rates and surcharges matter more than deductions.",

Importers will continue to pay the same duty rates as before.\n\nCurrently, import of gold in all forms attracts a 6 percent duty, including 5 percent basic customs duty (BCD) and 1 percent agriculture infrastructure and development cess (AIDC).\n\nSilver imports are taxed at 6 percent for eligible Indian residents, while others pay 36 percent, comprising 35 percent basic customs duty and 1 percent AIDC. Both metals attract a uniform GST of 3 percent.\n\nThe Centre had slashed the customs duty on gold from 15 percent to 6 percent with effect from July 24, 2024.\n\nAlthough there was some confusion earlier when the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that “the tariff rate on all dutiable goods imported for personal use would be reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent,” market experts have clarified that it will not include the import of gold and silver jewellery, or any other precious metals.\n\nGoods for personal use generally include items such as clothing, footwear, personal electronics, gadgets, watches, accessories, household items, and certain medicines imported in reasonable quantities and not intended for commercial resale, often assessed under the personal effects or baggage provisions of customs law.\n\n“There was no update on import duty for bullion in the Budget 2026. With sharp weakness already seen in CME on Friday, domestic gold and silver reacted negatively,” said Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities.\n\nGold has corrected nearly 20 percent from its peak of Rs 1,82,500 to around Rs 1,47,800, while silver has seen a much sharper 36 percent decline from Rs 4,20,000 to near Rs 2,65,650.",

        "full_content": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s ninth consecutive budget tinkered with the social sector spends which includes the ministry of rural development, health, education and social welfare and a slew of schemes.\n\nAllocation for Rural development saw a modest increase from Rs2.6 lakh cr to Rs2.73 lakh cr in FY 2026-27 (Budget Estimates). Health  ministry’s allocation went up from Rs98311 cr (BE- 2025-26) to Rs 1.04 lakh cr for FY 27. Revised estimates – the actual spending by the ministry was at Rs94,625 cr.\n\nThe Education ministry also saw a marginal uptick in its allocation from Rs1.28 lakh cr (FY 2025-26) to Rs1.39 lakh cr ( Budget estimates in FY 2026-27).\n\n“ Our third kartavya, aligned with our vision of Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, is to ensure that every family, community, region and sector has access to resources, amenities and opportunities for meaningful participation,” the finance minister said.\n\nModi government’s social sector strategy over the last five years has seen a shift from a relief model to  a more tech-driven model focused on asset creation  and overall human development. Pandemic response budgets were largely focused on providing free food grains -  with the key focus being on survival. There were massive allocations  for PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana  and MGNREGA for generating rural employment. From 2023, there has been a shift in strategy towards assets creation – with emphasis on Jal Jeevan Mission  (piped water  to over 15 crore households by 2026); PM Awas Yojana (housing for all).\n\nIn 2026, the government replaced schemes like MGNREGA with VB-GRAM (Viksit Bharat Gramin)- which links rural employment to durable infrastructure like water  conservation and irrigation projects. VB-GRAM was allocated Rs95,692 Cr in FY 27.\n\nThere has been also a shift  towards expanding state facilities for specialized  care , Budget 2025-26 mandated setting up Day Care Cancer Centres in all district hospitals , adding 75,000 medical seats over five years. Ayushman Bharat was expanded to include senior citizens and gig workers.   Budget 2026-27 emphasizes on building a strong ‘care ecosystem’ – covering geriatric and allied care services. Under which 1.5 lakh care givers will be trained.\n\nOverall government expenditure on social services rose to7.9  per  cent of GDP  in FY 2026. Critics say that housing and  water sanitation allocations have been steady, while  share of education and traditional  rural development ( as a per cent of total expenditure) has stagnated  or declined from pandemic peaks. The ILO has reported that India’s  social security coverage has nearly doubled from 24.4% in 2021 to 48.8% in 2024\n\nSocial sector expenditure as a percentage of total union government spending reached an all time low of 17% in 2024-25 before a recovery to19% in 2025-26.",

Better risk allocation is what will bring private capital back at scale,” said, Krunal Sheth, Partner, NPV Valuation Services LLP.\n\nIndustry experts said the initiative could particularly benefit real estate developers involved in large housing, mixed-use and urban infrastructure projects, where financing often becomes difficult due to cautious lending by banks and non-bank financiers.\n\nNikhil Hawelia, Secretary, CREDAI (Western UP & NCR) and MD, Hawelia Group, said that the Infrastructure Risk Guarantee Fund acts as a safety net for the banks.\n\n\"This announcement will have a significant impact for the sectors, risk mitigation and liquidity shall be addressed at the same time. The mid-sized developers would get the opportunity for large-scale projects which will truly address the needs of legacy stalled and frozen assets,\" he said.\n\nThe proposed Infrastructure Risk Guarantee Fund adds to the government’s broader efforts to revive private investment, ease financing constraints and accelerate project delivery across the real estate and construction ecosystem, experts said.\n\n“The introduction of the Infrastructure Risk Guarantee Fund reflects a mature policy approach that recognises execution risk as a core constraint to quality development. Together, these measures position real estate as a long-term enabler of economic continuity, urban depth, and sustainable value creation across markets,” Vishal Raheja, Founder & MD, InvestoXpert Advisors said.\n\nExperts added that the measure is also expected to aid the revival of public-private partnership (PPP) projects and support faster execution under the National Infrastructure Pipeline, while helping construction companies secure timely funding and maintain cash flows.",

The move offers continuity for investors and businesses at a time of global uncertainty, signalling the government’s intent to avoid fresh tax shocks. Market participants had been watching closely for any tweaks, but the status quo prevailed.\n\nCapital gains tax in India is levied on profits from the sale of capital assets, such as property, shares, or mutual fund investments. This profit is taxed in the financial year in which the capital asset is sold.\n\nCapital gains are classified as short-term or long-term, depending on the period the asset is held before sale. Gain from the sale of an asset is considered Short-term if it is owned for up to 24 months before sale. If an asset is sold after 24 months of ownership, then it is considered long-term.\n\nFor assets such as listed equity shares, equity-oriented mutual funds, etc., if held for up to 12 months before sale, the income from their sale is treated as long-term.\n\nFor FY 2025–26, India’s capital gains tax regime has been simplified and rationalised with new tax rates and holding-period norms applying from July 23, 2024. Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) on most assets—including listed shares, equity-oriented mutual funds, real estate and other capital assets—are taxed at a flat 12.5% without indexation, replacing the earlier varied rates.\n\nUnder Section 112A, the annual exemption for LTCG on listed equity and equity-linked units has increased to ₹1.25 lakh; gains above that are taxed at 12.5%. Tax on LTCG from the sale of any asset is 12.5%.\n\n\"If LTCG are from the sale of listed equity shares, equity-oriented mutual funds, etc, then an exemption of ₹1.25 lakh is provided. These taxes are increased by Surcharge, if applicable and Education Cess of 4%,\" said Mihir Tanna, Associate Director of Direct Tax at SK Patodia & Associate LLP.\n\nTax on Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG)is 20% in case of sale of assets like listed equity shares, equity-oriented mutual funds, etc. Tax on Short-term capital gains from the sale of any other asset is levied at the regular rate of income tax.\n\nSudhir Kaushik, Co-founder & CEO, Taxspanner (a Zaggle company) said, \"STCG on listed equity and equity funds (with STT paid) are now taxed at 20% under Section 111A, while STCG on other assets is added to your total income and taxed at your normal slab rate.\"\n\n\"Indexation benefits have been largely removed for most assets, further simplifying calculations and bringing greater uniformity across capital gains taxation for the year,\" said Kaushik.",

Over the past decade, the defence Budget has nearly doubled, reflecting a steady push towards modernisation, indigenisation and higher operational readiness.\n\nA key shift this year is the sharper focus on capital expenditure. The government has earmarked Rs 2.2 lakh crore on capex in the sector, up from Rs 1.8 lakh crore budgeted for FY26. This takes the share of capital spending to around 28 percent from 26.4 percent of the total defence Budget (including pensions and civil defence spending).\n\nThe long-term trend shows a clear structural change. Defence capital outlay has more than doubled from Rs 86,357 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 2.2 lakh crore in FY27, even as total defence spending rose from Rs 3.52 lakh crore to over Rs 7.8 lakh crore over the same period.\n\nThe increase in capex has been driven by higher allocations for aircraft, naval platforms, missiles, artillery and other high-value equipment, alongside a push for domestic procurement under the government’s indigenisation agenda.\n\nThe post-Operation Sindoor Budget also aligns with the broader strategic shift seen in recent years, where India has prioritised spending on force modernisation, air defence systems and next-generation platforms.",

Last year, SEBI warned that nearly 9 out of 10 options traders lose money. The Budget announcement follows repeated cautions over an “unchecked explosion” in retail F&O activity and a series of regulatory actions by SEBI.\n\nWho will be impacted the most?\n\nThe government’s hike in STT on F&O is set to hurt derivatives turnover by making F&O less attractive for retail traders. This will directly dent trading volumes and profitability for exchanges.BSE,which has rapidly gained F&O market share since April 2023, is vulnerable to volume-led earnings hit, whileNSEtoo faces near-term negatives as it prepares for its IPO even though it has a very big presence in cash equity market segment which will not be impacted by the Budget. Investors should note that SEBI has been contemplating to potentially scrap weekly options which could be another blow for exchanges.\n\nThe impact will be more severe for brokers—particularly discount brokers that are heavily dependent on retail derivatives activity. After regulatory tightening in past 18 months, the latest Budget adds another layer of policy overhang, intensifying concerns for the broking industry.\n\nWith discount brokers now commanding 76–78% of active NSE clients in FY25 (up from ~40% in FY20 and under 10% in FY15), this segment stands to lose the most from the Budget measures.

It involves more than monthly payments; it concerns long-term security, flexibility, and peace of mind. With house prices remaining high in many areas and rents continuing to increase, the decision has become even more challenging. Understanding the key advantages and disadvantages of each option can help individuals choose the path that best fits their finances, lifestyle, and future goals.\n\nPros and cons of buying a home\n\nWhen you consider buying a home, you might see many benefits. For example, you own the property, it is completely yours, and the home is an asset. Over time, the value of the home may increase, helping you build wealth. With fixed equated monthly instalments (EMIs), your payments stay the same, unlike rent, which can go up each year.\n\nYou are free to renovate, decorate, or extend the home as you wish. There’s no need to worry about being asked to leave if the landlord sells.\n\n\"Buying a home helps create a long-term asset. It can offer price appreciation, predictable EMIs, and tax benefits on homeloans.For many Indian families, it also brings emotional comfort and a sense of stability,\" said Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.com \"But these benefits come with costs. Upfront expenses are high. Maintenance is ongoing. Property is also illiquid. In the early years, this can strain cash flows. A home loan also ties households down at a time when careers, incomes, and cities may still be changing,\" added Shetty.\n\nWhile a home comes with high upfront costs, it requires you to make large deposits for registration and stamp duty, in addition to the cost of the home. Overall, moving costs can also be expensive. Owning a home also comes with responsibility. You need to maintain it and repair it every now and then.\n\nWhile there is no doubt that having a home creates a long-term asset, you can only benefit from it when you have a second home to live in. Also, selling a home takes time, which makes moving harder. Moreover, a loan can last 20–30 years or more. Until and unless you pay up your EMIs, technically, your home belongs to your bank, not you.\n\nPros and cons of renting a home\n\nRenting a home comes with lower upfront costs. Usually just a deposit and a few months’ rent. It is easier to move for work, family, or lifestyle changes. Repairs and major maintenance are usually handled by the landlord. Also, there is no property market risk. You are not affected if house prices fall.\n\n\"Renting works differently. It keeps monthly costs lower and allows flexibility. Renters can live closer to work, move cities easily, and invest surplus savings in financial assets. Over time, these investments can grow steadily. This approach often suits the early earning years. The downsides are clear. There is no ownership. Rents usually rise. Housing security depends on the landlord,\" added Shetty.\n\nYou must understand that monthly rent does not create an asset. Whether your salary increases or not, rent can go up when contracts are renewed after 11 months. In Delhi NCR, it usually rises by 10 per cent.\n\nFurthermore, many restrictions exist when decorating your rented home. Some landlords might not permit keeping pets. In fact, landlords may choose not to renew a lease or may sell the property even after your contract does not end. Over time, renting can cost more than buying without providing any return.\n\nThe choice between renting and buying should be driven by financial readiness, not social pressure. Renting early while investing regularly builds financial strength. Buying makes sense only when income is stable, location plans are clear, and the EMI fits comfortably within the household budget. \"A home should support long-term wealth, not control it,\" said Shetty.",

        "full_content": "Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has pegged India’s nominal growth at 10 percent for FY27, lower than 10.1 percent in the previous fiscal.\n\nWhile for the current fiscal, India’s economy is estimated to have rebounded sharply, with the real GDP growing 7.4 percent compared with 6.5 percent in the previous fiscal year, according to data released by the government on January 7. The pickup marks a return to stronger momentum after a year of moderation and comes just weeks before a major methodological reset in national accounts.\n\nIn FY26, India’s economy is likely to grow 7.4 percent, as per statistics ministry’s first advance estimate.\n\nIndia’s economy extended its strong run, growing at a six-quarter high of 8.2 percent in July–September (Q2FY26), helped by robust manufacturing and a buoyant services sector, especially financial, real estate and professional services.\n\nThe year 2026 is likely to continue the momentum seen in economic growth in 2025, as the impact of US' tariffs on India’s economy has been much lower than what was anticipated earlier, S Mahendra Dev, Chairman, Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister had said. High domestic consumption, and continued thrust on public capital expenditure is likely to keep growth around 6.5-7 percent in the next fiscal year (FY27), Mahendra Dev had said, adding that 2026 could also see more FDI and FPI inflows, which should prompt the rupee to appreciate.\n\nThe government’s decision to deliver income tax relief and rationalise GST rates during FY26 played a central role in shoring up consumption demand, even as external conditions remained challenging. Export prospects were weighed down by global trade uncertainty and tariffs, but domestic demand helped offset those headwinds.\n\nMonetary policy was also expected to provide a strong tailwind. The Reserve Bank of India cut policy rates by a cumulative 125 basis points from 6.5 percent over the year, easing borrowing costs for households and businesses.\n\nQuarterly data release for the first half of the year saw the economy grow at 8 percent, beating market estimates. The Indian economy grew 8.2 percent in the second quarter – its fastest pace in six quarters.\n\nThe FY26 estimates assume added significance as they represent the final release under the existing GDP series with a 2011–12 base year. The next set of advance estimates, using a revised 2022–23 base, is scheduled for release on February 27. The transition is expected to incorporate newer data sources and updated methodologies, potentially altering growth dynamics for recent years.",

        "full_content": "The Union Budget 2026–27 unveiled a broad rationalisation of customs duties, with the government moving to withdraw long-standing exemptions, simplify tariff structures and recalibrate import duties across a wide range of sectors to support domestic manufacturing and reduce cost disadvantages for Indian producers.\n\nAnnouncing the measures in her Budget speech on February 1, Nirmala Sitharaman said the government has removed customs duty exemptions on items already being manufactured domestically or where imports were negligible. “To continue weeding out long continuing customs duty exemptions, I propose to remove certain exemptions on items which are being manufactured in India or where the imports are negligible,” she said. She also proposed incorporating certain effective duty rates from customs notifications directly into the tariff schedule “to further simplify the process of ascertaining the rate of duty applicable on a particular item”.\n\nAs part of sector-specific proposals, the finance minister announced a set of measures aimed at boosting exports in marine, leather and textile segments. The limit for duty-free imports of specified inputs used for processing seafood products for export will be increased from the current 1 percent to 3 percent of the free on board value of the previous year’s export turnover.\n\nIn another relief for the leather sector, duty-free imports of specified inputs – currently available for exports of leather or synthetic footwear – will now be extended to exports of shoe uppers as well. Exporters of leather or textile garments, leather or synthetic footwear and other leather products will also get more time to ship final products, with the export period being extended from six months to one year.\n\nEnergy transition and critical inputs\n\nIn a move aligned with India’s energy transition goals, the Budget extends the existing basic customs duty exemption on capital goods used for manufacturing lithium-ion cells for batteries to cover those used for manufacturing lithium-ion cells for battery energy storage systems as well. The government also proposed to exempt basic customs duty on imports of sodium antimonate used in the manufacture of solar glass.\n\nCustoms relief was also announced for critical minerals, with the government proposing a basic customs duty exemption on the import of capital goods required for processing critical minerals in India, a step aimed at strengthening domestic value chains in strategically important materials.\n\nFor the nuclear power sector, the finance minister said the existing basic customs duty exemption on imports of goods required for nuclear power projects would be extended till 2035 and expanded to cover all nuclear plants irrespective of capacity.\n\nIn the clean fuels space, Sitharaman announced that the entire value of biogas will be excluded while calculating the central excise duty payable on biogas-blended compressed natural gas, a measure expected to improve the commercial viability of blended fuel offerings.\n\nAviation and electronics manufacturing\n\nCustoms duty exemptions were also announced for the aviation sector. The Budget proposes to exempt basic customs duty on components and parts required for the manufacture of civilian, training and other aircraft. In addition, raw materials imported for manufacturing aircraft parts used in maintenance, repair and overhaul activities by units in the defence sector will also be exempted from basic customs duty.\n\nTo deepen value addition in consumer electronics, the finance minister proposed exempting basic customs duty on specified parts used in the manufacture of microwave ovens, continuing the government’s focus on local manufacturing under the electronics production ecosystem.\n\nTogether, the measures mark a continued shift towards rationalised tariffs, targeted exemptions and policy support aimed at strengthening domestic manufacturing while supporting exports and strategic sectors.",

        "full_content": "Budget 2026 may not have delivered headline-grabbing tax sops, but taken in totality, it stands out as a taxpayer-friendly budget built on continuity, certainty and simplicity. For individual taxpayers, that itself is a relief.\n\nIn a welcome move Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed to implement the New Tax Act, 2025 from April 1, 2026, which marks a structural shift from the long-standing Income Tax Act, 1961, with the objective of simplifying tax law and improving clarity for taxpayers.\n\nThe Income Tax Act, 2025 is a comprehensive law that lays down the framework for the levy, administration, collection and recovery of direct taxes in India. Spread across more than 600 pages, it comprises 536 sections, 23 chapters and 16 schedules, covering virtually every aspect of taxation.\n\nIn a further reform-oriented step, the government has lowered the TCS rate on overseas remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme for education and medical expenses from 5 percent to 2 percent. This move comes as a meaningful relief for families facing sharply rising costs of studying or seeking treatment abroad. By reducing upfront cash outgo for essential expenses, the change improves short-term liquidity while maintaining oversight of cross-border transactions striking a balance between taxpayer relief and regulatory discipline.\n\nFollowing the governnment focus on voluntary disclosures, the proposal is made to give leeway to people who have recently relocated like students, young professionals and salaried employees and may have made genuine mistakes of undisclosing income due to lack of awareness.\n\nA one-time compliance window of six months is a welcome move to help such taxpayers.  Undisclosed income could be taxed at 30 per cent but without prosecution. The focus is on encouraging voluntary compliance rather than criminal action.\n\nNew Tax Regime Remains Preferred Choice\n\nOver the last few years, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has steadily reshaped India’s personal tax framework moving away from a maze of exemptions to a system anchored in lower rates, fewer conditions and predictable outcomes. Budget 2026 stays firmly on that path.\n\nThe biggest win for taxpayers has come not in one dramatic announcement, but through incremental changes across recent budgets. The expansion and strengthening of the new tax regime, wider slabs, lower effective rates and a sharply higher rebate threshold have together ensured that a large section of middle-class taxpayers now pay either significantly lower tax or no tax at all. Add to that the higher standard deduction under the new regime, and the math has decisively tilted in favour of simplicity.\n\nMoreover, the new tax regime follows a more restrained approach, with surcharge capped at 25 percent for incomes above Rs 2 crore, regardless of age. Under the old tax regime, surcharge rates rise steeply with incomen. It is 10 percent for incomes between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 1 crore, 15 percent between Rs 1 crore and Rs 2 crore, 25 percent between Rs 2 crore and Rs 5 crore, and 37 percent for incomes above Rs 5 crore.\n\nAs a result, taxpayers in the highest bracket under the new regime face an effective tax rate of 39 percent while it is over 42 percent in the old regime.  This makes the new tax regime relatively more attractive for high-income earners.\n\nSurcharge is an additional tax levied on high-income taxpayers over and above the basic income tax, and it plays a significant role in determining the effective tax rate.\n\nWhat Budget 2026 does particularly well is avoid policy whiplash. After major overhauls to capital gains taxation and slab rationalisation in earlier budgets, this year’s focus on stability sends a clear signal: taxpayers can plan without fear of frequent rule changes. That predictability matters just as much as tax relief.\n\nImportantly, the old tax regime has not been dismantled. Those with homeloans,HRA benefits and long-term savings commitments still have the option to optimise taxes through deductions. At the same time, first-time earners, professionals and those without complex financial lives can opt for a clean, no-frills tax system.\n\nFor AY 2024–25, out of 7.28 crore ITRs filed till July 31, 2024, around 5.27 crore were under the new tax regime, while 2.01 crore remained under the old regime - accounting for roughly 72 percent and 28 percent respectively.\n\nOver decades, the Indian tax system has encouraged household savings through tax-linked instruments like provident funds, insurance, and housing. A sudden withdrawal of the old regime could disrupt long-term financial planning for millions who have committed to these products based on stable tax assumptions.\n\nFor now, the debate is less about whether the old regime will be scrapped and more about how long it will coexist alongside the new one.\n\nBudget 2026 is expected to reinforce the government’s preference for simplicity and compliance, but without pulling the plug on a system that still works for nearly a third of taxpayers. For individuals, the message remains unchanged: evaluate both regimes carefully, because choice, at least for now, seems here to stay.",

        "full_content": "Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday announced a six-month foreign asset disclosure scheme for taxpayers, saying the move is aimed at encouraging voluntary compliance and giving relief to individuals who failed to report overseas assets due to genuine oversight.\n\nPresenting the Union Budget in the Lok Sabha on February 1, she said the window would allow taxpayers to come forward, declare undisclosed foreign assets and regularise their tax position without facing prosecution.\n\nThe FM said, \"This proposal is made with respect for small taxpayers, especially students, young professionals, salaried employees and individuals who have recently relocated. Many of them may have made genuine mistakes due to a lack of awareness. I suggest a one-time compliance window of six months, supported by a clear disclosure scheme, to help such taxpayers regularise their position and follow the law.\"\n\nSonam Srivastava, Founder and Fund Manager at Wright Research PMS, said, \"This is a pragmatic clean-up move rather than a revenue grab. A time-bound six-month foreign asset disclosure window signals that the government wants better compliance and data visibility before tightening enforcement.\"\n\nFor taxpayers, especially those with legacy overseas holdings, ESOPs, inherited assets, or small foreign accounts, this lowers the cost of coming clean without immediate punitive action. From a markets perspective, the signal matters more than the collections. It reduces uncertainty around retrospective scrutiny and aligns India with global information-sharing regimes, which improves credibility with foreign investors.\n\nThe government has introduced a six-month disclosure scheme for taxpayers with undisclosed foreign income or assets. The scheme covers two categories:\n\nCategory A: Previously non-disclosing taxpayers\n\n\"These are taxpayers who failed to disclose any foreign income or assets. Those with undisclosed foreign assets or income up to 1 crore rupees are eligible to participate. They must pay: 30% of the asset's fair market value or undisclosed income as tax. An additional 30% as a penalty substitute in return, they receive immunity from prosecution,\" said Tanvi Kanchan, Associate Director & Head - NRI Business, Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers Limited.\n\nThe FM said that the focus should be on encouraging voluntary compliance rather than criminal action. There should be no interest liability for the period covered by the scheme, and penalties should be waived for first-time or technical defaults.\n\nCategory B: Partially compliant taxpayers\n\nThese are taxpayers who disclosed some foreign income and paid taxes on it, but failed to declare certain acquired assets. Those with assets valued up to 5 crore rupees can participate. They need only pay a one-time fee of 1 lakh rupees and will receive immunity from penalties and prosecution. \"This scheme provides a window for taxpayers to regularize their foreign financial positions with reduced penalties in exchange for full disclosure,\" said Rathi.\n\n\"The real test will be what follows the window. If enforcement becomes sharper and automated after six months, compliance behaviour will structurally change. If not, disclosures risk being one-off housekeeping rather than a durable shift,\" added Srivastava.",

        "full_content": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1, as a part of the Union Budget 2026, the government has proposed that any interest awarded by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) to a natural person will be fully exempt from income tax.\n\nThis directly responds to long-standing criticism that this interest, paid because of delayed justice, shouldn’t be taxed like ordinary income.\n\nThe core argument behind this is that this interest is not income in the real sense.\n\nIt is not earned through investment, labour, or business activity. It is compensation linked to loss, injury, disability, or death, and exists only because justice in such cases is often delayed.\n\n\"This intent carries forward into the Budget’s broader focus on strengthening the financial sector and positioning AI as a growth multiplier, signalling a move towards a more transparent, efficient, and consumer-protective ecosystem. For customer-backed, AI-led insurtechs like CoverSure, this creates the right environment to simplify claims, reduce friction, and restore trust in insurance as a true safety net,\" said Saurabh Vijayvergia, Founder & CEO, CoverSure.\n\nAt present, this interest is treated like regular taxable income.\n\nAs a result, banks and financial institutions deduct TDS automatically, forcing accident victims and bereaved families to deal with reduced compensation, refund processes, and tax compliance at a time of emotional and financial distress.",

This proposal not only improves liquidity for genuine personal needs but also reflects a more taxpayer-friendly approach without diluting the objective of monitoring cross-border fund flows,” said Kunal Savani, Partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.\n\nMeanwhile, TCS for educationloanopted from financial institutions continues to be pegged at zero percent. Industry analysts believe that completely removing TCS on self-funded remittances for overseas education would have delivered far deeper relief.\n\n\"While the rationalisation of TCS is a step in the right direction, completely removing TCS on education loan borrowings would have delivered far deeper relief to students who finance their overseas education through debt,\" said Pavan Kavad, Managing Director of Prithvi Exchange.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data show that education-related outward remittances have eased in November after a spike in September 2025. The remittances from India for overseas education under the LRS fell to $120.94 million in November 2025, down 25.92 percent from October and 54.25 percent in September 2025.

        "full_content": "Budget 2026 has offered continuity on one of the most closely watched tax provisions. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman maintained the Section 80C investment limit unchanged at Rs 1.5 lakh a year, extending a status quo that has been in place for several years.\n\nFinanace Minister announced that Budget 2026 will come into effect from April 2026.\n\n“I announced a comprehensive review of the Income Tax Act, 1961 in July 2024. This has been completed in record time. The Income Tax Act, 2025 will come into effect from April 1, 2026… simplified rules & forms will be notified shortly.”\n\nSection 80C allows taxpayers to reduce taxable income through investments and expenses such as provident fund contributions, insurance premiums, ELSS, PPF, NSC, tuition fees and home loan principal repayments. With the cap unchanged, there is no additional scope for taxpayers to increase deductions, even as household expenses and long-term financial commitments continue to rise.\n\nFor many salaried individuals, the existing limit is already exhausted through mandatory provident fund contributions and insurance payments, leaving little flexibility to invest more for tax purposes. This had fuelled expectations of a higher ceiling in Budget 2026, particularly from middle-income earners facing higher costs of living.\n\nThe decision also reinforces the government’s broader push towards the new tax regime, where deductions like Section 80C are not available but slab rates are lower. Taxpayers choosing the new regime will continue to benefit from simpler compliance, while those relying on deductions will need to stick with the old structure.\n\nThe old tax regime remains relevant mainly for individuals with sizeable deductions linked to housingloans,insurance and long-term savings. For others, the absence of any enhancement in Section 80C reduces the incentive to plan fresh investments purely for tax savings.\n\nAs in previous years, taxpayers will need to carefully evaluate their income, deductions and financial goals before deciding which tax regime works better for them.",

        "full_content": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has announced a Rs 2,000 crore incentive scheme or subsidy for the popular digital payment method Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and RuPay debit card for the upcoming financial year in the Union Budget 2026.\n\nThis is close to the Rs 2,196 crore subsidy that the government is expected to spend in FY 25-26 as per the revised estimate of budget. However, it is well below the industry's expectation of around Rs 4,500 crore.\n\nThe actuals for FY 24-25 was also Rs 1,923 crore, as per the budget documents. The subsidy bill has not changed even though the payment platform has grown by 70 percent in volumes.\n\nAccording to payment companies, the platform needs around Rs 10,000-12,000 crore in annual subsidies to pay for the cost of investment to enhance the digital infrastructure for seamless payments and expansion into newer segments.\n\nUPI has been setting new records for transaction volume and value every month, with an annual growth rate of around 30 percent. January saw UPI transaction volume surpassing 21 billion, with value crossing Rs 28 lakh crore.\n\nThe Payments Council of India and other payment companies have requested a higher subsidy for UPI from the finance ministry this year,Moneycontrol reported. The companies have also asked the government to impose MDR for UPI and RuPay debit card payments.\n\nDigital transactions carry what is called a merchant discount rate (MDR), a fee that banks collect from merchants at the point of sale for facilitating digital payments. UPI MDR was 30 basis points before the government waived it in 2020. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.\n\nTo promote the adoption of digital payments, the government mandated that UPI transactions remain free for users, and in return, it will compensate payment firms for the costs they bear to facilitate them.\n\nIn 2024, the government subsidy for UPI was Rs 3,500 crore. As per the government policy, it provides 15 basis points (bps) of subsidy for UPI transactions below Rs 2,000.\n\nIn 2025, the likely subsidy bill would have been around Rs 6,000 crore, indicating a shortfall of Rs 4,500 crore in FY 2025 compared with the industry demands.\n\nUPI is the country’s most popular digital payment method, facilitating around 85 percent of all online transactions.\n\nPCI, which represents payment and fintech companies, has requested the reintroduction of 30bps or 0.3 percent as MDR on UPI payments for large merchants. Large merchants are those with a turnover of over Rs 40 lakh annually.\n\nIt also demanded that the government consider MDR for all Rupay debit card transactions, which aligns with the existing MDR structure for credit cards (around 2 percent) and for non-Rupay debit cards (around 0.75-0.9%).",

        "full_content": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced several measures on February 1, 2026; however, the government has decided to keep income tax slabs unchanged, offering stability in the tax structure but no fresh relief for individual taxpayers. The basic exemption limit has also been retained at the existing level, with no increase announced in this year’s Budget.\n\nUnder the new tax regime for FY 2027, salaried individuals under 60 will pay no tax on income up to Rs 4 lakh. Income between Rs 4 lakh and Rs 8 lakh will be taxed at 5 per cent, income between Rs 8 lakh and Rs 12 lakh at 10 per cent, income between Rs 12 lakh and Rs 16 lakh at 15 per cent, income between Rs 16 lakh and Rs 20 lakh at 20 per cent, income between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 24 lakh at 25 per cent, and income above Rs 24 lakh at 30 per cent. The standard deduction has been increased to Rs 75,000 for salaried employees. In addition, a rebate under Section 87A will be available for net taxable income up to Rs 12 lakh, making such income fully tax-free.\n\nThe standard deduction has also been kept unchanged at the current level. No increase was announced for salaried employees and pensioners. This means taxable income for most taxpayers will remain the same as in the previous year, unless there are changes in salary or other income sources.\n\nNo changes have been made to the old tax regime either. The existing slabs, exemptions and deductions continue as before. Taxpayers can still choose between the old and new regimes while filing their returns, depending on which option suits them better.\n\nExperts said the decision is likely to disappoint sections of the middle class that were expecting higher exemption limits or lower rates. With inflation and living costs rising, many taxpayers were hoping for additional relief in this Budget.\n\nAt the same time, experts said that keeping the slabs might encourage more people to gradually adopt the new tax system, which has lower rates but fewer exemptions. They also noted that the old system remains useful mainly for those with significant deductions from housingloans,insurance, provident fund contributions, and other investments.\n\nFor taxpayers without significant deductions, the new regime remains the simpler choice, even without any recent changes this year.",

        "full_content": "The Centre expects to receive Rs 3.16 lakh crore from the Reserve Bank of India and public sector banks in FY27, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in her Budget speech on February 1.\n\nThe dividend payout for the year is higher than last year’s when RBI gave the government Rs 2.68 lakh crore, double the total dividend Budgeted for FY25.\n\nThe RBI dividend is a major revenue source for the government. As the manager of its finances, every year, the RBI pays a dividend to government to help from its surplus profit.\n\nIn the current year, the RBI dividend has helped keep the fiscal deficit in check despite a decline in nominal growth and a faster pick-up in revenue expenditure.\n\nAccording to a Moneycontrol poll of economists, treasury heads, and market participants showed that government is expected to budget Rs 2-3 lakh crore as dividend income from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and public sector banks (PSBs) in the Union Budget 2026, higher than the Rs 2.56 lakh crore estimated in the previous budget.\n\nThe higher dividend projection is likely to be supported by the strong balance sheets of public sector banks and heightened volatility in currency markets, which has resulted in heavy dollar sales by the RBI, boosting its surplus income, poll respondents said.\n\nThe dividend estimate to be made in Budget 2026 will accrue in FY27, in line with the government’s accounting framework. The dividend projected in the earlier budget will be realised after the end of the current financial year, as banks typically declare and transfer dividends after finalising their annual results. The RBI, meanwhile, generally transfers its surplus to the government in May.\n\nIn May 2025, the central bank paid a record Rs 2.69 lakh crore dividend to the government, reflecting higher income from foreign exchange operations amid global market volatility.\n\nDividend transfers from the RBI and PSBs have emerged as a key source of non-tax revenue for the government in recent years, helping provide fiscal headroom even as capital expenditure remains a priority.",

        "full_content": "Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has proposed to implement the New Tax Act, 2025 from April 2026 while presenting the UnionBudget2026-27 in the Lok Sabha, marking her ninth consecutive budget presentation.\n\n“I announced a comprehensive review of the Income Tax Act, 1961 in July 2024. This has been completed in record time. The Income Tax Act, 2025 will come into effect from April 1, 2026… simplified rules & forms will be notified shortly,” said Finance Minister.\n\nThe Income Tax Act, 2025 is a comprehensive law that lays down the framework for the levy, administration, collection and recovery of direct taxes in India. Spread across more than 600 pages, it comprises 536 sections, 23 chapters and 16 schedules, covering virtually every aspect of taxation. The Act came into force on August 21, 2025, following the approval of the Income Tax Bill, 2025 by Parliament.\n\nIncome Tax Act 2025 key Changes\n\nThe Income Tax Act, 2025 marks a structural shift from the long-standing Income Tax Act, 1961, with the objective of simplifying tax law and improving clarity for taxpayers. While the 1961 Act has been in force since 1 April 1962, the new legislation is proposed to come into effect from 1 April 2026.\n\nOne of the most visible changes is in the overall framework: the older law is lengthy, highly detailed, and layered with multiple cross-references, whereas the 2025 Act adopts simpler language, a reorganised layout, and more concise provisions, even though the number of sections has increased.\n\nA key conceptual change is the replacement of the dual framework of “Previous Year” and “Assessment Year” with a single Tax Year, running from 1 April to 31 March. Under the new law, income earned in a tax year will be assessed in the succeeding tax year, reducing confusion caused by parallel year references.\n\nIn terms of tax regimes, the policy direction remains unchanged, with the new tax regime continuing as the default option, similar to Section 115BAC under the 1961 Act, now reflected in Section 202 of the new law.\n\nAnother important change relates to tax deduction at source (TDS). Earlier, TDS provisions were scattered across multiple sections ranging from Sections 192 to 194T. The 2025 Act consolidates these provisions under a single section—Section 393—without altering existing rates or thresholds. Overall, while the Income Tax Act, 2025 does not radically change tax rates or core principles, it aims to significantly reduce complexity by streamlining structure, modernising terminology, and making the law easier to navigate for taxpayers and administrators alike.",

Further minor offences will attract fine only. The remaining prosecutions will be graded commensurate with the quantum of offences. They will entail only simple imprisonment of maximum two years…” Sitharaman said.\n\nAlongside the decriminalisation measures, the finance minister proposed changes in timelines and processes for filing income tax returns to provide greater flexibility to taxpayers. She said the government plans to stagger filing deadlines across categories and allow revisions over a longer period.\n\n“I propose to extend time available for revising returns from 31st December to up to 31st March with the payment of a nominal fee. I also propose to stagger the timeline for filing of tax returns – individuals with ITR 1 and ITR 2 will continue to file till 31st July and non-audit business cases or trust are proposed to be allowed time till 31st August,” she said.\n\nThe Budget also addressed issues related to foreign asset disclosures, particularly for small-value holdings and specific groups such as students.\n\n“There is no penalty presently for non-disclosure of non-immovable foreign assets with aggregate value of less than Rs 20 lakh. I propose to also provide them with immunity from prosecution with retrospective effect from October 1, 2024,” Sitharaman said.\n\nShe further announced, “For 1-time six-month foreign asset disclosure scheme for a special set of people including students who didn’t disclose overseas assets/income (limit Rs 1 crore) and those who did disclose such assets or income (asset value up to Rs 5 crore).”\n\nTaken together, the proposals claim to simplify tax administration, reduce criminal proceedings for procedural lapses, and encourage voluntary compliance through more accommodative policies.",

At the same time, the Budget proposes additional flexibility for other categories of taxpayers and targeted simplification in cross-border transactions.\n\nAs per the proposals, non-audit cases such as certain businesses and trusts will now be allowed to file their returns up to August 31, extending the compliance window beyond July. The move is aimed at easing pressure on smaller entities that often struggle with tight filing timelines.\n\nIn another significant announcement, Sitharaman said taxpayers will be given more time to revise their income-tax returns. Under the proposal, revised returns can be filed up to March 31, subject to payment of a nominal fee. This is expected to help individuals correct genuine errors or omissions without facing harsher penalties.\n\nKey ITR deadlines proposed under Budget 2026\n\nThe Budget also addresses compliance issues in real estate transactions involving non-residents. The finance minister proposed shifting the responsibility of tax deducted at source (TDS) compliance in cases of immovable property purchases from non-residents to resident buyers. This will be enabled through a PAN-based challan system, eliminating the need for buyers to obtain a tax deduction and collection account number (TAN).\n\nAdditionally, Sitharaman announced a one-time six-month foreign asset disclosure window for small taxpayers. This scheme is targeted at individuals such as students, young professionals, technology employees and relocated NRIs who may have inadvertently failed to disclose overseas assets. The disclosure window is intended to encourage voluntary compliance without triggering penal consequences.\n\nThe proposed changes are expected to impact sectors such as tax and compliance technology, real estate transactions, NRI and remittance services, and wealth management and tax advisory firms.",

ARPOB grew 9% y/y (up 2% q/q) to Rs58,362, while occupancy stood at 47.2% vs. 53.2/52% in Q3FY25/Q2FY26. While mature hospitals’ occupancy came in at 52.6% (vs. 60.3/55.9% in Q3FY25/Q2FY26), new hospitals’ occupancy stood at 38.8% (vs. 39.6/44.3% in Q3FY25/Q2FY26). It added ~780 beds over the past two years. As it effectively concluded current expansion cycle, profitability is likely to improve in the coming period with ramp-up of new units. Other key highlights include: (a) recently acquired 100-bed Prashanthi hospital in Warangal contributed Rs70mn in Q3FY26; (b) it added 90beds capacity in Bengaluru’s Electronic City in Jan-26 and Hennur (60) is likely to be operational in Q4FY26e; (c) it plans to get into Pune market with 150-bed facility on build-to-suit model (greenfield), which is likely to begin by FY29; and (d) net cash stood at Rs5.8bn as of Dec-25.\n\nWe believe Rainbow’s moat is its calibrated focus on paediatric and perinatal services, a model nascent in India. Given its strong pedigree and hold on unit economics, it is poised to replicate this model in other Indian cities. We expect its revenue and EBITDA to clock 14% CAGR each over FY25-28e, aided by capacity addition and improved operating leverage. We maintain BUY rating on the stock with a revised TP of Rs1,600 (from Rs1,780 earlier), valuing it at 22x FY28e EV/EBITDA.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

The scale of the challenge is evident in global comparisons. India’s corporate bond market accounts for only about 16–17 per cent of GDP, far below equity market capitalisation of over 130 per cent of GDP.\n\nIn contrast, South Korea’s corporate bond market stands at 79 per cent of GDP, Malaysia’s at 54 per cent and China’s at 38 per cent. Moreover, India’s bond market is heavily skewed towards highly rated issuers, with 85–90 per cent of issuances concentrated in AAA and AA categories.",

        "full_content": "India’s capital expenditure allocation is set to cross Rs 12.2 lakh crore for the first time in FY27, according to the Union Budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1. The increase underscores the government’s continued emphasis on public investment as a key lever to support growth at a time when private capex remains uneven.\n\nThe Budget estimate is broadly in line with the Moneycontrol poll of 20 economists, which had projected nominal GDP growth of 10.1 percent and capital spending of around Rs 12 lakh crore in the coming fiscal. Even though the pace of increase in capex has slowed, the headline number marks a meaningful rise from the Rs 11.21 lakh crore allocated in the previous year’s estimates.\n\nThe moderation in growth becomes clearer in a year-on-year comparison. Between FY25 and FY26 estimates, the government had raised capital expenditure by just Rs 10,000 crore, reflecting fiscal constraints as consolidation efforts gathered pace.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, crossing the Rs 12.2 lakh crore mark signals a renewed push to keep public investment elevated, even as revenue growth normalises.\n\nThe government is betting that sustained capex will help revive private investment, which has so far remained muted and concentrated in a handful of sectors.\n\nThe thrust is consistent with the Economic Survey, released on January 28, which made a strong case for protecting capital expenditure. The Survey argued that capex delivers more durable gains in household incomes and living standards than transfer-led spending, by improving infrastructure, supporting employment and raising productivity.\n\nAt the same time, the Survey cautioned that uncertainty—particularly sector-specific regulatory and policy uncertainty—has a disproportionate dampening effect on private capital formation. To address this, it called for simpler, more predictable regulatory frameworks, targeted deregulation and stable policy regimes, especially in sectors that are highly sensitive to uncertainty shocks.",

The discussion also brought a significant update from Ashishkumar Chauhan, Managing Director and CEO of the National Stock Exchange (NSE), who expressed hope that the NSE could be listed by this year's Diwali Muhurat trading session.\n\nNilesh Shah of Kotak Mahindra AMC laid out a formidable challenge for the Finance Minister, terming it the 'Trinity of impossible'. His wishlist includes continuing government spending on infrastructure investment while private investment remains subdued, honouring the commitment to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio, and achieving this by boosting non-tax revenue through asset monetization and divestment, rather than raising taxes. Extending this theme, Shah proposed creating a 'DG Yatra for entrepreneurs', a system analogous to the seamless airport entry process, to streamline and accelerate both foreign and local investments.\n\nLive Updates|Share market on Budget day; Sensex, Nifty news\n\nEchoing the need for policy stability, Gautam Chhaochharia of UBS stated his primary expectation from the budget is for there to be “no negative surprises.” He emphasized the importance of a long-term plan backed by specific policies to provide clarity and stability. Chhaochharia also noted that market participants are hoping for positive surprises, such as potential tax cuts for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs).\n\nDelving deeper into the FPI issue, Nilesh Shah highlighted a key anomaly in the current tax structure. He pointed out that many foreign entities, such as endowment and pension funds, are tax-exempt in their home countries but are required to pay taxes in India. “While our returns could be higher on a post-tax basis, there is a mindset issue where I don't pay tax in my country, how can I pay tax in another country,” Shah explained. He proposed a rationalization of this policy by extending the capital gains tax exemptions, currently available to sovereign funds from countries like Singapore and the Middle East, to all FPIs that are tax-exempt in their own jurisdictions.\n\nOn the topic of the Securities Transaction Tax (STT), NSE chief Ashishkumar Chauhan acknowledged that such a tax is known to create friction in markets. However, he provided the government's perspective, noting that STT generates substantial revenue, estimated at ₹60,000-70,000 crore annually. He stressed that any relaxation or abolishment of STT would be a balancing act for the government, which would need to find alternative sources for these funds.\n\nWhen asked about the sectoral priority for the budget to drive the investment climate, Nilesh Shah offered a one-word answer: “Liberalization.” He argued that liberalizing the environment for entrepreneurs would be the most effective way to spur growth, allowing them to identify and pursue opportunities.",

        "full_content": "The Indian rupee's recent and swift depreciation to the 92 level has become a significant point of concern, especially when viewed against the country's robust economic fundamentals. Economist Jahangir Aziz, in a discussion with CNBC TV18, broke down this paradox, arguing that the currency's weakness is not driven by economic performance but by a critical shortfall in capital flows.\n\nAziz began by highlighting the strong macroeconomic indicators that should theoretically support the rupee. He pointed to an official gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate between 7.5% and 8%, inflation dropping below 3% after a prolonged period, and a manageable current account deficit (CAD) of just 1% of GDP. Coupled with oil prices at a low of $55 per barrel and trending downward, he asserted that from a fundamental standpoint, the \"rupee shouldn't be at 92.\"\n\nLive updates|Union Budget 2026\n\nThe central problem, Aziz diagnosed, lies in the inability to finance even a modest deficit. \"If India ever achieved 1% of GDP of current account deficit, that would have been seen as an exceedingly good year. Today we can't fund 1% of GDP. Not too long ago, we were funding two and a half, 3% of GDP,\" he explained. This stark contrast points directly to a problem with the capital account, affecting both Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI).\n\nDiving deeper into the issue, Aziz suggested the FDI story is more complex than a general global slowdown. While gross FDI may appear stable, the critical issue is a lack of reinvestment from key players. Based on anecdotal evidence from market participants, he identified a specific trend among private equity (PE) firms. According to Aziz, many PE firms that invested in India five to six years ago and achieved successful exits through Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) are now choosing not to reinvest their proceeds back into the country.\n\nThis lack of reinvestment from entities whose primary business is risk-taking raises a fundamental question. \"The question that you need to ask is why are institutions or why are agencies, firms whose only job is to take risk, no longer taking risk on India,\" Aziz concluded. This suggests that the rupee's weakness may be a symptom of shifting investor confidence and risk perception rather than a reflection of underlying economic health.",

It also extended registration validity under Section 12AB from five to 10 years for qualifying smaller trusts.\n\nClarity would benefit trusts registered prior to April 1, 2025, said chartered accountant Suresh Surana. \"Where such trusts satisfy the prescribed income threshold of Rs 5 crore in each of the two years preceding the previous year in which the application is made, it would be helpful if the 10-year validity is applied automatically, without requiring a fresh renewal application upon the expiry of the initial five-year period. This would be aligned with the stated intent of reducing procedural burden for smaller entities,\" he said.\n\nSection 13 revisions specify that individuals with annual contributions exceeding Rs 1 lakh or total contributions exceeding Rs 10 lakh are not eligible for tax exemptions. These updates aim to make procedures easier for smaller trusts while maintaining regulatory standards.\n\nSmall charitable trusts are burdened with compliance, and one of the compliance requirements is related to filing Form 10BD, providing details of donations received. There is no threshold above which details are required to be submitted, and a trust is expected to take details from even small donors, Mihir Tanna, Associate Director of Direct Tax at SK Patodia & Associate LLP, said. “Thus, if necessary changes are proposed in Budget 2026, small charitable trust should get a relief,\"  Tanna said.\n\nExperts suggest easier registration and reporting for small trusts. More targeted audits focused on high-value contributions and clearer definitions to avoid confusion around eligibility.\n\n\"Moreover, introducing a similar 10-year approval framework under Section 80G(5) for eligible trusts would ensure consistency across provisions and significantly ease repetitive compliance,\" Surana said.\n\nFinance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present her ninth consecutive Union Budget on February 1, a fete unmatched in Independent India history.

        "full_content": "To attract foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) back to its shores, India needs to address specific tax “irritants” and ensure policy stability, rather than relying on the assumption that global capital has no other option, according to Arvind Sanger, Managing Partner at Geosphere Capital Management. Speaking on CNBC TV18 ahead of the Union Budget, Sanger said the focus should be on supply-side reforms to revive economic activity, even if that involves some short-term fiscal leeway.\n\nSanger identified the tax charged at the fund level in India as a significant deterrent for FPIs, describing it as “pretty unique” and “punitive”. He explained that for investors from countries without a double taxation avoidance agreement, this results in being taxed twice—once at the India fund level and again at the personal level in their home country. The discussion also touched upon the idea of exempting sovereign and endowment funds from long-term capital gains tax, which was presented as politically easier to sell than a blanket exemption for all FPIs.\n\nAccording to Sanger, the Union Budget has become “way less important” than it once was, with major reforms increasingly taking place outside the annual budget cycle. He said continued supply-side reform was needed to encourage growth, and that policymakers should not be overly focused on short-term fiscal metrics. Drawing a parallel with GST cuts that could temporarily impact collections, Sanger argued that some fiscal flexibility may be necessary to revive economic activity, while stressing that he was not advocating reckless fiscal expansion.\n\nSanger also said India has come to be viewed as the “anti-AI trade”, calling it a “very narrow space to occupy”. While there may be phases when the global AI trade unwinds and India benefits, he cautioned that the country needs to stand on its own growth fundamentals. He warned against the belief that foreign investors have no alternative but India, noting that markets such as Korea, Taiwan and China are seen as beneficiaries of the AI cycle.\n\nOn policy credibility, Sanger flagged concerns around retroactive changes, citing a recent Supreme Court decision on back taxes as another irritant for foreign investors. He said such actions undermine confidence by creating uncertainty over whether existing rules will continue to apply in the future, adding that this was not how an economy of India’s stature should function.",

        "full_content": "While equity mutual funds continue to enjoy a favourable capital gains tax structure, debt mutual funds remain at a disadvantage, lowering investor interest. Long-term and short-term gains on debt funds no longer receive concessional tax treatment; redemption proceeds are taxed at the investor’s slab rate. This has reduced the appeal of debt products at a time when a more developed and efficient corporate bond market is needed to channel long-term savings into productive investments.\n\nExperts expect the Union Budget to focus on reducing the cost of capital and strengthening the corporate bond market through potential tax reforms.\n\nCurrently, debt mutual funds are taxed at the investor’s marginal income tax rate, regardless of the holding period, following the removal of indexation benefits in 2023. This has made them less attractive compared to equity or direct bond investments.\n\n“If the government targets a lower fiscal deficit than expected, it could push bond yields lower, increasing the NAV of existing debt or fixed income funds. The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) has proposed restoring Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) benefits for debt funds to reverse the decline in inflows,” said Sameer Mathur, MD and founder of Roinet Solution.\n\nMarket consensus also expects RBI to hold policy rates steady through 2026, anchoring short-rates and reducing volatility in short and medium-term debt instruments. Mathur said, “Short-duration and ultra-short funds may benefit from stable policy rates and RBI liquidity operations.”\n\nFrom a budget perspective, experts have been pushing over the past few years to align fixed income with other asset classes and to support the development of collateral frameworks. However, fund flows have not significantly shifted toward traditional fixed income products, mainly because they remain tax-inefficient. As a result, investors are missing out on a crucial asset class.\n\n“Tax clarity and incentives, if announced, will be a major positive driver for debt funds, potentially improving net yields after tax and catalysing inflows. Investors should look for opportunities in the corporate bond market as the government seeks to deepen this segment,” added Mathur.\n\nTraditional fixed-income products, however, remain excluded. “Introducing indexation would significantly enhance the attractiveness of fixed income for average savers, particularly those within the Rs 12 lakh income bracket,” said Sachin Jain, Managing Partner, Scripbox.\n\nJain said ironically, retirees, despite relying heavily on fixed income due to pension income, are often forced into conservative hybrid products purely for tax efficiency, which may not always align with their risk profiles. “This highlights the need for policy correction. Additionally, the development of a robust listed bond market has been a long-pending reform that remains unaddressed,” he said.\n\nUntil market infrastructure develops further, mutual fund fixed income continues to be the most stable option for retail investors. Implementing indexation is thus a vital and timely reform to help restore stability and investor trust in the fixed income sector.",

It replaces a temporary levy on cigarettes and tobacco products.\n\nThe excise duty would be imposed on cigarettes in addition to a 40 percent GST, according to an order issued late on Wednesday. The finance ministry notified that an excise duty of Rs 2,050–8,500 per 1,000 sticks, depending on cigarette length, will take effect from February 1.\n\nTotal taxes on cigarettes in India currently account for about 53 percent of the retail prices, well below the World Health Organization (WHO) benchmark of 75 percent which is aimed at discouraging consumption. This includes a 28 percent goods and services tax and additional value-based levy based on the size of the cigarettes.\n\nThe duty translates into a 22-28 percent increase in overall costs for 75-85 mm cigarettes, analysts at ICICI Securities said. \"Cigarettes longer than 75 mm account for roughly 16% of ITC's volumes and are likely to see price increases of 2–3 rupees per stick as a result of the levy,\" they said.\n\nITCshares had declined nearly 17 percent during a nine-day losing streak between January 1 and January 13. Prabhudas Lilladher in its latest research report lowered its target price for the shares of ITC to Rs 314 apiece from Rs 348 earlier, while maintaining its ‘Reduce’ call. The latest target price implies a downside potential of more than 1 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 318.6 apiece.\n\nThe domestic brokerage said that it remains“cautious” on the cigarettes segment, as it expects a 22–50% price increase due to new excise rates which could impact volumes and profitability in the near term. “However, we expect ITC to do well in other category given 1) likely decline in wood prices and benefits of MIP imposition in paper board 2) expected further recovery in demand and margins in FMCG business led by favorable macro policies. FMCG business displayed resilience with Digital First & Organic portfolio growing by 60% in Q3,” it added.\n\nGodfrey Phillipsshares meanwhile fell 18.5 percent between January 2-3.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

The index however recorded 0.74 percent gains in January overall.\n\nThe index snapped a three-session gaining streak on January 30.\n\nDespite facing early selling pressure on Friday, the index displayed notable resilience by defending its crucial support zone and sustaining above the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), said Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivatives Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities.\n\nThis price behaviour has gradually shifted the near-term bias in favour of the bulls, he further said, adding that the index appears well-placed for a healthier recovery from a technical perspective. “The improving price behaviour lends credibility to the ongoing recovery attempt. A sustained move above 60,100 could inject fresh momentum into the uptrend. The 60,100–60,300 band, which previously acted as a strong demand zone, has now evolved into a key supply area and overlaps with the prior all-time-high supply zone. This confluence makes it a critical inflection point for the index,” the analyst said.\n\nOsho Krishan, Chief Manager -Technical and Derivative research at Angel One, sees the Bank Nifty finding support at 59,200 and then at 58,700 on the downside, and resistance at 60,000 and then at 60,400 on the upside.\n\n“Bank Nifty has reclaimed its falling trendline breakout zone and is now sustaining above its short-term 20-day and 50-day moving averages, indicating improving price structure. Momentum indicators are also supportive, with RSI witnessing a bullish crossover, suggesting strengthening upside bias. However, on the derivatives front, the 60000 strike holds the highest open interest from both call and put writers, making it a crucial pivot level. Being a high-beta index, volatility is expected, with support placed at 59000 and resistance near 60400 levels,” said Vatsal Bhuva, Technical Analyst at LKP Securities.\n\nAakash Shah, Technical Research Analyst at Choice Broking said that technical indicators suggest a “cautiously optimistic outlook” for Bank Nifty. “The index demonstrated notable strength by decisively breaking above the key resistance at 59,500 and forming a bullish piercing pattern on the weekly timeframe, which signals a potential bullish reversal and improving market sentiment,” he said.\n\nThe analyst cautioned that if selling pressure re-emerges and the index fails to sustain above 59,500, a decisive breakdown could trigger a deeper corrective move towards the 59,000–58,500 zone, with the risk of further downside extension. “On the upside, immediate resistance is placed at 60,000, followed by 60,200 and 60,400,” he added.\n\n“The pullback appears to have offered a healthy buying opportunity rather than a trend reversal. The daily RSI stands near 52, indicating neutral to improving momentum with room for further upside…On the downside, the 59300–59250 zone remains a crucial support; a decisive break below this range could drag the index toward 58700. On the upside, 60000 is a key psychological resistance, with sustained strength above it opening the path toward 60500. Volatility is expected to remain elevated ahead of the upcoming Union Budget,” said Ravi Singh, Chief Research Officer from Master Capital Services.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

It expects domestic two-wheeler growth of 12-15 percent, alongside export growth of 20-25 percent year-on-year, with margins expected to hold up in Q4 despite some commodity pressure.\n\nNomuraretained aNeutralrating with a target price ofRs 10,446, saying that margins were supported by higher PLI benefits. While it sees domestic market share recovery as a key catalyst, Nomura views valuations of around 20 times FY28 earnings as fair.\n\nValuation concerns temper optimism at higher levels\n\nJefferieskept aHoldrating with a cautious tone, setting a target ofRs 9,100. While positive on India two-wheeler demand and export momentum, Jefferies flagged concerns over domestic motorcycle market share loss. It also highlighted that Bajaj Auto stock trades at 24 times FY27 earnings -- a premium to its long-term average valuation of 21x.\n\nUBSmaintained aSellrating with a target price ofRs 9,015, saying that Bajaj Auto’s motorcycle-heavy mix remains a structural challenge despite a supportive industry outlook. UBS acknowledged that a three-wheeler mix and lower staff costs supported margins, and noted that electric vehicles accounted for around 25 percent of domestic revenue in Q3.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "The prices of gold and silver crashed last week, after a sharp bull run to lifetime highs earlier. Analysts expect near-term corrections to persist, but the long-term structural drivers remain intact.\n\nThesharp fall in gold and silver pricescame amid rampant profit-booking, along with stronger dollar. Additionally, US President Donald Trump said he had chosen former ⁠Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, who is known to be hawkish and rigid about rate cuts, to ⁠head ⁠the American central bank.\n\nGold, silver prices crashed on Friday:\n\nGold futures with April expiry on MCX dropped around 9 percent to hit a low of Rs 1,67,406 per 10 grams on Friday. This came a day after the contracts hit a fresh lifetime high of Rs 1,93,096 per 10 grams. This means that the gold futures fell 13 percent (Rs 25,690 per 10 grams) in just one day.\n\nSilver futures with March expiry meanwhile dropped nearly 17 percent to Rs 3,32,002 per kilogram on Friday. This marks a fall of nearly 21 percent (Rs 88,046 per kilogram) in just one day after hitting a fresh lifetime high of Rs 4,20,048 per kg.\n\nSpot silver on COMEX dropped around 30 percent in two days to close at $85.250 per ounce on Friday. Spot gold meanwhile fell around 13 percent during the same period to close at $4,879.60 per ounce.\n\nAs a result, gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) mirrored the sharp fall and plunged as much as 24 percent after a sharp run-up.\n\nNikunj Saraf, CEO of Choice Wealth, said that the sharp fall in gold and silver ETFs is not mysterious—it is classic profit-taking after Thursday’s record highs on MCX. “A hawkish Fed chair pick under President Trump sparked global fears of tighter policy, strengthening the USD and crushing overbought metals,” he said.\n\nFor investors, this dip tests conviction, according to the analyst. He advised investors to diversify, avoid panic selling, and eye rebounds from central bank demand. “Long-term bulls hold firm,” Saraf added.\n\nSilver has exhibited a remarkable rally over the past year. This reflects a blend of safe-haven demand, tight supply and structurally rising industrial consumption across solar, electronics and manufacturing, which is particularly relevant to India’s growth story, said Rajkumar Subramanian, Head - Product & Family Office, PL Wealth.\n\nHe however added that silver remains a volatile metal, with historical annualised volatility often in the 25–35 percent range, higher than gold. The sharp run-up increases the risk of near-term corrections, the analysyt noted.\n\n“From an investment perspective, we recommend calibrated, staggered allocations rather than lump-sum deployment to manage entry-point risk while retaining exposure to silver’s longer-term structural drivers,” he said.\n\n“Technical indicators show the [precious metals] market is overbought, raising the likelihood of short-term corrections. A stabilization in geopolitics, stronger U.S. dollar, reduced investor risk aversion, or an improvement in mine output could also ease upward pressure on prices,” said Hareesh V, Head of Commodity Research, Geojit Investments.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "Brokerages were divided on the outlook for Nestle India Ltd after the FMCG major delivered a strong, volume-led performance in Q3 FY26. While analysts pointed to a sustained recovery in demand and stepped-up brand investments, concerns around near-term margin pressure and rich valuations tempered optimism on the stock.\n\nMost brokerages saidNestle India’s fiscal third-quarter performance marked one of its strongest volume upcycles in recent years, supported by broad-based growth across categories and channels. However, the sharp increase in advertising and promotion (A&P) spending -- though strategically positive -- has weighed on operating margins, limiting near-term upside expectations.\n\nNestle India reported a strong set of Q3 FY26 results, posting an 18.5 percent year-on-year rise in revenue to a record Rs 5,667 crore and a 46 percent jump in net profit to Rs 1,018 crore, aided by a one-time tax write-back. EBITDA grew 9 percent on-year, though margins narrowed sharply due to a 42 percent surge in advertising and promotion spends. Following the results, Nestle India shares rose 3.5 percent on Friday. The stock has returned over 15 percent in one year, outperforming Nifty 50.\n\nNestle India stock call: Brokerages offer mixed views\n\nAnalysts broadly agreed that Nestle India's Q3 FY26 performance signals improving consumption trends and better demand elasticity. At the same time, they cautioned that the current phase of aggressive brand investment, while supportive of medium-term growth, could delay operating leverage.\n\nNomurawas bullish on Nestle India stock, reiterating aBuyrating with a target price ofRs 1,450per share, implying nearly9 percent upsidefrom current levels. The brokerage said Nestle India delivered another clear earnings beat, driven by strong volume and mix growth of around 16 percent year-on-year. While operating margins declined due to a 42 percent on-year surge in A&P spends, Nomura noted that stable raw material costs are aiding sequential margin recovery. It also flagged valuation as a constraint, with the stock trading at around 60 times FY28 earnings.\n\nIn contrast,CLSAmaintained aHoldrating with a target price ofRs 1,311. The brokerage highlighted that Q3 sales growth materially exceeded expectations and was largely volume-driven, particularly in the domestic business. It said EBITDA also beat estimates despite pressure from elevated brand investments and raised Nestle India’s FY26-28 earnings estimates by 3-5 percent.\n\nJefferiesalso stayed atHold, with a target price ofRs 1,300. The brokerage pointed to Nestle India’s strongest volume-led topline growth in nearly three years, with three of four segments delivering strong value growth. While higher brand investments weighed on margins in the short term, Jefferies said elevated A&P spending should support medium-term growth and category expansion.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "Domestic benchmarks Nifty 50 and Sensex are likely to open the Union Budget session on weak footing, as poor global cues, persistent FII outflows, and a weak currency dampen sentiment.\n\nMarkets are likely to remain highly volatile, with sharp moves possible in either direction depending on key announcements around fiscal policy, capex push, sector-specific incentives, and the fiscal deficit target (expected around 4.3–4.4% of GDP for FY27), according to analysts.\n\nOn Friday, the S&P 500 its decline on Friday, with the benchmark index slipping 0.43 percent, marking its third consecutive losing session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.36 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperformed, sliding 0.94 percent. All three major indexes were down more than 1 percent at their intraday lows.\n\nStocks retreated as technology shares stayed under pressure, even as investors broadly welcomed President Donald Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve chair.\n\nA favourable Budget reaction could trigger an upside breakout, while any disappointment or profit-booking may pull indices back towards lower support zones. “Until there is clarity from the Budget, the overall bias remains cautious to neutral,” said Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money.\n\nIn the previous session, the Nifty declined 0.4 percent to snap a three-day winning streak weighed down by sharp losses in metal and IT stocks.\n\nHowever, between the last Budget and now, benchmark indices delivered modest returns, masking wide dispersion beneath the surface. Midcaps outperformed, but smallcaps slipped marginally, down 0.5 percent, reflecting tighter liquidity and selective risk-taking.\n\nIndia's underperformance becomes more pronounced when viewed against global peers in dollar terms. While the Sensex and Nifty delivered returns of just 0.3 percent and 1.8 percent respectively (in dollar terms), several global indices posted outsized gains. The Nasdaq climbed 20.7 percent, the S&P 500 rose 15.4 percent, and Japan's Nikkei jumped 37 percent.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, investors are looking to the upcoming Budget for clarity on growth support, fiscal discipline and sector-specific triggers that could broaden participation and restore confidence. Whether the next budget can reverse India's relative underperformance and revive risk appetite remains the key question as markets turn the page to a new fiscal year.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

This comes as investors actively await how markets will react to Union Budget 2026, which is set to be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman today.\n\nGold and silver prices have seen a significant decline in the second half of last week, after scaling fresh lifetime highs just before.\n\nGold, silver prices crashed on Friday:\n\nGold futures with April expiry on MCX dropped around 9 percent to hit a low of Rs 1,67,406 per 10 grams on Friday.

The shares of other gold financiers likeManappuram Financeand IIFL Finance meanwhile fell around 4 percent each.\n\nThe shares of Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) tumbled more than 6 percent to end the session at Rs 2,515 apiece on Friday.Hindustan Zinc, which is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity, saw isshares crash around 12.5 percentto Rs 626 apiece. Vedanta shares dropped more than 11 percent.\n\nWhat lies ahead for gold and silver?\n\nLast week’s sharp fall in gold and silver prices can be explained as a classic bout of profit-booking after an extended record rally and not as a breakdown in fundamental sentiments, said Pranav Koomar, Founder and CEO of PlusCash.\n\nWhile high positioning, strong dollar movements, and an uptick in bond yields have contributed to a correction in gold prices, from a medium- to a long-term perspective, the prices have continued to find support due to global uncertainty, buying from Central Banks, and tight supply dynamics, the analyst added.\n\nInvestors should consider any fall as a buying opportunity and not a sign of any change in the trend, Koomar said.\n\nManeesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers, noted that the sharp moves in precious metals seen today reflected speculation that Warsh may be less enthusiastic to cut rates than other candidates, given his past warnings of inflation risks and more recent calls for the Fed to reduce its balance sheet.\n\n\"Going ahead markets could now look ahead to more cues from labor market reports due next week in US which could show signs of weakening labor markets, while local markets could remain glued towards Union budget announcement due on Sunday. Any signs of changes in Import duty structure could reflect directly into MCX prices. Overall volatility with a corrective bias is expected to persist for few more sessions before markets stabilize at lower levels,\" Sharma added.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman is set to announce the Union Budget for the financial year 2026-27. Most experts expect the government to increase capital expenditure on February 1 to boost infrastructure and defence which has remained the pivotal theme for the government, while maintaining fiscal deficit of 4.4 percent of GDP or lowering it to 4.3-4.2 percent for FY27. The Centre is also expected to continue focussing on supporting consumption and increasing industrial output, but unlikely to announce significant changes in personal taxes. Considering the mega economic event, analysts suggest betting on and focus on these 11 stocks today:\n\nSiddhartha Khemka, Head of Research – Wealth Management at Motilal Oswal Financial Services\n\nNMDC stands to benefit from the Budget’s emphasis on manufacturing and supply-chain security through the critical minerals mission, alongside sustained infrastructure capex, which supports long-term demand visibility and reinforces the government’s push toward domestic resource development and import substitution.\n\nGoing forward, volumes are expected to rise steadily to 51 million tonnes (MT) in FY27 and 54MT in FY28, aided by EC enhancements and stable realizations. NMDC’s ongoing capex toward evacuation and capacity projects is set to lift capacity to 100MT by FY29-30.\n\nBharat Electronics| Target: Rs 520\n\nBharat Electronics is well positioned as the Budget is expected to prioritise defence and allied sectors, with defence capex growth of ~15% over the planned FY26 base. Additionally, with the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) recently approving significant capital acquisition proposals, amplifying orderbook visibility; sustained emphasis on indigenisation and strategic electronics underpins long-term demand alongside supportive macro liquidity.\n\nBharat Electronics continues to remain a key beneficiary of large platform orders across Army, Navy, Airforce as it stands to benefit from large orders like QRSAM, Next generation corvettes, Akash-NG along with the base orders.\n\nWith improved indigenization levels and operating leverage benefits, we expect strong margin performance of Bharat Electronics to continue. We expect revenue/PAT to grow at 18%/16% CAGR over FY25-28.\n\nLarsen & Toubro| Target: Rs 4,600\n\nLarsen & Toubro remains a key Budget beneficiary as capital expenditure is expected to grow ~10% YoY and stay near ~3% of GDP, with continued focus on roads, railways, defence, and urban infrastructure, supporting strong order inflows amid a supportive macro and liquidity environment. L&T aims to add nearly 4-5GW of thermal power projects over the next two years out of the total opportunity of 10-15GW ordering in the sector.\n\nIt is also eyeing opportunities in nuclear EPC projects. We factor in order inflows to grow at 13% CAGR over FY25-28 for core E&C segment. L&T’s risk-mitigation framework for mega projects and growing international diversification further strengthen execution visibility. We expect core E&C revenue/EBITDA/PAT to grow at a CAGR of 16%/18%/22%.\n\nSBI Life Insurance Company| Target: Rs 2,750\n\nSBI Life should remain in focus as insurance sector reforms, including higher FDI limits and distribution architecture changes, align with the government’s financial inclusion agenda, while benign inflation and steady income growth support long-term protection demand; pending regulatory changes toward composite licences to sell health insurance could materially expand its addressable market.\n\nManagement has retained APE (annual premium equivalent) growth guidance of 13–14% with momentum sustaining into FY27. GST impact is expected to be offset by product mix and efficiency, limiting net impact to ~30–40bp. We expect FY25–28 APE/VNB CAGR at 15%/16%, with operating RoEV above 18%.\n\nDevarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities\n\nKNR Constructions| Target: Rs 240\n\nKNR Constructions is poised to benefit from higher MoRTH allocations, asset monetization via InvITs, and budgetary focus on irrigation and river-linking projects. With NHAI’s bidding silence ending in November 2025, the January-March 2026 tender cycle could drive Rs 8,000-10,000 crore inflows. Diversification into mining, solar, and urban infra, alongside favorable bidding norms, supports a strong recovery trajectory by FY27.\n\nJupiter Wagons| Target: Rs 355\n\nJupiter Wagons is set to benefit from a 5-10% YoY rise in railway allocations, supporting India’s “Viksit Bharat” vision. A capex pivot toward rolling stock induction, alongside higher spending on the Dedicated Freight Corridor, logistics infrastructure, multi-modal warehousing, and safety upgrades like Kavach 4.0, positions the company for sustained growth within the expanding rail ecosystem.\n\nGarden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers| Target: Rs 3,110\n\nThe Government of India could prioritise Atmanirbharta (self-reliance) in defence by adopting modern techniques, including artificial intelligence and robotics. Maintaining a strong net worth amid moderate capital expenditure (capex), robust order book, and healthy cash accruals should continue to support GRSE over the medium term. Investors can buy the stock with a target price of Rs 3110. At the LTP of Rs 2,764, the stock is trading at 31.3x FY28E EPS.\n\nHindustan Aeronautics| Target: Rs 5,585\n\nDefence budget is expected to rise 8-10% and capital allocation to increase to Rs 2.1–2.3 lakh crore, implying a 20–30% YoY growth. HAL is the market leader in aerospace, and the company is also focused on developing indigenous aircraft and helicopters, which could provide revenue visibility over the next 5-10 years. Investors can buy the stock with a target price of Rs 5,585. At the LTP of Rs 4,619, the stock is trading at 32.9x FY28E EPS.\n\nNarendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research - Investment Services at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers\n\nTVS Motor Company| Target: Rs 4,350\n\nTVS Motor Company reported strong Q3 FY26 performance, with operating revenue rising 37% YoY to Rs 12,476 crore. Operating EBITDA grew 51% to Rs 1,634 crore, driving record EBITDA margins of 13.1% (vs 12.4% last year), while PBT before exceptional items increased 57% YoY to Rs 1,315 crore. For the nine months ending December 2025, operating revenue rose 29% YoY to Rs 34,463 crore. Operating EBITDA increased 41% to Rs 4,406 crore, while PBT before exceptional items grew 43% to Rs 3,594 crore. PAT also rose strongly to Rs 2,625 crore from Rs 1,858 crore in the same period last year.\n\nTVS Motor recorded its highest-ever quarterly sales in Q3 FY26, with total two- and three-wheeler volumes (including international) rising 27% YoY to 15.44 lakh units, driven by robust growth in motorcycles (+31%), scooters (+25%), and a sharp rebound in three-wheelers. This momentum sustained over 9M FY26, with volumes up 23% YoY to 43.28 lakh units, supported by healthy growth across motorcycles and scooters, and continued recovery in three-wheelers.\n\nInternational business remained a key growth driver, with two-wheeler sales outside India increasing 35% YoY in both Q3 FY26 and 9M FY26. Volumes reached 3.66 lakh units in Q3 FY26 and 10.47 lakh units for the nine-month period, highlighting TVS Motor’s strengthening global footprint.\n\nEV sales continued to scale up strongly, with Q3 FY26 volumes rising 40% YoY to an all-time high of 1.06 lakh units. For 9M FY26, EV sales increased 26% YoY to 2.56 lakh units, reinforcing the company’s leadership and traction in the electric two-wheeler segment.\n\nTVS Jupiter emerged as the Most Preferred Scooter Brand for FY26, underlining strong brand equity in the mass segment. The company also entered the adventure rally-tourer category with the launch of the premium Apache RTX, which was crowned Indian Motorcycle of the Year 2026, supporting premiumization and portfolio expansion.\n\nWaaree Energies| Target: Rs 3,849\n\nIts revenue/EBITDA/PAT grew by 118.8%/167.2%/118.4% YoY to Rs 7,565/Rs 1,928/ Rs 1,106 crore in Q3FY26, mainly led by strong production of cells (0.8 GW in Q3FY26 vs 0.6 GW in Q3FY25) & modules (3.5 GW in Q3 FY26 vs 1.8 GW in Q3FY25).\n\nWaaree Energies has solid order book of Rs 60,000 crore in Q3FY26 (vs Rs 50,000 crore in Q3FY25) which gives clear revenue visibility of over next 3-4 years. Moreover, order pipeline remains healthy with 100+ GW of orders under pipeline.\n\nThe company plans to backward integrate its process by installing 10 GW of Ingot wafers in India which is likely to be commissioned by FY27. Additionally, it plans to expand its existing capacity by installing 5.6 GW (3 GW in India & 2.6 GW in USA) of module capacity & 10 GW in India of cell capacity which is also likely to be commissioned by FY27. With this additional capacity, the company's total capacity would reach 28.4 GW/15.4 GW/10GW in Module/Cell/Ingot wafers by FY27.\n\nThe company planned to foray in different line of business, such as Polysilicon/ inverters/smart meters/transformers/BESS/Electrolyser/Green Hydrogen/RE-power infrastructure. The total capex planned is Rs 25,000 crore.\n\nThe company has guided Rs 5,500-6,000 crore of EBITDA for FY26. The company aims to overachieve its guidance (9MFY26 EBITDA stands at Rs 4,330 crore) in FY26.\n\nTD Power Systems| Target: Rs 911\n\nTD Power Systems, a leading supplier of sub-60MW AC generators, occupies a strategic spot in power-generation supply chain. Its output, used by turbine-OEMs and EPC players worldwide, makes it a go-to for decentralised power systems, renewables, waste-to-energy, industrial captive generation and AI/data centre infrastructure boom.\n\nTD Power Systems leverages its strong engineering capabilities to deliver customised generator-motor solutions attuned to decarbonisation and grid-modernisation trends. Its upcoming ~0.22msf manufacturing unit in Bengaluru (Rs 120 crore capex), slated for commissioning by Q4FY26, will support scale-up, product diversification.\n\nWith presence in 111 nations and exports accounting for 76% of H1FY26 order wins, TD Power Systems has deep relationship with global OEMs. Its diversified end-market exposure spans renewables, industrial cogeneration, heavy industries (sugar, cement and chemicals, etc.) and data centre that reinforces long-term growth.\n\nOrder inflows grew ~60% YoY to Rs 656.1 crore, driven primarily by a sharp uptick in export orders. The company successfully secured large US contracts despite tariff headwinds, underscoring its strong competitive positioning and product acceptance in global markets. Management has revised its revenue guidance upwards, with FY27 guidance increased to Rs 2,200 crore (from Rs 2,000 crore) and FY26 revenue guided at Rs 1,800 crore, implying ~50% YoY growth.\n\nFor Q3FY26, total revenue stood at Rs 444.9 crore, up 28% YoY, EBIDTA stood at Rs 82.6 crore, up by 33% YoY, PAT came at Rs 55 crore, increased at 24% YoY. Deep engineering capabilities, healthy BS and strong return profile, position TDPS well to capitalise on ongoing capex cycle over the next 3-5 years.",

The big question now: does Budget 2026–27 add “next-layer” relief, or does it mostly fine-tune the system?According to sources cited by CNN-News18, two proposals are being discussed for the new regime: allowing up to Rs 2 lakh deduction on home loan interest (a benefit currently available only in the old regime), and up to Rs 50,000 deduction for medical insurance premiums, potentially meaningful relief as healthcare costs rise. There’s also chatter around lifting the new-regime standard deduction to Rs 1 lakh from Rs 75,000.Meanwhile, the old regime still draws deduction-heavy filers (80C, 80D, home loan interest), even as talk grows about a gradual shift toward a single default system, speculation reflected in a Times of India survey of tax experts. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, too, has pushed for compliance-friendly reforms and clearer surcharge rules.We’ll track every development here, announcements, numbers, expert takeaways, and the clauses that actually decide what your take-home pay looks like.

        "full_content": "Equity benchmarks retreated from the previous day’s gains amid consolidation, with the Nifty 50 falling 0.4 percent on profit booking on January 30, as participants turned cautious ahead of the Union Budget on February 1. Market breadth was positive, with about 1,661 shares advancing against 1,238 declining shares on the NSE. The market is expected to remain range-bound with an elevated VIX. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:\n\nRajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities\n\nOn the weekly chart, Oil India has staged a major breakout above the multiple resistance zone around Rs 490, following a period of consolidation. The breakout is reinforced by a sharp surge in trading volumes, signalling strong buying interest.\n\nThe expansion of the weekly Bollinger Bands indicates that the stock is entering a high-momentum phase, while the weekly RSI (14) is trading above 70, confirming strong upward momentum. Additionally, the RSI has crossed above its horizontal resistance at 60, further validating the breakout and underscoring the bullish bias.\n\nOn the weekly chart, Bajaj Auto is trending within a rising channel, recently finding support at the lower band and now moving toward the upper band. It has also surpassed a key horizontal supply zone in the Rs 9,300–9,400 range, signalling further strength. The stock is comfortably trading above its 20-, 50-, and 200-day SMAs, confirming a robust primary bullish trend.\n\nThe weekly upward structure, along with the expanding upper Bollinger Band, points to a gradual upside continuation. Additionally, the weekly RSI is trending higher and holding above its reference line, reinforcing a positive bias.\n\nUnion Bank of India| CMP: Rs 180.76\n\nOn the weekly chart, Union Bank of India has staged a decisive breakout above the medium-term horizontal resistance at Rs 173, supported by a notable surge in trading volumes, signalling strong accumulation. The stock is firmly positioned above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMAs, confirming a robust primary uptrend.\n\nThe weekly RSI (14) is trending in the bullish zone around 70, reflecting strong momentum while remaining below extreme overbought levels, thereby reinforcing the positive outlook.\n\nOsho Krishan, Chief Manager - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One\n\nAstra Microwave Products| CMP: Rs 982.6\n\nAstra Microwave Products has experienced a substantial rebound from the previous swing low in the Rs 865 sub-zones over the last couple of trading weeks. The technical structure has turned positive, with a positive crossover seen in the MACD histogram around the zero line, which has propelled the stock above the cluster of its short- and medium-term EMAs.\n\nAdditionally, the double-bottom formation adds to the bullish quotient, suggesting continued growth potential in the near term. Hence, buying Astra Microwave Products around Rs 970–960 is recommended.\n\nCG Power and Industrial Solutions| CMP: Rs 584\n\nCG Power has undergone a corrective phase of over 30 percent from its recent high of Rs 800 sub-levels and plunged below all its major EMAs to re-test the previous swing low around the Rs 520 sub-zones. However, the recent traction from the support zone and oversold territory portrays an early signal of reversal in the near term.\n\nAlso, the 14-week RSI and MACD histograms are aligned with the pullback momentum in the stock, suggesting a strong risk–reward ratio. Hence, buying CG Power around Rs 580–570 is recommended.\n\nOil and Natural Gas Corporation| CMP: Rs 269\n\nONGC has demonstrated a substantial consolidation breakout after an elongated period, propelling the stock above all its significant EMAs and indicating a bullish bias. Additionally, the SuperTrend has turned bullish, signalling a buy, and the accompanying volume spurt has added conviction.\n\nThe technical indicators are strongly aligned with price momentum, indicating a bullish outlook for the near term. Hence, buying ONGC on dips around Rs 260 is recommended.\n\nAnshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments\n\nUjjivan Small Finance Bank| CMP: Rs 65.37\n\nUjjivan Small Finance Bank has delivered a decisive breakout from a massive 318-week IPO base near Rs 60, marking a major long-term structural shift. The stock has now sustained above the breakout level for three consecutive weeks, confirming acceptance and reducing the risk of a false move.\n\nThe price structure across timeframes is constructive, with daily, weekly, and monthly moving averages tightly aligned and rising, acting as a strong launchpad on dips. Momentum indicators remain supportive, and volume behaviour suggests steady institutional participation rather than speculative churn.\n\nAny retracement back toward the Rs 60 breakout zone offers a favourable risk–reward opportunity to add long positions. As long as this level holds on a closing basis, the stock is well positioned for an upside extension toward the Rs 75 zone in the near to medium term.\n\nLupin is on the verge of resolving a major 50-week rectangle on the weekly chart, with the upper boundary placed near Rs 2,180. The right side of the structure has tightened sharply, with volumes drying up—a classic precursor to an expansion move. This contraction suggests supply exhaustion rather than distribution.\n\nMoving averages across timeframes have flattened and are beginning to turn up, while momentum indicators are transitioning from neutral toward a bullish trajectory. Price acceptance near the range high keeps the setup constructive.\n\nA clean breakout and sustained move above Rs 2,180 would confirm pattern resolution and is likely to trigger a swift move toward the Rs 2,400 zone. Risk–reward favours the upside at this inflection point, with failure to break out likely leading only to further consolidation rather than an immediate breakdown.",

        "full_content": "The economic survey pegs the India’s GDP growth between 6.8-7.2% for the FY 2026/27 and indicates momentum across services, and manufacturing using high-frequency data points. Economic survey does an excellent job in using data-driven economic analysis to explore important relationships such as the impact of exchange rates or PLI-Schemes on exports or India’s debt sustainability analysis. The economic survey is also bold where it needs to be, for example highlighting the worsening of state’s fiscal math. But what stands out even more is the economic survey’s focus on how deregulation-easing up of laws and processes-a term it uses 35 times in the survey- can fuel India’s long-term growth, resonating with much of the recent academic research.\n\nEconomic survey highlights two challenges to the state’s fiscal balances: First is the doubling of number of states since FY23 providing “Unconditional cash Transfers” (UCT), and second is the falling revenue receipts as a % of GDP from 13.3% in FY19 to 12.2% in FY25, constraining fiscal space further. The combined debt of central and state government now stands at 81%, higher than 73% for emerging markets.\n\nMore worryingly, the fiscal situation in states with larger than expected state bond issuances is spilling over to the central government yields which have hardened and are hovering around 6.65% despite the RBI cutting rates by 125 basis points over 2025, and despite the central government likely to adhere to the fiscal target. The interest repayment is 30% of government’s revenue expenditure and higher cost of borrowing implies even larger share of interest payments eating up government’s budget. But higher yields on GSec are also limiting monetary policy transmission for private sector, constraining CAPEX.\n\nThe Economic survey points to many interesting nudges and small initiatives which are having large impact: One example is NUDGE experiment by tax officials improving tax compliance, or JIT system for scheme-related cash outlays implemented by the government which reduces the idle cash balance from Rs 1.67 lakh crore to Rs 0.4 lakh crore over the past 18 months.\n\nMore generally, the economic survey pushes strongly for reforms and deregulation led growth. Economists highlight rigid labour codes and slow and inefficient liquidation laws as the two main challenges to India’s scaling-up problem, exactly the issues the survey stresses on. The seminal research by Chang-Tai Hsieh and Peter Klenow estimate in their 2009 paper published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics that a mere reallocation of capital from low to high productivity plants/firms can raise India’s productivity by 40-60%. India has capital with Capital stock to GDP ratio of around 4X for India relative to 3.15X for the USA as per the latest PennWorld tables. The problem is that due to “misallocation of capital”, our labour productivity is 10X lower to that of the USA.\n\nThe rigid labour laws in India which have historically constrained the ability of the businesses to downsize, actually make them fearful to scale-up the employment and leads them to employ suboptimal contract workers. The result is that while average US establishment grows its workforce by 8X over a 35-year life cycle, Indian plants grow it by a factor of 1.4, even lower compared to Mexico’s 2.5. The new labour codes allowing more flexibility in downsizing as well improving safety net to the workers shall go a long way in helping firm scale-up as well as reduce the incidence of contract workers, which typically drag the productivity down.\n\nThe difficulties in liquidation- both stretched timelines and lower recovery rates as highlighted by the survey, despite implementation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Codes (IBC) stifle firm exits and leads to low entry rates and lower innovation than potential. Indian firm exit rates are one of the lowest in the world (around 3.1% as per recent estimates by Chatterjee et al (2025), and even lower than 1% as per the IMF), which means limited market space and capital for newer entrants, dragging productivity down.\n\nThe examples of misallocation of capital are a plenty in India: For example, consumerloansshare rising to 34% now while share of Industrial loan share falling to 21%, pointing to “premature Industrialization”- a term coined by economist Dani Rodrick. Even within industry, quality of loans is poor with 57% of the loans being working capital as per the RBI’s FSR released in December-2025, and worse is the perverted trade credit system where smaller firms take longer to realize their sales receivables compared to larger firms implying that smaller firms essentially finance larger firms in trade credit market.\n\nThe “Viksit Bharat” mission needs India to correct these misallocations, and recent labour reforms, adding up of IBC courts, UPI revolution that is deepening credit access to productive small businesses through QR code technology, all go in the right direction. The Economic Survey is spot on to address these issues and setting up a stage for next-decadal growth for India.",

        "full_content": "Small & mid caps enter Union Budget 2026 from a tougher base than the ‘easy rerating’ phase of the last cycle, when liquidity and optimism helped compress risk premiums. Today, markets are far more sensitive to earnings certainty, cash flow conversion, and balance sheet strength. This means Budget 2026 must focus less on headline announcements and more on execution levers that improve profitability, reduce financing stress, and lower the cost of capital for India Inc.\n\n1)Capex continuity matters but delivery and transmission matter more\n\nA core expectation is that the government stays committed to public capex, with estimates of a ~10-15% increase. This matters because small & mid-caps benefit most when capex creates a multi-year order cycle, not just a one year push. Contextually, FY26 capex outlay was set at Rs 11.21 lakh crore.\n\nHowever, FY25 capex spend was around Rs 10.18 lakh crore versus a Budget Estimate of Rs 11.11 lakh crore, showing that the ‘budgeted vs delivered’ gap can dilute market confidence.\n\nFor midcap Industrials, Capital Goods, and EPC supply chains, what matters most is project awarding pace, payment discipline, and stable pipelines across Railways, roads, power T&D, and urban upgrades. A critical but underappreciated lever is state led capex, because smaller companies often participate as regional suppliers and contractors.\n\nBudget 2026 must narrow the delivery gap because execution discipline, not just allocation, will define whether capex translates into sustained mid/small cap earnings.\n\n2)Defence, Manufacturing & AI: Shift From 'Theme' To Scalable Execution\n\nBudget expectations again highlight defence and manufacturing, which remains highly relevant for midcap industrials and niche suppliers. But the market will increasingly reward companies that show execution, profitability, and working capital discipline, not just ‘theme positioning’ A capex heavy Budget stance (rail/logistics/defence procurement/industrial build outs) improves the probability of long duration ordering for vendors and ancillaries typically where mid & small caps compound.\n\nBudget support for AI adoption in manufacturing, defence tech (surveillance, autonomous systems, cybersecurity), and skilling/digital infrastructure can raise productivity, reduce turnaround times, and improve asset utilization directly supporting margins and cash conversion across supply chains.\n\n3)Conclusion: Budget 2026 must convert ‘rerating’ into ‘re-earning’\n\nBudget linked alpha in small & mid caps will likely come from areas where capex visibility + balance sheet strength + cash conversion align, rather than from ‘theme only’ narratives. If Budget 2026 sustains a 10-15% capex growth bias with continued focus on railways, infrastructure and manufacturing multipliers, midcap capital goods, EPC ancillaries, rail linked vendors, logistics enablers, and select building material plays could see earnings upgrades from faster order awarding and execution momentum.\n\nThe ‘crowded trade’ risk is highest in segments that already reflect peak optimism, stocks that rerated sharply without commensurate cash flows may struggle if private capex remains uneven. Net net, the best Budget outcomes for small & mid caps will likely reward execution compounders over narrative momentum.\n\nSmall & mid caps will not sustain leadership in 2026 if returns depend on multiple expansion alone.\n\nUnion Budget 2026 needs to get three big things right:\n\n* Keep public capex strong but execution heavy,\n\n* Broaden private capex participation beyond a few sectors, and\n\n* Support consumption and MSMEs without compromising fiscal discipline.\n\nIf the Budget delivers this mix, along with stable tax policy, improved working capital, and sectoral pipelines in defence/railways/infra, small & mid caps can shift from a volatile post rerating phase into a healthier earnings compounding cycle.",

        "full_content": "The Union Budget 2026 comes at a critical juncture. We're navigating some real headwinds as corporate earnings have been sluggish, nominal GDP growth has taken a marginal hit, and tax revenues haven't kept pace with expectations. Adding fuel to the fire are the geopolitical complexities we're witnessing, such as the US tariff measures, gold prices climbing, and the resulting depreciation of the Rupee.\n\nAgainst this challenging backdrop, the Budget has its job cut out. It needs to reignite the domestic growth engine. It needs to find a delicate balance between fiscal discipline and strategic government borrowing. And it needs to provide targeted support for both capital expenditure and consumption.\n\nWhen it comes to government spending, we believe the FY26 capex estimate of Rs 11 lakh crore may be difficult to achieve. With the increased focus on fiscal consolidation, we're expecting Capex growth to track roughly in line or slightly higher than nominal GDP growth. There is likely to be an increased allocation towards defence capex, given the geopolitical environment we're operating in. We expect the overall Capex/GDP to be steady around 3-3.1% of GDP for FY27, not unlike FY26, indicating disciplined, rather than aggressive expansion.\n\nIn terms of fiscal realities, we're expecting a shortfall in tax revenue. But with the government taking a disciplined approach by trimming subsidies and being more calibrated with capex spending, the FY26 fiscal deficit target of 4.4% of GDP should be achievable.\n\nFor the longer term, the government will aim to bring the debt-to-GDP ratio down to around 50% by FY31, a clear indication of fiscal consolidation. For FY27, we're expecting the fiscal deficit to hold in the 4.3-4.4% range—essentially flat versus FY26.\n\nThe Budget needs to support both capex and consumption without making any dramatic cuts to capex below a critical 3% of GDP threshold, to avoid growth hindrances. There is likely to be renewed emphasis on job creation, rural demand and sustainable development to propel the country toward a $5 trillion economy.\n\nWhen it comes to market expectations our view is measured. Investors should focus on policy continuity and stability. The finance ministry will endeavour to avoid any disruptive tax moves that could rattle sentiment or strain the fiscal framework. Budget day volatility would be something to watch out for. If stimuli fall short or fiscal targets slip, it could potentially raise bond yields and tighten liquidity.\n\nIn terms of sectors to track, we have identified a few potential ones such as:\n\nDefence: We see a potential double-digit allocation for defence capital expenditure to drive modernisation, R&D and indigenous manufacturing with a focus on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)/Drone tech, Air Defence & Anti-drone systems.\n\nRailways: The Indian Railways is expected to receive a boost in Capex to accelerate infrastructure modernization, with a major focus on safety (Kavach: Train Collision Avoidance System) and capacity augmentation.\n\nNBFC-MFI:A larger Credit guarantee scheme is on the cards for NBFC-MFIs to help them raise funds and lend to low-income borrowers, specially in underserved markets and alleviate asset quality.\n\nFertilisers:A potential increase in subsidy of Rs 1.7 – 2.0 lakh crore will help combat higher raw material prices and push indigenous production.\n\nAffordable housing: There is a strong thrust to redefine \"affordable housing\" to align with current market prices and increase the price cap from Rs 45 lakh to Rs 65–90 lakh in metros, allowing more projects to qualify for the 1% GST rate.\n\nPrecious metals: A potential import duty on precious metals, may benefit Gold lending NBFCs which may prove to be favourable investment avenues.\n\nBesides, the government is also likely to work on initiatives to shield exporters in sectors like Textiles, Engineering, Auto Ancillaries, and Chemicals to combat the likely impact from high tariffs imposed by the US. We believe key incentives for affected sectors like targeted duty rationalisation, expansion of PLI Schemes, Green Manufacturing incentives like tax breaks for adopting Green energy; and a thrust for market diversification to alternative, low-duty markets will be the strategic way forward and build our resilience in this shifting global landscape.",

Both resignations will take effect from April 1, 2026.\n\nThe company said in a statement said,\" The exits are part of Delhivery’s previously announced board rejuvenation exercise, aimed at aligning the company’s governance structure with its next phase of growth.\" \"\n\nAs part of this transition, Delhivery had inducted new independent directors in 2025, including Namita Thapar, Whole-time Director at Emcure Pharmaceuticals; Sameer Mehta, Co-founder and Executive Director of boAt Lifestyle; Yashish Dahiya, Chairman, Executive Director and CEO of PB Fintech; and Dr Padmini Srinivasan, faculty member at IIM Bangalore,\" the statement further added.\n\nDeepak Kapoor joined Delhivery’s board in 2017, while Saugata Gupta came on board in 2021. Both played a key role in steering the company through its initial public offering in 2022 and its evolution as a listed entity thereafter.\n\nSahil Barua, MD & CEO of Delhivery, said, “Deepak served as Chairman of our Board for over 8 years and was instrumental in helping us set up high quality governance, board processes, appropriate financial systems and controls and internal audit processes. Saugata played a large role as Chairperson of our NRC, helping us benchmark and institutionalise HR processes and metrics and hone our recruitment and retention strategy for high quality talent.”\n\nBarua added, “More importantly, Deepak and Saugata have been instrumental in our process of recognising the need for and enabling the reconstitution of the Board of Directors in line with our ambitious next phase of growth. On behalf of the entire Delhivery team, we are deeply thankful to both for their counsel and support.”\n\nThe company said the planned board changes underscore its focus on strengthening governance while preparing for long-term, scalable growth as a public company.\n\nMeanwhile, Delhivery swung back into the black in the third quarter of FY26, reporting a profit of Rs 39.6 crore, marking a steady improvement from a profit of Rs 25 crore in the same period last year and a sharp turnaround from the Rs 50.5 crore loss posted in the previous quarter.\n\nThe Gurugram-based company delivered its strongest operating performance yet, with EBITDA surging 227 percent year-on-year to Rs 147 crore. The EBITDA margin expanded to 5.3 percent, the highest in Delhivery’s history and already matching the EBITDA generated in the entire FY25.\n\nRevenue from operations climbed nearly 18 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,805 crore in the December quarter, compared with Rs 2,378 crore a year earlier. On a sequential basis, revenue also improved from Rs 2,559.3 crore in Q2 FY26, reflecting sustained momentum across core businesses.\n\nTotal expenses rose 15 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,820 crore, driven by higher volumes and network activity, compared with Rs 2,450.9 crore in the year-ago quarter and Rs 2,708.1 crore in the preceding quarter.\n\nDelhivery’s express parcel business delivered a standout performance during the festive season, with shipments jumping 43 percent year-on-year to a record 295 million parcels. The company said this was one of its strongest peak seasons to date, aided by market share gains, higher wallet share from large clients, and improved utilisation across its logistics network.\n\nThe part truckload (PTL) segment also crossed a major milestone, with throughput exceeding 500,000 metric tonnes for the first time. PTL volumes grew 23 percent year-on-year, even as service quality and delivery precision remained stable despite heavier network loads—an area that has traditionally weighed on margins in the logistics sector.\n\nThese operating gains translated into a sharp improvement in profitability. Delhivery crossed Rs 1,000 crore in service EBITDA at a full-year level for the first time. Service EBITDA margins in its transport businesses—express and PTL—rose to 16.4 percent in Q3 FY26, up from 12.8 percent a year ago and 13.5 percent in the September quarter.\n\nAlongside its financial turnaround, Delhivery expanded its growth initiatives. The company extended its on-demand logistics platform, Delhivery Direct, to Mumbai and Hyderabad, adding to its presence in NCR, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad. It also launched Delhivery International, an economy air-parcel service aimed at making exports more affordable for Indian small and medium enterprises.\n\nShares of Delhivery closed 2.61 percent higher at ₹422.50 on the BSE on January 30, reflecting positive investor sentiment following the strong quarterly performance.",

        "full_content": "The year 2026 has begun on a volatile note for precious metals, with gold and silver hitting record highs before witnessing a sharp sell-off on Friday, unsettling global and Indian investors alike.\n\nGold prices surged past $5,500 per ounce for the first time on Thursday, well above previous peaks, as investors flocked to safe-haven assets. However, by the end of Friday’s session, the metal had retreated sharply to around $5,068 per ounce.\n\nSilver saw even more dramatic moves. Prices crossed $120 per ounce last week — one of the strongest rallies in decades — before tumbling to $98.50 on Friday.\n\nThe rally in gold has been driven by rising geopolitical tensions, trade war threats, uncertainty over the direction of interest rates, and fears of a changing global economic order. Central banks across the world have also been buying gold aggressively, reinforcing its role as a store of value during periods of uncertainty. Retail participation has risen alongside prices, particularly through gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which offer easier access without holding physical bullion.\n\nFriday’s sharp correction in both gold and silver was triggered by global market reactions following US President Donald Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next chair of the US Federal Reserve. Given the Fed’s central role in global financial stability, the prospect of a more hawkish policy stance unsettled markets. The sell-off was further amplified by a stronger US dollar, rising bond yields and profit-booking after a sharp rally.\n\nSilver’s surge has been fuelled not just by safe-haven demand but also by its growing industrial importance. The metal is critical for clean energy technologies such as solar panels, electric vehicles and semiconductors. Each solar panel contains about 20 grams of silver, with the solar industry accounting for nearly 30 per cent of global demand. EVs require 25–50 grams per vehicle, while AI data centres are boosting demand through semiconductor usage.\n\nAdding to the pressure is a persistent supply crunch. The silver market has been in deficit for five consecutive years, with consumption exceeding mining output. Since most silver is produced as a byproduct of other metals, supply cannot be quickly increased..\n\nMarket experts say the correction reflects profit-taking rather than a breakdown in fundamentals.\n\nPranav Koomar, Founder and CEO of PlusCash, said, “Today’s sharp fall in gold and silver prices can be explained as a classic bout of profit-booking after an extended record rally and not as a breakdown in fundamental sentiments. In this regard, while high positioning, strong dollar movements, and an uptick in bond yields have contributed to a correction in gold prices, from a medium- to a long-term perspective, the prices have continued to find support due to global uncertainty, buying from Central Banks, and tight supply dynamics. Any fall seems to be a buying opportunity and not a sign of any change in the trend.”\n\nHareesh V, Head of Commodity Research at Geojit Investments Limited, noted, “Silver prices are surging to record highs due to a powerful combination of geopolitical shocks, supply deficits, and a shift toward safe-haven assets… However, historically silver is very volatile, hence a steep correction cannot be ruled out at any time.” He added that technical indicators suggest the market is overbought and that easing geopolitical risks, a stronger dollar or improved mine output could pull prices lower.\n\nNikunj Saraf, CEO of Choice Wealth, pointed to the impact on Indian markets, saying, “The 14% plunge in Gold and Silver ETFs isn’t mysterious—it’s classic profit-taking after Thursday’s record highs on MCX… For investors: This dip tests conviction—diversify, avoid panic selling, and eye rebounds from central bank demand. Long-term bulls hold firm.”\n\nManeesh Sharma, AVP – Commodities & Currencies at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers, said the sharp moves also reflected global equity weakness, speculation over the Fed leadership, and uncertainty around US monetary policy. He added that markets will now watch upcoming US labour data and India’s Union Budget, noting that “any signs of changes in import duty structure could reflect directly into MCX prices,” and that volatility with a corrective bias may persist in the near term.\n\nExperts caution that while precious metals remain important portfolio diversifiers, their sharp swings highlight the risks of chasing rallies. With no interest or dividend income and heightened volatility — particularly in silver — advisers continue to recommend moderation, discipline and diversification for everyday investors.",

Our innovative product offering has expanded further with the launch of Unloxcyt in the US and the introduction of Ilumya in India.”\n\nSun Pharma shares ended the previous trading session 0.4 per cent higher at Rs 1,595 apiece, though the stock has declined 7.3 per cent over the past month.",

        "full_content": "As Budget 2026 approaches, India’s crypto industry is urging the government to revisit the tax framework introduced in 2022.\n\nIndustry players argue that the 1 percent TDS and flat 30 percent tax on gains have curtailed domestic trading, pushed users offshore, and dampened innovation.\n\nThey are seeking simpler taxation, loss set-offs, and clearer rules to revive participation and ensure sustainable growth.\n\nCut in TDS on crypto transactions\n\nCurrently, there is a 1 percent Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on every transaction, which locks up the capital of traders. The industry proposes to reduce the TDS rate to 0.01 percent on cryptocurrency and virtual digital assets.\n\n“The industry proposes a reduction of TDS rate to 0.01 percent, which would strike a balance between effective transaction tracking and promoting the growth of the domestic crypto market,” said Nischal Shetty, Founder of WazirX.\n\nThe Centre imposed a 1 percent TDS on all crypto and virtual digital asset transactions from July 1, 2022, following the Budget 2022 announcement. Introduced under Section 194S of the Income Tax Act, the rule mandates buyers to deduct 1 percent tax on each transaction, which exchanges then remit to the government.\n\nEdul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, explains that the 1 percent TDS on crypto and VDA transactions has pushed trading activity to offshore platforms, reducing visibility and participation within the domestic ecosystem.\n\n“Reducing TDS to 0.01 percent and allowing loss offsetting would ease friction for investors, improve transparency, and support the long-term, sustainable growth of India’s crypto industry,\" said Patel.\n\nReview 30 percent flat capital gains tax on VDAs\n\nBudget 2022 imposed a flat 30 percent tax on profits from virtual digital assets, placing crypto income in the same category as winnings from lotteries and gambling. The tax applies uniformly, regardless of holding period.\n\nCrypto experts argue this erodes net returns, particularly for long-term investors who miss out on long-term capital gains benefits available for other asset classes such as mutual funds.\n\nAccording to SB Seker, Head of APAC, Binance, a pragmatic framework focused on capital gains realised, with provisions for limited loss set‑off and removal on transaction‑level levies in favour of net-revenue generating corporate taxes instead, can improve fairness for retail participants and indicate to them India has moved past the tax-and-deter regime towards a fuller license-and-supervise one.\n\n\"The steep taxation of 30 percent on crypto gains creates a stark disparity in how equities and crypto are treated, affecting the sentiment of users towards one asset class,\" said Shetty.\n\nCrypto industry players are calling for a move away from transaction-level taxes toward net-revenue taxation to allow loss set-offs. They argue that permitting investors to offset losses from one crypto against gains from another would ensure tax is levied only on net profits.\n\nUnder the current framework, losses from virtual digital assets cannot be adjusted against gains from any asset class.\n\n“Disallowing loss set-offs even in the same asset class creates an uneven and asymmetric tax regime,” said Shetty.\n\nBring regulatory clarity for VDAs\n\nThe Centre has time and again made its stance clear that the Indian government does not regulate cryptocurrency. Instead, taxation applies to every crypto activity.\n\nAnalysts say that the underreporting or non-disclosure of crypto assets carries risk, especially at a time when tax authorities are closely tracking crypto activities.\n\nRaj Karkara, COO of ZebPay, expects Budget 2026 to represent an important opportunity to provide regulatory clarity for the crypto sector.\n\n“Clear and well-defined guidelines around the classification, treatment, and oversight of digital assets would significantly strengthen confidence among investors, institutions, and market participants. Greater clarity on both regulation and taxation would also enable businesses to plan responsibly, innovate within defined boundaries, and deepen onshore participation,” said Karkara.",

        "full_content": "As the Union Finance Minister prepares to present the Budget for FY 2026–27 on February 1, expectations are running high among individual taxpayers. As the government seeks to balance fiscal consolidation with growth, the middle class hopes for reforms that ease compliance, reduce tax burdens, and encourage savings and investment.\n\nPersonal tax relief: Rates, slabs, and surcharges\n\nOne of the most pressing demands is a reduction in personal income tax rates, particularly for those earning up to Rs 15 lakh annually. Taxpayers are looking for rationalisation of tax slabs under both the old and new regimes, along with an increase in the basic exemption limit to provide meaningful relief. Such measures would not only reduce tax outgo but also lower compliance costs by reducing the obligation to file returns for smaller taxpayers. For high-income earners, a reduction in surcharge rates is equally important to bring down the maximum marginal tax rate, which currently feels punitive.\n\nMaking the new tax regime more attractive\n\nThe new tax regime, though simplified, still lacks the appeal of the old regime because of limited deductions. Taxpayers expect the government to make it more attractive by introducing progressive standard deductions for salaried individuals and allowing essential deductions for health insurance, home loan interest, and life insurance. These changes would create parity between salaried and non-salaried individuals and make the regime more inclusive.\n\nSimplifying compliance for property transactions\n\nCompliance simplification is another area where reforms are overdue. When a property seller is a resident, the TDS process is simple and can be completed using a single challan-cum-statement in Form 26QB. However, when the seller is an NRI, the process becomes cumbersome. Taxes are withheld at higher rates, and the buyer must obtain a TAN and file e-TDS returns after depositing the tax. Since property transactions are usually one-time events, obtaining a TAN solely for this purpose often results in numerous inactive TANs. Introducing a mechanism similar to that for resident sellers would significantly ease this burden.\n\nAdvance tax and overseas payment challenges\n\nAnother expectation towards ease of compliance is an increase in the threshold for advance tax compliance. Currently, taxpayers must pay advance tax if their annual liability exceeds Rs 10,000. Raising this limit to Rs 50,000 would reduce the compliance burden for small taxpayers and allow them to focus on their core financial priorities.\n\nSimilarly, tax payments and refunds through overseas bank accounts should be allowed for NRIs and others living abroad. Taxpayers without Indian bank accounts often face challenges in paying taxes or receiving refunds, as payments can currently be made only through Indian banking channels such as NEFT, RTGS, net banking, or UPI.\n\nPromoting sustainability through tax policy\n\nTax policy changes that promote sustainability are also on the radar. Under Rule 3(2) of the Income Tax Rules, the valuation of perquisites for employer-provided motor cars is based on engine capacity, which applies only to conventional fuel vehicles. There is no specific provision for electric or hybrid cars. Amending this rule to include battery capacity as a valuation criterion would bring much-needed clarity.\n\nAdditionally, reinstating the deduction for interest paid onloansfor electric vehicles under Section 80EEB, with a higher limit of Rs 2,00,000, would encourage wider adoption of green mobility.\n\nReducing litigation and improving certainty\n\nFinally, taxpayers are seeking measures to reduce litigation and improve certainty. Automated systems have led to a surge in notices triggered by minor mismatches between AIS, TDS records, and returns. Introducing materiality thresholds and stronger reconciliation mechanisms would prevent unnecessary scrutiny. Strengthening the appellate process and ensuring timely disposal of pending appeals would also help restore confidence in the system.\n\nAs Budget 2026 approaches, the middle class hopes for reforms that address rising costs of housing, healthcare, and education while simplifying compliance and reducing litigation. A budget that delivers clarity, fairness, and convenience will not only ease taxpayer hardships but also strengthen trust in India’s tax system.",

        "full_content": "In the Union Budget 2026, to be presented on February 1, the insurance industry hopes for a hike in tax deductions, extension of tax benefits to the new tax regime for both health and life policies, and a resolution of the input tax credit (ITC) on GST.\n\nThe industry believes these measures would motivate households to move beyond minimal coverage and adopt adequate insurance protection. It also expects tax parity for annuity and pension products, while resolving the GST input tax credit anomaly could reduce operating costs for insurers and help contain premiums, ultimately improving affordability and long-term financial security for policyholders.\n\nCurrently, the old tax regime allows a deduction of up to Rs 25,000 for individuals and families below 60 years of age and Rs 50,000 for senior citizens under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act.\n\nSubrata Mondal, Managing Director & CEO of IFFCO-TOKIO General Insurance, argues that these limits no longer reflect rising medical inflation. “Doubling the deduction would encourage households to opt for adequate protection rather than minimal coverage and support long-term financial security.”\n\nTax analysts, on the other hand, say that the deduction should also be extended to individuals opting for the new tax regime. “Extending deduction benefits to the new tax regime will ensure that the pursuit of a simpler tax code does not inadvertently discourage essential health coverage,” said Shravanth Shanker, Managing Partner, B. Shanker Advocates.\n\nExtend life insurance tax deduction benefits to the new tax regime\n\nThe Income Tax Act provides tax benefits for life insurance premiums and proceeds received upon maturity or upon the insured's death. Section 80C allows a tax benefit of up to Rs 1.5 lakh on premiums, and a tax-free payout under Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act. However, these benefits apply only under the old tax regime.\n\n“Rationalising income-tax deductions for life insurance premiums under both old and new tax regimes, expanding the threshold for taxing high-value policy payouts, and ensuring tax parity for annuity and pension products could bolster long-term retirement planning,” said Vipin Upadhyay, Partner, King Stubb & Kasiva, Advocates and Attorneys.\n\nTax analysts say that the introduction of distinct tax deductions for term life insurance premiums can be modelled on the additional deductions available for pension savings under the National Pension System (NPS).\n\n“Experts are also pressing for consistent tax treatment of life insurance gain outcomes, noting that traditional policies with higher annual premiums face less favourable tax rules compared with unit-linked contracts,” said Rajarshi Dasgupta, Executive Director (Tax), Aquilaw.\n\nAddress Input Tax Credit anomaly\n\nThe industry is also seeking a resolution to the input tax credit (ITC) on goods and services tax (GST). ITC allows businesses to offset taxes paid on purchases, and insurers say its non-availability significantly increases costs and impacts profitability from policies.\n\nAlthough GST exemptions on retail life and health insurance have eased costs for policyholders, insurers remain unable to claim input tax credits on critical services such as distribution, customer support, and technology.\n\n“These unrecoverable expenses elevate operating costs and eventually translate into higher premiums. The industry is urging the government to introduce a more flexible input credit framework and undertake broader GST rationalisation in Budget 2026 to contain cost escalation,” said Parimal Heda, Chief Investment Officer, Go Digit General Insurance.",

However, on a monthly basis, both indices declined 3 percent each.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) turned buyers on Friday, purchasing equities worth Rs 2,251 crore. However, they remained net sellers for the week, having offloaded shares worth Rs 730 crore. Meanwhile, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) continued their support, buying equities worth Rs 14,398.03 crore.\n\nAmong sectors, the Nifty Defence index outperformed with a nearly 9 percent gain, followed by Nifty Energy, which rose 6 percent. The Nifty Oil & Gas index added 4 percent, while Nifty Realty and Metal indices climbed 3 percent each. On the other hand, the Nifty IT, FMCG, and Healthcare indices declined by 0.5 percent each.\n\n\"Indian equities traded in a volatile yet cautiously constructive tone during the week, shaped by domestic policy expectations and evolving global cues. Initially sentiment was subdued due to renewed tariff-related concerns and mixed corporate earnings, although optimism surrounding the India–EU trade agreement lent support, particularly to trade-oriented sectors. Select pockets of weakness were observed in Autos and Beverages amid intensifying competitive pressures,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments.\n\n\"Market sentiment improved mid-week following a favourable economic survey that reinforced expectations of robust FY27 growth and a benign inflation outlook. However, risk appetite weakened toward the end of the week ahead of the Union Budget, with volatility resurfacing amid FII outflows and rupee depreciation. Profit booking intensified in Metals and IT amid a firmer dollar and global liquidity concerns, with sentiment turning cautious ahead of clarity on the incoming Fed Chair. Markets remain wary that a potentially stronger inflation focus could prolong tight financial conditions and weigh on emerging markets.\"\n\n\"Looking ahead, markets are expected to remain largely event-driven, with the Union Budget acting as the key domestic trigger. Expectations are balanced between growth support and fiscal prudence. Cyclical sectors may continue to show relative resilience if supported by policy measures, while IT and export-oriented stocks are likely to remain sensitive to global macro cues,\" Nair added.\n\n\"Overall, markets are expected to stay range-bound, underpinned by strong domestic fundamentals but constrained by external uncertainties, including geopolitical risks, global tariff developments, and the U.S. Fed’s evolving policy outlook,\" he said further.\n\nThe BSE Small-cap index jumped 3 percent, led by sharp gains in Sharda Cropchem, Hindustan Copper, MIC Electronics, SPEL Semiconductor, Panorama Studios International, JITF Infralogistics, Mahindra Logistics, Moschip Technologies, Walchandnagar Industries, Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers, Manorama Industries, MTAR Technologies, Data Patterns (India), Punjab Chemicals & Crop Protection, Sterlite Technologies, and Taneja Aerospace and Aviation, all of which surged more than 20 percent each.\n\nMeanwhile, Vimta Labs, Sri Adhikari Brothers Television, OneSource Specialty Pharma, IFB Industries, South Indian Bank, SBFC Finance, and Best Agrolife declined over 15 percent.\n\nSudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities\n\nGoing ahead, the immediate resistance for Nifty is placed in the 25,450–25,500 zone, with the Index failing to decisively close above this zone after attempting twice in the last six sessions. A decisive breakout above this zone could result in Nifty extending its pullback towards 25,650, followed by 25,800 in the near term. On the downside, the 200-day EMA zone of 25,200–25,150 zone is likely to act as a strong support.\n\nAjit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking\n\nOur view on the Nifty remains unchanged. Sustenance above the 25,350 level could result in a further rebound towards the 25,600 zone, while a decisive break below the long-term moving average, the 200 DEMA around 25,150, may derail the recovery and drag the index towards the 24,750–24,900 zone. With all eyes on the Union Budget, we expect heightened volatility during the special trading session on Sunday and suggest preferring a hedged approach.\n\nNagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities\n\nTechnically, this market action indicates a consolidation movement in Nifty near the crucial resistance. The market is awaiting a fresh direction from the key economic event of Union Budget 2026 which will be presented in the Parliament on Sunday-1st Feb. Hence the outcome of this event could open fresh moves in the marketon on either side. Immediate support is placed at 25200 and a sustainable upmove above 25450-25500 levels could possibly open sharp upside ahead.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "The Union Budget 2026, to be presented on February 1, comes at a time when commodity markets are going through a volatile phase. Investors and industry participants will be closely tracking policy announcements that could have a bearing on prices, costs and taxation across key commodities.\n\nWhile commodities are influenced largely by global factors such as interest rates, geopolitical developments and supply dynamics, domestic policy decisions ranging from GST and import duties to excise structures play an important role in shaping market sentiment and pricing trends in India.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Budget 2026 assumes significance for the commodity space, particularly for segments such as precious metals, base metals and energy products, which have seen sharp price movements in recent months. Any tweaks in taxation or duty structures could influence cost structures for industries and, eventually, prices paid by consumers.\n\nThe timing is crucial as the market braces for fresh volatility in an already volatile commodity sector.  Take prices of gold and silver, for instance —under the precious metals segment— which have surged to historic levels, supplies have tightened, and though investors are booking profits, their shine is gradually becoming dim for many. Similarly, the rise in fuel prices has pinched everyday commuters, influencing fares and access. Overall, affecting one’s personal finances.\n\nTherefore, to understand the health of India’s commodity sector during the Union Budget 2026-27, we measured the top-six performing commodity assets under the bullion and precious metals, base and industrial metals, and energy commodities to watch out for: gold, silver, copper, aluminium, crude oil, and natural gas.\n\nFor this purpose, we’ve recorded their current prices and taxation applied to these commodity segments.\n\nBudget 2026: Commodity prices in focus amid market volatility\n\nPrices of gold, silver, copper, aluminium, crude oil, and natural gas have been significantly volatile, driven by a mix of global macroeconomic, geopolitical, and supply-demand factors.\n\nIn the latest move, prices of top-performing commodities have plunged sharply after hitting record highs. On MCX, gold futures fell nearly 21.88% from Rs 1,92,097 per 10 grams, silver slid 43.89% from Rs 4,02,048, copper dropped 13.23% from Rs 1,480.30, aluminium plunged 48.75% from Rs 361.25 per kilogram, and crude oil declined 3.29% from Rs 6,135 per barrel over the last 24 hours. Natural gas was also down 2.12% from its peak of Rs 391.90 per mmBtu on December 5, 2025.\n\nThe prices of these assets have sharply corrected after the US Fed kept the rates unchanged at 3.5-3.75 percent during the January policy meeting. Traders are now pricing in a further accommodative stance, which has supported their prices. The geopolitical tensions added fuel as US-Iran relations intensified over a nuclear program. The prices are also up amid the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, the crisis in Gaza, Trump’s tariff threats, and the dollar’s strength.\n\nBudget 2026: Commodity taxation in focus\n\nThe GST and import duty structure on major commodities differ as per their form. Gold and silver attract a uniform GST of 3 percent, with import duty set at 6 percent\n\nCopper is taxed under varied GST slabs, typically ranging from 12-28 percent, with basic customs duty reduced to nil on scrap metals and 5 percent on refined copper.\n\nCrude oil continues to remain outside the GST framework and is instead subject to excise duty and state VAT, while import duty varies as per its type. Natural gas is also exempt from GST’s radar, while import duties from some countries have been exempt, while it varies for others, ranging from 2.5-5 percent for liquid nitrogen gas (LNG) and 5 percent for compressed natural gas (CNG).",

        "full_content": "As India prepares for the Union Budget 2026, investors and industry participants are closely watching how the budget might reshape demand for precious metals, particularly silver.\n\nSilver is unique among commodities: it is both an investment asset and a vital industrial metal. With prices at multi-year highs and structural shifts in demand underway, Budget 2026’s policy signals could leave a lasting impact on silver’s market dynamics.\n\nEntering 2026, silver prices have surged dramatically. On the Indian commodity exchange (MCX), silver futures have been trading at Rs 2,91,922 per kilogram on January 31 at 11:20 AM IST, driven by global safe-haven demand, a weakening rupee, and strong investment interest. Much of this momentum stems from broader economic uncertainty, including geopolitical tensions and inflationary pressures, which have pushed investors toward precious metals as a hedge.\n\nImport duty and price signal effects\n\nOne of the most direct ways the Budget could influence silver prices and demand is through import duty adjustments. India imports over 80 percent of its silver needs, meaning that any tariff change has a quick impact on domestic pricing and demand patterns.\n\nCurrently, silver attracts a customs duty of around 7.5 percent in India, along with GST at 3 percent, with prices often fluctuating based on global trends. Ahead of Budget Day, analysts expect that if the government reduces import duty, domestic prices could soften, making physical silver more attractive to jewellery buyers and investors. However, if duties are tightened, the opposite could occur, pushing domestic prices even higher and potentially constraining demand among cost-sensitive consumers.\n\nThe Gems and Jewellery sector has been vocal in pushing for rationalisation of import duties and GST relief to increase demand and make Indian products more competitive globally. Such measures could also indirectly support silver consumption if implemented in the Budget.\n\nIndustrial demand and green energy push\n\nBeyond taxation, Budget 2026 is expected to offer incentives aligned with India’s renewable energy ambitions. Silver plays a critical role in solar panel manufacturing and other green technologies, where its high conductivity is prized. The pre-Budget outlook suggests that policies promoting solar infrastructure, including extended production incentives and subsidies, could stimulate industrial demand for silver by 15-20 percent over time, though these effects would likely unfold gradually rather than immediately.\n\nSilver is also a critical input in electric vehicles, used extensively in power electronics, battery management systems and charging infrastructure. Any Budget support for EV adoption, domestic component manufacturing, or charging networks could lift industrial silver demand.\n\nOver the past few years, industrial usage has risen, especially from electric vehicles, electronics, and solar manufacturing. “In fact, electronics and electrical applications now account for nearly 68 percent of total industrial silver demand. This has supported prices, but it also raises the question of whether, at current record-high prices, industrial demand will continue to grow at the same pace, as manufacturers begin to look for lower-cost alternatives,” said Chirag Muni, Executive Director, Anand Rathi Wealth Limited.\n\nIn the middle of all this, investor interest has also picked up. Silver ETFs saw strong inflows in 2025, adding to overall demand and import pressure. While the Budget’s tax measures might not transform macroeconomic drivers overnight, fiscal signals, especially around import duty and industrial policy, will influence how quickly and strongly silver demand responds in the near term. For investors and industry alike, Budget 2026 could be a turning point in shaping how silver markets evolve in the year ahead.",

The heightened risk profile margins will be increased to 8.8% from the current 6.6%, it said.\n\nSilver margins will climb to 15% from the current 11% for non-heightened risk profile, while the heightened risk profile margins will be hiked to 16.5% from the current 12.1%, according to the statement. Platinum and palladium futures’ margin also will be boosted.\n\nThe change takes effect from Monday’s close and follows a “normal review of market volatility to ensure adequate collateral coverage,” it said.\n\nThe increase means those who want to trade futures of gold, silver, platinum and palladium will need to put up more collateral to ensure they can meet their obligations. While the exchange routinely raises margins when a contract is soaring, sliding or extremely volatile, Friday’s move could further edge out smaller players who don’t have enough cash to make the necessary deposits.\n\nEarlier this week, the exchange hiked margins for silver, platinum and palladium futures following price surges.",

The week remained volatile, driven by sustained FII outflows, DII support, delays in the India–US trade deal, rising geopolitical tensions, mixed corporate earnings, a weakening rupee, and a cautious outlook from the US Federal Reserve after it kept interest rates unchanged. The BSE Sensex climbed 732.08 points, or 0.89%, to close at 82,269.78, while the Nifty50 advanced 272 points, or 1.08%, to settle at 25,320.65. The BSE Large-cap index gained 1.3 percent, driven by strong rallies in ABB India, Siemens Energy India, Vodafone Idea, Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, and Adani Green Energy, which rose between 10 and 18 percent. However, Asian Paints, Hindustan Zinc, Berger Paints India, Godrej Consumer Products, and Maruti Suzuki India were among the laggards. The Nifty Mid-cap index rose 2 percent, led by gains in GE Vernova TD India, Oil India, Hitachi Energy India, Aegis Vopak Terminals, Cochin Shipyard, Gillette India, Jindal Stainless, Star Health &amp; Allied Insurance Company, and Relaxo Footwears. On the other hand, key losers included KPIT Technologies, Inventurus Knowledge Solutions, Laurus Labs, Bharti Hexacom, Balkrishna Industries, and Emami. The BSE Small-cap index jumped 3 percent, led by sharp gains in Sharda Cropchem, Hindustan Copper, MIC Electronics, SPEL Semiconductor, Panorama Studios International, JITF Infralogistics, Mahindra Logistics, Moschip Technologies, Walchandnagar Industries, Garden Reach Shipbuilders &amp; Engineers, Manorama Industries, MTAR Technologies, Data Patterns (India), Punjab Chemicals &amp; Crop Protection, Sterlite Technologies, and Taneja Aerospace and Aviation, all of which surged more than 20 percent each. Meanwhile, Vimta Labs, Sri Adhikari Brothers Television, OneSource Specialty Pharma, IFB Industries, South Indian Bank, SBFC Finance, and Best Agrolife declined over 15 percent Among sectors, the Nifty Defence index outperformed with a nearly 9 percent gain, followed by Nifty Energy, which rose 6 percent. The Nifty Oil &amp; Gas index added 4 percent, while the Nifty Realty and Metal indices climbed 3 percent each. On the other hand, the Nifty IT, FMCG, and Healthcare indices declined by 0.5 percent each. During the week, State Bank of India added the most to market capitalisation, followed by Axis Bank, Bharat Electronics, and Larsen &amp; Toubro. In contrast, Maruti Suzuki India, Asian Paints, and Kotak Mahindra Bank witnessed a decline in their market value. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) turned buyers on Friday, purchasing equities worth Rs 2,251 crore. However, they remained net sellers for the week, having offloaded shares worth Rs 730 crore. Meanwhile, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) continued their support, buying equities worth Rs 14,398.03 crore. The Indian rupee remained under pressure for the third consecutive week, hitting a fresh record low of 92.01. It closed 3 paise lower at 91.99 per dollar on January 30, compared with 91.96 on January 23, and traded in a range of 91.52–92.01 during the period.",

        "full_content": "As Budget 2026 approaches, India’s metals industry enters the new fiscal year with a rare combination of visibility and vulnerability. Demand outlook remains firm, supported by government-led infrastructure spending and the energy transition. Yet, rising costs, import dependence and policy uncertainty continue to weigh on competitiveness, sharpening expectations from this year’s Budget.\n\nThe Economic Survey projects steel demand growth of 9-10 percent, anchored by capital expenditure of Rs 11 lakh crore, equivalent to 3.2 percent of GDP. Roads, railways, including 5,364 km of high-speed corridors, and urban housing together account for nearly 69 percent of steel consumption. This trajectory aligns with India’s ambition to scale steel capacity to 300 million tonnes by 2030.\n\nBeyond steel, aluminium and copper demand is expanding alongside electric vehicle infrastructure, renewable energy targets of 500 GW and the rapid rollout of solar parks. Industry experts say, with India already ranking among the top three global solar markets, metal intensity across power and mobility infrastructure is set to rise steadily.\n\nCosts and supply risks dominate expectations\n\nDespite this demand momentum, cost pressures remain acute. India continues to import 100percent  of critical minerals such as lithium and cobalt, leaving producers exposed to global volatility. Low beneficiation rates, under 20percent  for iron ore compared to global norms of around 80percent ,further force reliance on high-grade imports, often at premiums of Rs 5,000 to Rs 7,000 per ton.\n\nLt Col Rochak Bakshi (Retd), CFP, says \"Budget 2026 could address some of these challenges through duty rationalisation. Rationalising import duties to zero on critical minerals like lithium and cobalt could help reduce dependency and ease cost pressures.”\n\nIn addition, mining royalties ranging from 15 percent to 18 percent contribute to double taxation, translating into effective cost increases of nearly 25 percent in the absence of reform. The industry is also seeking a mining policy overhaul that allows greater private participation in copper and silver extraction to improve domestic supply security.\n\nBalancing protection and competitiveness\n\nThe debate over safeguard duties has resurfaced, particularly in the steel sector, amid concerns over dumping. However, the Economic Survey cautions that excessive protectionism could inflate industrial costs and weaken downstream competitiveness.\n\nBakshi warns that delayed reforms may worsen raw material shortages just as demand accelerates. “Over-protectionism risks raising costs and eroding competitiveness at a time when global supply risks are already elevated,” he says.\n\nWhy policy stability matters in Budget 2026\n\nPolicy predictability emerges as a broader theme across metals, including gold. Mahendra Luniya, Founder and Chairman of Vighnaharta Gold Ltd, points out \"frequent changes in import duties tend to distort domestic pricing without reducing demand. A stable and rational duty framework would bring predictability and align domestic prices more closely with global benchmarks.\"\n\nLuniya adds, \"encouraging formal, traceable gold investments, such as regulated and digital gold, can channel household savings into the formal economy while maintaining demand sentiment.\"\n\nFor the metals industry as a whole, Budget 2026 is less about announcements and more about execution. With demand already locked in, the sector is looking for cost rationalisation, mining reforms and stable policy signals that allow Indian metal producers to grow competitively in an increasingly uncertain global environment.",

        "full_content": "Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on Friday as investors viewed President Donald Trump's nomination of former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh as a hawkish choice to succeed Federal Reserve Chair ​Jerome Powell, while also digesting earnings reports and a high inflation reading.\n\nOn top of assessing the risks from U.S. tensions with countries including Iran, investors were also worried about ‌the prospect of another U.S. government shutdown after new barriers emerged in the Senate to a deal that would ensure continuation of funding for agency operations.\n\nAt the Fed, Warsh, 55, is expected to favor lower interest rates but stop short of the more aggressive monetary easing linked to some other potential nominees. With Powell's term ending in May, Warsh, if confirmed by the Senate, would take the helm of a central bank he has argued should scale back its role in the economy and rethink its approach to monetary policy.\n\n\"Markets are calibrating to Trump's pick of Kevin Warsh ... and the outlook for monetary policy,\" said Michael Hans, chief investment officer at ‌Citizens Wealth, who also pointed to an unwinding of recent trading patterns with the U.S. dollar gaining ground on Friday and precious metals selling off sharply.\n\nMeanwhile, ​in earnings, Apple shares regained ground to close up 0.4% after earlier losses a day after the iPhone maker released quarterly results. On the data front, producer prices increased more than expected in December, suggesting inflation could pick up in the months ahead.\n\n\"There's a combination of investor concerns around the Fed chair announcement, some mixed tech earnings and lingering inflation pressure as well as some uncertainty about a potential government ‍shutdown even though it should be short-lived,\" said Angelo Kourkafas, senior global strategist at Edward Jones.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 179.09 points, or 0.36%, to 48,892.47, the S&P 500 lost 29.98 points, or 0.43%, to 6,939.03 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 223.30 points, or 0.94%, to 23,461.82.\n\nThe rate-sensitive, small-cap Russell 2000 index has recently been outperforming large-cap indexes but on Friday it lagged with a 1.6% loss for the day.\n\nBut the Russell 2000 ended the month up ⁠more than 5%, compared with monthly advances of 1.4% for the S&P 500 and 0.9% for the Nasdaq. The Dow, meanwhile, climbed 1.7% for January, to notch a ninth consecutive monthly advance, its longest ‍winning streak since 2018.\n\nFor the week, the S&P 500 rose 0.3%, the Dow fell 0.4% and the Nasdaq fell 0.2%.\n\nThe S&P's Materials index led declines among the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors, with a 1.9% loss, ‌as U.S.-listed gold ‌and silver miners tumbled in sympathy with the massive selloff in gold prices and in silver.\n\nDefensive consumer staples was the sector with the biggest advance on the day, rising 1.4%. Colgate-Palmolive (CL.N), opens new tab was its biggest gainer, closing up 5.9%, after the maker of toothpaste and soap forecast annual sales above Wall Street estimates on steady demand for household staples in markets such as Latin America and Europe.\n\nInvestors have given a mixed reception to megacap earnings reports this week with a stark warning that record capital‑spending binges will be tolerated as long as the growth keeps coming.\n\nApple wrapped up the week with a forecast of higher-than-expected revenue growth of ⁠up to 16% for the March quarter, but ⁠warned that rising memory-chip prices had started ​to pressure profitability.\n\nMicrosoft ended down 0.7% on Friday after falling 10% on Thursday for its deepest daily loss since March 2020 after its cloud revenue failed to impress. Meta shares closed 3% lower on Friday.\n\nAfter falling on Thursday following its results, Tesla shares rose 3.3% on Friday, providing the S&P 500 with its biggest boost, after reports that SpaceX is exploring deals with the electric-vehicle maker and other companies run by Elon Musk.\n\nVerizon Communications was the ‍S&P 500's second-biggest boost, finishing up 11.8% after it forecast annual profit and free cash flow above market expectations on Friday, after aggressive promotions during the peak holiday period fueled its highest quarterly wireless subscriber additions in six years.\n\nSanDisk shares rallied 6.9% after a better-than-expected third-quarter forecast as AI fuels storage demand. But KLA Corp shares tumbled 15.2% even after the company beat Wall Street expectations for second-quarter profit and revenue.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.59-to-1 ratio on the NYSE ​where there were 247 new highs and 154 new lows. On the Nasdaq, 1,599 stocks rose and 3,222 fell as ‍declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.02-to-1 ratio.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 19 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 72 new highs and 205 new lows.\n\nOn U.S. exchanges, 23.88 billion shares changed hands compared with the 19.42 ​billion moving average for the last 20 trading sessions.",

        "full_content": "As FM Nirmala Sitharaman prepares to present the Budget, India is framing its growth strategy against a turbulent global backdrop, one where there are new global realignments and partnerships. With capital flows to emerging markets turning increasingly selective, policymakers are expected to rely on domestic growth engines like consumption, investment and structural reforms.\n\nGlobally, the outlook remains volatile. Commodity markets have seen sharp swings, with metals and precious metals rallying on supply concerns and safe-haven demand. At the same time, tighter global financial conditions and valuation concerns have made portfolio flows more volatile, increasing the importance of credible macro policy and stable growth visibility.\n\nDomestically, India enters the Budget season on a relatively firm footing. Private consumption has been resilient, supported by improving urban demand and a gradual recovery in rural spending. The Budget is expected to support demand through tax simplification and targeted relief measures rather than large fiscal giveaways.\n\nGST rationalisation remains another important growth lever. Recent rate restructuring has reduced complexity.\n\nOn the direct tax side, expectations are centred on income tax simplification rather than aggressive rate cuts. Potential measures include a higher standard deduction, further rationalisation of slabs under the new tax regime and consolidation of multiple TDS provisions. The government could consider either doing away with STT or Capital gains tax to avoid double taxation and simplify the regime.\n\nDividend income at present faces “onerous” double taxation whereby companies pay taxes on profits, then investors pay again on the dividend income. There is a possibility of moving back to a zero tax or a flat 10% dividend tax regime similar to the earlier practice.\n\nInvestment is expected to be a key growth pillar. Public capital expenditure is likely to stay elevated, with continued focus on infrastructure such as roads, railways, power, logistics and urban development. Beyond supporting near-term demand, sustained public capex has improved the investment climate by reducing logistics costs and easing supply bottlenecks. The Budget is also expected to focus on private capex, leveraging healthier corporate balance sheets through better PPP frameworks and credit facilitation.\n\nPolicymakers should also shift focus from capex alone to innovation-led growth, with targeted R&D incentives. This is critical for pharma, defence, and BFSI, helping India move up the value chain, deepen indigenisation, and broaden market participation while supporting long-term productivity and export competitiveness.\n\nSimplification of FPIs compliance is emerging as an important reform lever amid volatile portfolio flows. After net equity outflows in FY25 and FY26, to improve ease of participation and stabilise foreign capital flows, we believe India should address current outstanding ambiguities around trade, regulations, and tax-related matters.\n\nWhile recently, overseas inflows have been tepid, India’s growth alpha over other global economies and stable macro fundamentals make it a natural candidate to be a recipient of overseas flows, once geopolitical tensions subside.\n\nManufacturing is set to remain central to the medium-term strategy. The emphasis is gradually shifting from capacity creation to building robust ecosystems, deeper supply chains, higher domestic value addition, better logistics and skilling to support exports and employment.\n\nOverall, Budget 2026–27 should prioritise continuity and execution. In an uncertain global environment, India’s ability to rely on resilient consumption, sustained investment, and incremental but credible reforms could once again underpin its competitive advantage and growth.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "Bengaluru-based developer Roy Chiriankandath Joseph, better known as CJ Roy, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his home in the city on January 30, during an Income Tax raid there. His death culminates in a two decade journey of working at large firms, and making it as an entrepreneur with his real estate firm Confident Group, with his life criss-crossing cinema, and a jet-setting lifestyle.\n\nA former employee at corporates such as BPL, Hewlett-Packard, and others, his venture into real estate through a land parcel in Sarjapura turned out to be a multi-bagger, and his near-two decade empire resulted in considerable name and fame even beyond homes, becoming a large film producer as well.\n\nThat fame, including associations with Malayali cinema's leading man Mohanlal, brought him a large following on social media, with 1.3 million followers on Instagram. Roy was known to be conspicuous with his wealth, often parading his sports cars to his followers, from a Rolls-Royce to a Bugatti, both in India and at his base in Dubai, which he often referred to as his home. According to industry insiders, Roy has a considerable empire in Dubai as well, largely looked after by his son.\n\nThe group constructed more than 40 million square feet in real estate across his target markets. And in Bengaluru, where he started his business, he has increasingly taken the joint development route, with the group targeting 1,000 acres in joint development projects. In 2025, the group is developing around 412 acres through the \"asset-light\" route.\n\nBesides his ventures in the Bengaluru, and in the UAE, markets, Roy, a native of Kerala, invested considerably in his home state, as wealth flowing from the state's significant diaspora made for ripe pickings. His interests, mainly apartment projects in the mid-premium categories, but also bungalows and plots, remained in the state's capital Thiruvananthapuram, the state's largest city Kochi, as well as major district headquarters such as Thrissur and Kozhikode.\n\nAll told, the group has as many as 50 projects in Kerala, according to the Kerala Real Estate Regulatory Authority (KRERA), many of them being under construction.\n\nHis association with his home state extended to major films, even \"rescuing\" film projects stuck in development hell. With Mohanlal, Roy produced films such as Casanovva in 2012, which did moderately at the box office. Roy was one of the producers of the historical epic Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham in 2021, where Mohanlal played the titular role. Like Casanovva, Marakkar also did moderately in theatres, despite the hype and the large production budget.\n\nRoy had more luck in recent years in Malayali cinema, as well as in the Karnataka film industry, with films such as Identity, starring Tovino Thomas and Trisha Krishnan, being one of the highest grossers in the Malayali film industry for 2025. Besides films, Roy sponsored the Malayalam edition of the reality show Bigg Boss, and held an honorary role as a consul of Slovakia.\n\nThe Confident Group was not available for comment on the story. In a post on social media, the company mourned Roy's death, saying that his vision for the group lives on.",

        "full_content": "Gold and silver suffered their biggest slide in years, in a whipsawing reversal of a scorching rally that lifted prices to all-time highs.\n\nGold dropped as much as 8% to crash through $5,000 an ounce, while silver plunged more than 20% in the biggest intraday drop since 2008 as the selloff swept through the broader metals markets. Copper fell almost 4% in London, after surging above $14,000 a ton for the first time Thursday in its biggest intraday jump since 2008.\n\nA wave of investor demand into precious metals over the past year has taken out record after record, shocked seasoned traders and driven exceptional price volatility. That only accelerated in January, as investors piled into the time-honored havens amid concerns about currency debasement and the Federal Reserve’s independence, trade wars and geopolitical tensions.\n\nBoth gold and silver are still set for hefty monthly gains, but Friday’s selloff is the biggest shock to the rally since a similar slump in October. It was triggered by the dollar rebounding after a report the Trump administration was preparing to nominate Kevin Warsh for Fed chair, now confirmed. The greenback’s rally undercut sentiment among investors who had been piling into metals after the president signaled a willingness to let the currency weaken.\n\nGold’s move “validates the cautionary tale of fast-up, fast-down,” said Christopher Wong, a strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. While reports of Warsh’s nomination were a trigger, a correction was overdue, he said. “It’s like one of those excuses markets are waiting for to unwind those parabolic moves.”\n\nPrecious metals had already been primed for extreme moves, as soaring prices and volatility strained traders’ risk models and balance sheets. A record wave of purchases of call options, contracts which give holders the right to buy at a pre-determined price, had also “mechanically reinforcing upward price momentum,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a note, as the sellers of the options hedged their exposure to rising prices by buying more.\n\nBullion’s slide may have been accelerated by a so-called gamma squeeze. That’s where dealers that are short options need to buy more futures — or shares in the case of the gold exchange-traded funds — as prices rise through levels of large options holdings and sell as they fall back through, to keep their portfolios balanced. For the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, there were large positions expiring Friday at $465 and $455, while on Comex, sizable March and April options positions were at $5,300, $5,200 and $5,100.\n\nThe metals rout also drove down shares of major mining companies including top gold producers Newmont Corp., Barrick Mining Corp. and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd., whose shares had slid more than 8% in New York trading.\n\nEven after the pullback, gold is still up around 18% in January, closing in on its sharpest monthly gain since 1980. The jump in silver has been eye-watering, with the white metal up more than 40% so far this year.\n\nThe extent of the correction “suggests that market participants were simply waiting for an opportunity to take profits after the rapid price rise,” analysts in Commerzbank AG wrote in a note Friday. Still, while rumours of Warsh’s appointment may have triggered the fall, there is a high probability that the Fed “will yield to pressure to at least some extent and cut interest rates more than is currently priced in by the market,” Commerzbank said.\n\nWith gold and silver jumping so much already this year, some technical indicators flashed warning signs. One is the relative-strength index, which in recent weeks signaled that both metals may have become overbought and due a correction. Gold’s RSI recently hit 90, the highest it has been for the precious metal in decades.\n\nVolatility is very extreme and both psychological resistance levels of $5,000 and $100 respectively have been broken numerous times on Friday, according to Dominik Sperzel, head of trading at Heraeus Precious Metals. “We need to prepare for the roller-coaster to continue though.”\n\nChinese investors have led the charge, buying in such force that it prompted the Shanghai Futures Exchange to rush out measures to cool the surge in precious and industrial metal markets.\n\nPresidentDonald Trumpsaid he intends to nominate Warsh to be the next chair of the Fed in a post on Friday. The former Fed governor has a longstanding reputation as an inflation hawk, but has aligned himself with the president in recent months by arguing publicly for lower interest rates. Trump said he would announce his nominee on Friday morning US time.\n\nMeanwhile, the risk of another US government shutdown was avoided after Trump and Senate Democrats reached a tentative deal. The White House is continuing to negotiate with Democrats on placing new limits on immigration raids that have provoked a national outcry.\n\nSpot gold fell 7.4% to $4,977.06 an ounce as of 11:53 a.m. in New York. Silver plunged 20% to $92.96 an ounce, while platinum and palladium also tumbled. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index gained 0.6%",

        "full_content": "The dearness allowance for the central government employees is set to be raised by 5 percent, taking the overall hike to 63 percent, as the Ministry of Labour and Employment retained the AICPI-IW index at 148.2 for December 2025.\n\nThe All India Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers is a key input for revising dearness allowance for central government employees and pensioners to safeguard salaries and pensions from the impact of inflation.\n\n“With the Centre keeping the AICPI-IW index unchanged at 148.2, the dearness allowance will be raised by 5 percent. This means the DA will be hiked 63 percent,” said Manjeet Singh Patel, president of the All India NPS Employees Federation.\n\nThe revision of dearness allowance is due in January 2026 as part of the biannual cycle. The government had increased DA from 54 percent to 58 percent in July 2025.\n\nFollowing the routine practice, the Centre will likely implement the hike in DA for central government employees in March-April 2026. Employees can hope to receive their DA hike in April’s salary, which will cover the arrears from January 2026.\n\nHow is central government DA calculated?\n\nAccording to Patel, with December’s AICPI-IW at 148.2, the central government employees will see the hike in DA be raised by 5%, from the current 58 percent to 63 percent.\n\nDA (%) = [{(Average AICPI-IW of last 12 months × 2.88) − 261.41} / 261.41​] × 100 − Existing DA (%)\n\nWhat about the transport allowance hike?\n\nWhenever the Centre implements the dearness allowance, the transport allowance is also raised by the same percentage.\n\nThe 7th Pay Commission determined thattransport allowance for central government employeesdepends on their pay level and the category of city where they are posted. Cities are classified into three groups—X, Y and Z—with X-category cities attracting higher transport allowance than Y and Z.\n\nThe allowance is paid as a fixed monthly amount, with dearness allowance added to it. In addition, employees at Level 14 and above who are eligible for an official car but choose not to use it receive Rs 15,750 per month, while employees with disabilities are entitled to twice the applicable transport allowance.\n\nLet’s take an example of the central government employee in Pay Level 5 posted in a Y-category city who draws a base transport allowance of Rs 1,800. When the dearness allowance is raised to 63 percent, his transport allowance will increase by Rs 1,134, taking the total to Rs 2,934.\n\nEmployee bodies call for merger of DA with basic pay\n\nSeveral organisations representing government employees have been calling for the merger of dearness allowance with basic pay since the government announced the terms of reference for the8th Pay Commissionin early November.\n\n“Employees are eagerly awaiting immediate relief, and the government should consider merging the existing DA with basic pay. With DA already trailing inflation and gold prices continuing to surge, such a move would offer much-needed support,” said Patel.\n\nThat being said, the Centre earlier clarified that there hasn’t been a proposal tomerge dearness allowance with the basic pay, as an intermediate relief measure for central government employees.\n\n“No proposal regarding merger of the existing dearness allowance with the basic is under consideration with the government at present,” Pankaj Chaudhary, minister of state in the Ministry of Finance, told Lok Sabha in a written reply dated December 1, 2025.",

It also remains sanguine on growth revival in the near term, as macros turn favourable. Our cautious stance too remains intact given SHOP’s: 1) low confidence on near-term revenue growth; 2) inability to convert revenue growth into profits, suggesting operational inefficiencies; and 3) weak cost control potentially restricting margin improvement and earnings growth, even if sales growth remains strong. Retain HOLD with a revised price target of INR 350 (vs. INR 400 earlier).\n\nWe model revenue/EBITDA CAGRs of 10.1%/10% over FY25–28E and maintain HOLD, with a DCF-based revised target price of INR 350 (vs. INR 400 earlier)\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

The company has rolled out a series of new product launches, including Colgate Total, Colgate Visible through dental professionals, all of which are currently expanding their distribution footprint in India.\n\n\"Underlying demand in India, mostly in the low-income urban consumer, continues to be rather soft. Our focus, strategy and innovation are really to grow the premium side of the business in the urban market,\" said Noel Wallace, chief executive officer of Colgate Palmolive told analysts in a post earnings call on January 30.\n\nIn the December quarter, Colgate posted an 1.66 per cent rise in sales at Rs Rs 1,486.13 crore, while net profit was flat at Rs  323.86 crore.\n\nAlongside premiumisation, Colgate is also working through the impact of recent GST-related changes, which had affected execution. The management said it is largely past these disruptions and expects execution to improve going forward.\n\n\"We believe the GST rate cut is an enabler, with Colgate having passed on the benefits to consumers; this will help arrest volume pressure in the near term and drive volume growth in the medium term,\" analysts at Emkay wrote in a note dated January 30.\n\nLooking ahead, the company said it has a strong plan for 2026, building on several changes and interventions implemented in 2025, which it expects will translate into a much stronger year for the India business\n\n\"Our concerns about a single-category company with elevated margin levels continue, with Colgate India dealing with competitive stress and macro hiccups in its topline performance. The GST cut, though, is likely to help demand with affordability; however, we see the benefit to be limited for Colgate, as premiumization and a ‘twice brushing’ habit will call for high media spending and innovations ahead,\" Emkay added.",

        "full_content": "As the Union Budget 2026 draws near, India’s real estate sector has urged the government to grant the sector an industry status, digitise land records and introduce a simplified single-window clearance mechanism to accelerate approvals and revive demand.\n\nIndustry bodies and developers argue that recognising real estate as an “industry” would unlock cheaper long-term institutional credit, lower borrowing costs and broader access to structured financing.\n\nDevelopers said that industry status has been a long-pending demand and they remain optimistic, expecting sustained policy support in the budget. The status has also been sought due to a consolidation in the market towards larger developers, driven by factors such as the Real Estate Regulatory Act (RERA), Goods and Services Tax, and Union and state-level housing policies.\n\n“The real estate sector currently contributes around 7 percent to India’s GDP and supports over 200 allied industries. Granting industry status to real estate sector would improve access to institutional funding and enable the sector to play a stronger role in job creation and economic growth. Real estate has the potential to contribute up to 15 percent to India’s GDP by 2047 with the help of adequate policy support,”  Signature Global (India) Ltd founder and chairman Pradeep Aggarwal has said.\n\nTribeca Developers group CEO Rajat Khandelwal said the sector is looking for policy continuity that supports both supply and demand. “Granting industry status to real estate remains crucial, as it would ease access to long-term capital; lower borrowing costs, and improve execution efficiency for developers,” he said.\n\nKhandelwal said real estate growth is closely tied to infrastructure. Increased investments in urban infrastructure, public transport and smart city initiatives will not only make cities liveable but also strengthen the realty sector. Major real estate projects have developed around metro corridors, owing to incentives related to transit-oriented development.\n\nSterling Developers chairman and managing director Ramani Sastri said industry status will help the real estate sector realise its full potential, as it will unlock affordable funding and streamline regulatory processes.\n\n“Overall, we would like to see announcements to enhance ease of doing business for the developers to create positive climate for real estate investment,” he said.\n\nSingle-window clearance and digitisation of land records\n\nDevelopers have also sought single-window clearances, consolidating approvals from multiple authorities on a unified digital platform. It will cut the red tape, reduce project gestation periods and enhance transparency, they have argued.\n\nTRG Group MD Shorab Upadhyay said realtors are looking forward to a Union Budget that brings in stability, liquidity and confidence in the real estate sector.\n\n“We expect better policy support towards faster project approvals, single-window clearances, and digitisation of land records, which are much-needed steps in substantially enhancing ease of doing business and accelerating delivery timelines,” he said.\n\nNotandas Realty managing director Harsh Jagwani said a single-window clearance system is “long overdue” and capable of accelerating approvals and injecting much-needed efficiency into project execution.\n\nThe government should also bring reforms in the digitisation process of land as well as property acquisition. “This will not only help in accelerating the pace of development of new projects but also ease the process of buying new homes for homebuyers in general. Cleaner land-title system, stricter escrow enforcement under RERA will also help reduce transaction risk and financing delays,” he said.",

        "full_content": "The senior citizens hope that the Budget 2026 will focus on higher exemption limits on tax. Hopes are also building for possible expansion of National Pension System (NPS) tax benefits for the elderly, and a comprehensive health scheme covering in-home care.\n\nEmphasis on higher exemption limits\n\nAlthough the Income Tax Act offers several deductions for Indian residents aged 60 and above, the central demand is that the basic exemption limit be raised to ease the tax burden.\n\nCurrently, Section 80TTB under the old tax regime allows resident senior citizens (60–80 years) to claim a deduction of up to Rs 50,000 on interest income from savings and fixed deposits.\n\nOther major expectations include higher exemption limits for medical expenses—under Section 80D for health insurance and critical illness, and Section 80DDB for treatment of specified chronic diseases—along with simplified TDS and TCS norms to cut compliance hassles for seniors.\n\n“An upward revision of exemption thresholds, coupled with simplified slab structures, would provide much-needed relief to pensioners and retirees dependent on fixed incomes,” said Kunal Savani, partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.\n\nTax analysts say many senior citizens have passive income in the form of capital gains, but such profits earned from capital gains aren’t eligible for a tax rebate under Section 87A.\n\n“Given the current scenario of rebate under section 87A, one can expect the government specifically spell out its allowance to senior citizens to avail the rebate on such capital gains, which provides the much-needed relief to such senior taxpayers,” Savani said.\n\nHopes are also building for enhanced pension participation through the National Pension System (NPS), which offers significant tax benefits via deductions under Section 80CCD under both old and new tax regimes.\n\n“Extending tax benefits on NPS contributions under the new tax regime to both salaried and self-employed individuals will help encourage long-term, disciplined retirement savings,” PB Fintech's retirement planning arm Pensionbazaar head Vishwajeet Goel said.\n\nPB Fintec joint group CEO Sarbvir Singh said there is an urgent need for sustained, long-term pension savings and retirement preparedness is emerging as a critical pillar of India’s financial ecosystem.\n\n“The Budget 2026 can encourage disciplined retirement savings by extending NPS tax benefits to both salaried and self-employed individuals. Also, delinking employer participation from the employee’s tax benefit will allow voluntary contributions up to the defined threshold,” Sing said.\n\nA comprehensive scheme for in-home care\n\nOptimism is growing that the Budget 2026 will establish a comprehensive scheme of benefits covering in-home care, assisted living support and transitional care facilities for senior citizens.\n\nAnalysts argue that the biggest cost pressure seniors face is not hospitalisation but prolonged home-based care such as attendants, nursing, physiotherapy and assisted living support, which runs for years and is almost entirely out-of-pocket.\n\n“Budget 2026 can realistically ease this by recognising certified home-care and long-term care expenses as core health costs with a separate, high-limit tax deduction for seniors and their children, instead of forcing families to absorb these recurring costs without any fiscal relief,” said Raheel Patel, partner, Gandhi Law Associates.",

You should be the last person to obtain benefit from the company only after every employee has gotten,” Murthy said in a fireside chat at IIM-Bangalore along with former CEO and MD of HDFC Bank Aditya Puri.\n\nThe session was moderated by M.D. Ranganath, the Chairman of Catamaran Ventures, shines a light on their leadership journeys.\n\nFraming the issue beyond pay alone, Murthy said leaders must consistently demonstrate commitment to organisational values. “In order to keep the memory fresh of the values of the organisation, the leader has to demonstrate his or her commitment to the values from time to time,” he said.\n\nMurthy also recalled Infosys’s early focus on broad-based wealth creation, particularly through employee stock ownership.\n\nHe said the company had distributed stock at an unprecedented scale in India, benefiting employees across levels, from support staff to managers. “The then value of the stock options that we provided was $19 billion on a market capitalization of about $60 billion. That’s almost 30% to the employee… the best peon, the best clerk, the best accountant, the best software manager, every one of them benefited a lot.”\n\nThe Infosys founder highlighted that leadership responsibility extends to safeguarding stakeholder trust, including that of minority shareholders. “A shareholder at large, a minority shareholder, he or she puts either her hard-earned money in your company and if you were to lead a profligate life and blow it up, then you’re not a great human being.”\n\n‘India’s finest entrepreneur post-Independence’\n\nMurthy described legendary banker Aditya Puri as “India’s finest entrepreneur post-Independence,” drawing a contrast between the paths taken by Infosys and HDFC Bank in building scale and influence.\n\n“I call Aditya Puri India’s finest entrepreneur post-Independence,” Murthy. “Infosys focussed on revenues outside India, he succeeded in the Indian environment.”\n\nMurthy highlighted the difference in outcomes by citing market cap: “Infosys is at $70 billion, (while) HDFC is at $180 billion,” he said.\n\nPuri, reflecting on his early awareness of Murthy, said the Infosys founder’s reputation had travelled well beyond India. “i heard about him when I was working in Malaysia,” Puri said, adding that Murthy’s example “inspired me to come back to India.”\n\nFurther, Puri highlighted the need for values and unit level profitability. \"There is no Ebidta or adjusted Ebidta. You're either profitable or you're not, he said",

He added, “With SEBI’s approval, we embark on a new chapter of value creation for all our stakeholders. This approval also reinforces confidence in NSE being an integral part of the Indian economy and a beacon of Indian capital markets.”\n\nThe much awaited issue will unlock value for key institutions including LIC, SBI and Stock Holding Corportation.\n\nThe regulatory nod marks a major breakthrough for India’s largest stock exchange, whose IPO plans had been on hold for nearly a decade amid regulatory and governance-related issues. The approval allows NSE to begin formal preparations for the listing, including appointing advisers and filing its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP).\n\nNSE gets key approval for its IPO, settlement to follow in due course\n\nMoneycontrol had reported that SEBI’s clearance comes after NSE undertook a series of steps to address long-pending regulatory concerns, including settlement applications related to legacy cases such as the co-location and dark fibre matters. The exchange has also resolved inspection-related issues in recent months, clearing the way for the regulator’s no-objection certificate.\n\nNSE had first announced plans to go public in 2016, but the proposal was repeatedly delayed as SEBI sought stronger governance standards and closure of outstanding cases. The IPO is expected to be structured largely as an offer for sale.\n\nMarket participants view the approval as a landmark moment for India’s capital markets, given NSE’s central role in equity, derivatives and debt trading. Analysts say the eventual listing could be among the largest in the country and would broaden investor participation in a key market infrastructure institution.\n\nFollowing the approval, NSE said further steps, including settlement processes and regulatory filings, would be taken in due course. The timeline for the IPO will depend on regulatory reviews once the draft documents are submitted.",

That beats a previous high of $704.89 billion set in September 2024.\n\nA larger reserve buffer gives the central bank more firepower to defend the rupee. The currency is the worst performer in emerging markets this year, weighed down by outflows from equities and a delay in clinching a trade deal with the US.\n\nThe broad increase in gold prices have helped prop up the reserves. The precious metal is set for its best monthly gain since 1982 this month, rising around 18% on the back of geopolitical tensions.\n\n“The latest rise in the reserves reflects a positive valuation effect from gold, but it also gives the RBI breathing space in an uncertain global environment,” said Anubhuti Sahay, Head of India Economic Research, Standard Chartered Bank.\n\n“Going ahead, however, key variables are the size of the RBI’s short forward dollar book as well as lack of visibility of how much more it can build up reserves in an environment of pressure on the rupee,” she added.",

It argues that capex delivers more durable gains in household incomes by improving infrastructure, lowering transaction costs, crowding in private investment and supporting employment.\n\nOn reviving private investment\n\nThe Survey notes that uncertainty, especially sector-specific regulatory and policy uncertainty, has a disproportionate impact on private capital formation. To address this, it calls for simpler, more predictable regulatory frameworks, targeted deregulation and stable laws, particularly in sectors that are most sensitive to uncertainty shocks.\n\nA notable structural recommendation relates to indigenisation and supply-chain resilience. The Survey outlines a tiered framework that distinguishes between high-urgency sectors requiring rapid domestic scale-up—such as fertiliser inputs, APIs, power electronics and telecom equipment—and strategic core areas like battery cells, magnets and solar wafers, where vulnerability reduction rather than full substitution is the objective.\n\nLower-urgency sectors are earmarked for gradual localisation, cluster-based development and long-horizon capability building.\n\nThe Survey also flags emerging growth engines such as the “orange economy” or concert economy, noting that live entertainment has crossed Rs 10,000 crore in size post-pandemic. To unlock its potential, the government is working on a single-window clearance mechanism for live events, addressing the current requirement of 10–15 separate approvals.\n\nOther reform signals include a renewed push for industrial clusters to build manufacturing ecosystems, a return to BOT-style PPP models to revive greenfield infrastructure investment, and a sharper focus on skill development. Proposals such as composite schools, affordable housing for working women under the Sakhi Niwas scheme, and a unified digital platform linking workers, skills and vacancies point to a more integrated approach to labour markets.",

Analysts have commented on what lies ahead for the precious metals, and what investors should do.\n\nGold futures with April expiry on MCX dropped around 9 percent to hit a low of Rs 1,67,406 per 10 grams. This comes a day after the contracts hit a fresh lifetime high of Rs 1,93,096 per 10 grams. This means that the gold futures fell 13 percent (Rs 25,690 per 10 grams) in just one day.\n\nSilver futures with March expiry meanwhile dropped nearly 17 percent to Rs 3,32,002 per kilogram.

        "full_content": "Your 30s don’t usually feel like a retirement-planning decade. There’s too much else going on. Careers are still settling, families are growing, loans are being taken, and life feels expensive in ways it never did in your 20s. But this is exactly why this decade matters so much. The financial habits you form now quietly decide how hard or easy your 60s will be.\n\nHere are 10 habits that make the biggest difference.\n\n1. You start saving before you feel “ready”\n\nMost people wait for the perfect moment to save seriously. Higher salary, fewer expenses, more stability. That moment rarely arrives. People who do well later are the ones who start saving even when it feels uncomfortable. Small, consistent investments in your 30s get decades to compound. Waiting for comfort is one of the costliest delays.\n\n2. You treat retirement as non-negotiable\n\nIn your 30s, it’s tempting to see retirement saving as optional. Something you’ll ramp up later. The people who retire comfortably usually decide early that retirement comes first, before lifestyle upgrades. They increase savings when income rises, instead of letting expenses absorb every raise.\n\n3. You don’t rely on “one big asset” to save you\n\nMany people in their 30s mentally outsource retirement to one thing. A house, a business, an inheritance, or a future windfall. That’s risky. Markets change, businesses fail, property cycles stall. A solid retirement plan is boring and diversified, not dependent on a single lucky outcome.\n\n4. You keep lifestyle inflation on a short leash\n\nIncome growth in your 30s is often real, and so is lifestyle creep. Bigger homes, better cars, more convenience spending. The habit that matters is not avoiding enjoyment, but slowing the pace at which expenses rise compared to income. Even a small gap between the two can become long-term wealth.\n\n5. You take enough risk, but not reckless risk\n\nYour 30s are when you can afford market volatility, but only if you understand it. Avoiding equity altogether is usually a mistake. Chasing hot themes blindly is another. The habit that pays off is sticking to a risk level you can live with through good and bad markets, without panic exits.\n\n6. You protect your downside early\n\nInsurance often feels like a grudge purchase. But locking in adequate health and term insurance in your 30s protects your future savings from being wiped out by one bad event. This is not about optimism or pessimism. It’s about not letting emergencies hijack long-term plans.\n\n7. You separate goals instead of mixing everything\n\nRetirement money should not constantly be raided for short-term needs. People who do well create mental and actual separation between money meant for retirement and money meant for goals like travel, education, or upgrades. This habit prevents silent erosion of long-term wealth.\n\n8. You review, even when nothing feels wrong\n\nA quiet but powerful habit is periodic review. Not because something is broken, but because life keeps changing. Goals move, risk tolerance evolves, and portfolios drift. People who course-correct early avoid painful corrections later.\n\n9. You avoid debt becoming permanent background noise\n\nNot all debt is bad, but permanent high EMIs crowd out long-term investing. In your 30s, the habit that matters is resisting the urge to stack multiple long-tenure obligations without a clear payoff. Retirement suffers when every surplus rupee is already spoken for.\n\n10. You think in decades, not just years\n\nThe biggest shift in your 30s is mental. You stop thinking only about the next few years and start thinking in 20- and 30-year blocks. This long view changes how you invest, spend, and react to short-term noise. It’s often the difference between financial stress and financial resilience later.\n\nRetirement outcomes are rarely decided by one brilliant investment or one perfect year. They’re shaped by habits repeated quietly over decades. Your 30s are when those habits harden. You don’t need perfection. You just need consistency, restraint, and the willingness to think longer than feels natural right now.",

        "full_content": "A lot of business owners sign up for a business credit card thinking it works like a corporate line of credit. It usually doesn’t. In India, business credit cards are closer to personal cards with a business label than to true company borrowing. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it’s important to know what you’re getting into.\n\nWhat a business credit card really means in India\n\nMost business credit cards in India are issued to individuals who run businesses, not to businesses as fully separate legal entities. Even if the card carries your firm’s name, the bank almost always asks for a personal guarantee. In simple terms, if the bill isn’t paid, the bank comes after you, not just the business.\n\nThis is especially true for sole proprietors, freelancers, and small private limited companies. Large corporates operate differently, but for most people, a business card is still tied closely to their personal credit profile.\n\nIn daily life, business credit cards are used for fairly routine things. Travel bookings, fuel, online ads, software subscriptions, client meals, and office purchases are common. They’re handy because they centralise spending and make it easier to track business expenses in one place.\n\nFunctionally, they work just like personal cards. You get a statement every month, a due date, and the option to pay in full or revolve the balance. Interest kicks in quickly if you don’t clear dues, and it’s expensive.\n\nBanks usually look at two things before setting a limit: your business cash flows and your personal credit history. Even if your business is doing reasonably well, a weak personal credit score can hold you back. This reflects how lending works in India, under rules overseen by the Reserve Bank of India, where individual responsibility still matters a lot for small businesses.\n\nIn practice, this means a business credit card doesn’t insulate your personal finances from your business. The two remain closely linked.\n\nAbout rewards and “benefits” Business cards often advertise rewards linked to travel, fuel, or business services. These can be useful, but they’re rarely game-changing. If you carry balances month to month, interest costs will wipe out any rewards very quickly. These cards work best when dues are paid in full.\n\nThe biggest issue is using business credit cards to plug ongoing cash shortfalls. Cards are meant for short-term timing gaps, not for funding losses or slow-paying clients. Another common mistake is mixing personal and business spending, which creates accounting headaches and tax confusion later.\n\nThere’s also a tendency to underestimate personal risk. Because the card says “business”, people assume liability is limited. In most cases, it isn’t.\n\nBusiness credit cards can be genuinely useful if you treat them as a convenience tool, not as funding. They help with tracking expenses and smoothing short-term cash flow. But in India, they are still very much tied to the individual behind the business. Used carefully and paid off on time, they can help. Used casually, they can quietly drag both business and personal finances down.",

        "full_content": "For equity investors, performance is increasingly determined not just by market movements but by how much is left after taxes and transaction charges. With both capital gains tax and securities transaction tax (STT) adding to the cost of investing, the margins have narrowed. As the Union Budget 2026 draws closer, investors are keen to see whether the government eases this layered burden or opts to maintain the status quo.\n\nSenthil R Kumar, MD & CEO of Nitstone Finserv, says any relief in STT would be a welcome step to make markets more accessible and strengthen investor confidence, supporting India’s growing equity culture.\n\nThe deepest impact seems to be from the doubling of STT, which was announced in the previous Budget. The rates on options selling were increased from 0.0625 percent to 0.1 percent of the option premium, while STT on futures trades went up from 0.0125 percent to 0.02 percent of the contract value.\n\nAt the same time, the tax burden on gains has also risen. Long-term capital gains tax was increased from 10 percent to 12.5 percent, while short-term capital gains moved up from 15 percent to 20 percent. According to brokerages and mutual fund distributors, this combination of higher taxes is dampening the appeal of market-linked investment products.\n\nInvestor unease is most evident around STT. When it was introduced in 2004, equity long-term capital gains were exempt, and STT was pitched as a modest, straightforward levy that could replace capital gains tax while improving transaction tracking. Nearly twenty years on, with capital gains taxes firmly back in place, the relevance and structure of STT are once again under scrutiny.\n\nRohit Jain, Managing Partner at Singhania & Co, notes that STT was introduced to replace LTCG tax. With LTCG now reinstated, the system effectively collects double taxes on the same income, and STT, levied on transaction value rather than profit, becomes a sunk cost that cannot be recovered even in losses.\n\nRetail-focused traders and brokers are hopeful that STT on delivery-based equity trades will be rationalised. They argue that lowering this cost would meaningfully reduce friction for long-term investors and could unlock broader participation in the securities market. Several market voices even feel STT should be removed entirely, given that trading costs are already high due to capital gains tax and brokerage expenses.\n\nSR Patnaik, Partner (Head–Taxation) at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, says traders expect the Budget 2026 to rationalise or reduce STT for delivery-based equity trades as it would substantially cut trading costs and boost market activity.\n\nB. Shravanth Shanker of B. Shanker Advocates LLP points out that STT directly erodes long-term post-tax returns and that a calibrated reduction could strengthen household participation without materially affecting revenue.\n\nAnkit Jain, Partner at Ved Jain and Associates, emphasises that while STT is a behavioural tool to discourage excessive speculation, the overlapping tax layers present a psychological barrier for new investors, even if they are less harmful to disciplined long-term portfolios.\n\nAbhishek Dev, Co-founder of Epsilon Money, says the street expects some ease in capital formation measures, especially on STT and related taxes, in the upcoming budget to improve medium- and long-term sentiment.\n\nFor small investors, the cumulative burden of STT, capital gains tax, brokerage, exchange charges, and GST significantly reduce effective returns, especially on modest portfolios. Unlike institutional players, retail investors lack the scale to absorb transaction costs efficiently. This layered cost structure discourages frequent participation and long - term compounding. Equity investors are demanding that Budget 2026 treat STT relief as part of a broader transaction cost rationalisation to improve market accessibility.",

        "full_content": "Silver exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in India have experienced substantial growth driven by high demand and industrial use. They are delivering strong, sometimes triple-digit, returns, attracting significant investor interest alongside gold. In a scenario like this, will the government take measures to regulate or cool investor inflows into silver ETFs, similar to past interventions in other overheated asset classes?\n\nWhile there have been no official announcements from the finance ministry regarding any curbs or measures to regulate, the recent froth in Silver ETFs makes regulatory scrutiny highly likely.\n\n\"Historical precedents suggest that if an asset class experiences parabolic growth – such as the recent annual returns of more than 270% seen in some Indian Silver ETFs – the finance minister may use taxation or SEBI-led directives to prevent systematic risk,\" said Sameer Mathur, MD and founder of Roinet Solution.\n\nIn September 2025 alone, silver ETFs attracted approximately Rs 36,500 crore, signalling a potential shift from “smart hedging” to retail FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). To avoid overheating, several major MFs temporarily halted fresh lump-sum investments in Silver Fund of Funds (FoFs) due to a high domestic premium.\n\nVarun Gupta, CEO - Groww Mutual Fund, said, \"We are seeing heightened inflows into silver ETFs, driven by recent price performance and silver’s increasing relevance in industrial applications such as renewable energy and EVs. As a result, silver ETF AUM in India crossed Rs 40,000 crore by October 25 and exceeded Rs 72,000 crore by the end of December 2025. However, commodities can be volatile, and flows linked purely to momentum may not always be durable.\"\n\nDomestic shortages led to silver trading at a premium in India compared to global prices. Geopolitical tensions have driven investors towards 'safe haven' commodities, but the rapid pace of the rally has raised concerns about a 'bubble' phase.\"\n\nMathur said, \"If the finance minister decides to act, the measure could include revised capital gains rules to discourage short-term speculative trading, enhanced disclosure requiring fund houses to provide clearer warnings about tracking error, and formalising the 'lump-sum' bans that may be imposed by a few fund houses.\n\nAny investor in silver ETFs / silver trading should be prepared for sharp corrections, as recent history shows that after massive rallies, regulators often step in, which can lead to a cooling-off period in prices.\n\nETFs fell in trading today as precious metals prices plunged following a record rally. The MCX silver price fell by Rs 80,000 from the record high. Analysts already projected that such an event might occur if growth were to be parabolic.\n\nMathur said, \"For investors, it is always better to diversify, avoiding concentrations of more than 5-10% in any single commodity, such as silver, given its high volatility.\"\n\n\"The regulatory framework for commodity ETFs in India is already fairly robust, and historically, policy actions — when taken — have focused on ensuring orderly market functioning and investor protection rather than restricting investor choice. Investors should be mindful of volatility and use silver as a measured allocation within a diversified portfolio,\" added Gupta.",

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey: 2025-26 was released at the back of unpredictable global economic order.  With major countries becoming increasingly inward looking and breaking the global value chains, countries like India trying to navigate through this changing global order and becoming, as per Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran’s words, increasingly ‘strategically indispensable’.\n\nIn this context, apart from making macro assessments for FY27, the Survey brings out many micro and process related reforms to overcome the global shocks that we have witnessed since beginning of 2025.\n\nGrowth will be sustained only through reforms\n\nTwo chapters that highlight the medium to long-term strategy in the Survey are one on industry and infrastructure investments.  The Survey argues that for reviving domestic drivers of growth there is a need to focus on structural transformation, productivity and competitiveness. While Indian industry has witnessed greater momentum with the growth rate of 6.2 per cent in 2025-26, with strong acceleration in manufacturing at 7 per cent., sustaining such high growth needs sustained reforms in many areas.\n\nThe Survey positions the industry sector as the one ready for its next big leap, with the backing of the continued thrust placed on infrastructure and logistics by the government.  In addition to this the support through Production Linked Incentives (PLI) schemes and other interventions such as the India Semiconductor Mission, combined by the focused approach towards strengthening the MSMEs changing the face of Indian industry.  All these measures are expected to reduce the cost of production.\n\nHowever, the Survey could have looked at this aspect little more in-depth whether these reforms have led to reduction in cost of production.\n\nA tech orientation to the diversification of industrial base\n\nThe Survey also highlights the developments in the Research & Development where government has taken a number of initiatives leading to a shift towards high technology manufacturing, as medium and high technology activities accounted for over 46 per cent of India’s total manufacturing value added. The Survey highlights that the most significant change in the recent period is the diversification of the industrial base to include tech-intensive segments.\n\nThe Survey argues that India needs to strengthen its backward linkages in the global value chains that will also improve export growth. As we navigate this path, strengthening export competitiveness along with reducing the excessive reliance on imports becomes crucial. In the changing global environment, the Survey argues, strategically placing oneself in the global value chain requires Swadeshi path.  The Survey deals the Swadeshi issue little more in-depth and argues that it is inevitable for India to adopt Swadeshi for four reasons: global order has changed, trade is no longer fair, markets no longer neutral, and supply chains have become state instruments.  Further, it provides a number of examples of how so many countries already adopting swadeshi.\n\nEmployment-intensity of industrialization needed more focus\n\nLast Union Budget, while assessing the PLI scheme, it has shifted its focus to Employment Linked Incentive (ELI) scheme as any growth in industry should also need to be employment generating.  However, the Survey, although there is a separate chapter on employment, doesn’t delve enough on this aspect in the context of industrialisation.   This is especially so as the transition that the industry undergoing it needs to generate more employment.  One of the special themes of the Survey is Artificial Intelligence (AI).  However, the Survey could have engaged analytically on the impact of AI on employment.\n\nOn the infrastructure, the Survey extensively discusses the consistent push given by the Union government towards infrastructure, which has significantly strengthened connectivity. However, one must study more on its broad spillovers to completely understand its outcome. Investments in infrastructure which has been a continued priority of the Union government has harnessed its benefits through better connectivity among the urban centres, through shorter travel time, particularly helping quicker freight movements along with the last mile connectivity taking on board the rural centres. The Survey suggest that with improvement in ease of doing business, there has been a better participation from the private sector under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) models. However, the Survey could have highlighted that success of PPP model is limited only to few and not across all the infrastructure sectors.\n\nDomestic savings needs attention\n\nThe Survey, while arguing that the India’s potential GDP growth has improved from 6.5 to 7 per cent, suggest that key reforms that encompass industry and infrastructure have played a major role in enhancing potential growth.  And this could be through larger multiplier effect expected from public investments.  Here it highlights three aspects for this improvement: improvement in capital accumulation; labor market reforms; and improvement in productivity.\n\nWith an investment rate of 30 per cent, potential growth of 7 per cent requires substantial productivity improvement.  The Survey argues that with digital public infrastructure and with increased focus on regulatory simplifications as well as with efficiency gains, the productivity is expected to improve.\n\nIn the case of capital accumulation, as it is largely dependent on domestic savings and is declining over the years, there is need to focus on measures to revive the domestic savings.  Many studies have suggested that India need to enhance its investment rate atleast by 2 to 3 per cent to achieve 7 to 8 per cent growth for Viksit Bharat.  This needs more domestic savings. Else, this would also have implications on the external account as well as rupee value.  Bearing this limitation on the external account, in all, the Survey presents an optimistic picture about the Indian economy and backs with very convincing arguments as well as policy initiatives.\n\n(Blessy Augustine is anAssistant Professor and N R Bhanumurthy is Director of the Madras School of Economics.)\n\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "The rupee has slipped to fresh lows in recent months, extending a phase of underperformance despite India posting one of its strongest macroeconomic runs in decades.\n\nCurrency pressures have intensified amid volatile global capital flows, heightened geopolitical risks, and a sharp reassessment of risk by global investors, even as growth remains robust and inflation largely contained.\n\nIn calendar 2025 and this January, the rupee weakened as foreign portfolio flows turned intermittent and India’s balance of payments came under strain. Persistent merchandise trade deficits, coupled with periods of capital outflows, have weighed on the currency, pushing it to levels that many economists say do not reflect India’s underlying economic strength.\n\nAccording toBloombergdata, the domestic currency is down by 2.22 percent, so far in January . So far in the current financial year, the local currency is down by 7.02 percent. On January 30, it was trading at 91.9512 against the US dollar.\n\n“The INR depreciation reflects capital outflows with BoP (balance of payment) turning significantly negative in Q2-Q3FY26. The RBI's ability to defend the currency is limited by a large forward book. The latter limits its ability to sterilise intervention,” said Gaura Sengupta, Economist at IDFC First Bank.\n\nThe Economic Survey 2025-26 acknowledges this divergence bluntly, noting that “the Indian rupee underperformed in 2025”, even as growth momentum stayed strong .\n\nThe survey explains that India’s dependence on foreign capital to finance its external gap leaves the currency vulnerable when global risk appetite fades. “India runs a trade deficit in goods… When (foreign capital flows) run drier, rupee stability becomes a casualty.”\n\nWhat makes the recent depreciation striking, the survey argues, is that it comes at a time when most domestic macro indicators are supportive. “Growth is good; the outlook remains favourable; inflation is contained… banks are healthy; liquidity conditions are comfortable,” it says, adding that “the rupee’s valuation does not accurately reflect India’s stellar economic fundamentals”\n\nIn a notable phrase, the survey characterises the currency as being undervalued, stating that “the rupee, therefore, is punching below its weight.” It concedes that a weaker rupee offers some near-term insulation, helping exporters and offsetting the impact of higher US tariffs, while noting there is currently “no threat of higher inflation from higher-priced crude oil imports.”\n\nHowever, the survey also flags the downside. Persistent weakness in the currency, it warns, can dampen investor confidence. “It does cause investors to pause. Investor reluctance to commit to India warrants examination,” it says\n\nThe survey strikes a cautious note on currency stability. In an increasingly fragmented global order marked by geopolitical tensions and financial volatility, it warns that disruptions to capital flows could become a recurring risk. “In all three scenarios, India is relatively better off than most other countries… but this does not guarantee insulation,” it notes, adding that capital-flow shocks could have a “consequent impact on the rupee.”",

However, buying interest in the second half helped the Nifty recover to close above 25,300, near the day’s high.\n\nAt close, the Sensex was down 296.59 points or 0.36 percent at 82,269.78, and the Nifty was down 98.25 points or 0.39 percent at 25,320.65.\n\nThe broader indices ended mixed, with the Nifty Midcap index slipping 0.2%, while the Smallcap index gained 0.3%.\n\nFor the week, BSE Sensex and Nifty50 indices rose 1 percent each.\n\nAlso Read:Gold, silver ETFs crash up to 14% as precious metals tumble from record highs: Should you buy?\n\nHindalco, Tata Steel, Coal India, ONGC, ICICI Bank were among major losers on the Nifty, while gainers were Tata Consumer, Apollo Hospitals, Nestle, M&M, ITC.\n\nAmong sectors, metal index shed 5%, oil & gas, Bank, IT, Energy shed 0.5-1%, while pharma, media, consumer durables, FMCG rose 0.7-1.8%.\n\nIn stock specifics, South Indian Bank shares crashed 15% as CEO doesn’t seek reappointment, Swiggy shares price fell 4% as consolidated losses increase, Paytm shares fell 3% despite company reports profit in Q3, ACME Solar shares rose 4% after signing power purchase agreement (PPA) with NHPC, Capri Global share price shed 2.5% even as Q3 profit jumps 99.5%, NTPC Green Energy share price declined 6.5% after profit slips 73%.

The BSE midcap and the small cap indices outperformed the larger peers. BSE Metals (commodity rally), capital goods (budget expectation) and Oil & Gas (rise in oil price) were the major gainers in this week, whereas BSE Auto index (reacted to India EU FTA) witnessed correction.\n\nThe INR (vs USD) that has been weakening in recent weeks, hit fresh record lows this week. Oil prices have been climbing sharply in this week — with Brent crude and WTI hitting multi-month highs on rising geopolitical risk. From India’s perspective, sharp increase in oil prices can fuel inflation, put pressure on currency and widen the current account deficit.\n\nThe Indian market witnessed a decent Q3FY26 earnings season, with aggregate earnings marginally ahead of expectations until now.

The index found strong intraday support twice in the 25220–25210 zone and staged a smart recovery towards the last hour. However, it closed the day at 25,321, down 0.39% for the day. After bouncing off its 200-day EMA in the previous session, Nifty failed to see meaningful follow-through and ended the day trading inside the prior day’s range.\n\nGoing ahead, the immediate resistance for Nifty is placed in the 25,450–25,500 zone, with the Index failing to decisively close above this zone after attempting twice in the last six sessions. A decisive breakout above this zone could result in Nifty extending its pullback towards 25,650, followed by 25,800 in the near term. On the downside, the 200-day EMA zone of 25,200–25,150 zone is likely to act as a strong support.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "Samuel Beckett’s absurdist play 'Waiting for Godot' shows the futility of waiting for the future with hope. While nihilistic, it would strike a chord with many Indians who have had a brush with the justice system. In fact, several of our institutions are guilty of taking too long to dispense with resolutions in the name of accuracy and thoroughness in procedure.\n\nLook how our prized reform Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is faringhere. The time taken for a resolution to just get your money back from a defunct company is not less than two years. Criminal justice court cases take a decade to reach a verdict and even consumer courts give out rulings quickly in rare cases. For any individual or a firm mired in procedure, resolution and restitution demand an exorbitant sunk cost.\n\nWhile institutions and systems are turtle-slow, capital is impatient. That is the reason the predictions of a surge of foreign investors in India’s junk assets market didn’t live up to the hype -- private credit is still dominated by already existing foreign investors and domestic players. The impatience of capital can be seen even in the microfinance sector where private equity thrusts business targets, sometimes lofty, onto microfinance lenders in the name of outreach to exit at a juicy valuation that such a growth brings.\n\nYet another set of impatient investors is in the bond markets. Imagine being given a free ticket to a party guaranteed to be fun filled and refusing it. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has thrown in rate cuts, large liquidity infusions, and outright purchases of bonds at the market, but nothing has stuck. Bond yields are still elevated because no matter how much the central bank buys, there is always more coming down thestate government pipe. For investors, the sovereign must offer more if it wants their money.\n\nIn a Trumpian world, we have been witnesses to impatience of unprecedented scale. Foreign investors want nothing to do with Indian equities even when it is dressed in perhaps the best macroeconomic performance in many years. Dollars are flying off everyday to find newer lucrative shores as America under President Trump recasts global trade.\n\nIf Indian policymakers had walked the path that says success comes to those who wait, Indian markets would have been far worse off today. For once the RBI cannot be accused of doing too little too late on liquidity or interest rates. The central government too has done its bit throughout this fiscal year, from income tax reductions to goods and services tax revamp that fuelled consumption.\n\nInvestors are hoping that the Union Budget on Sunday will continue to show that it has got their backs. Ananya Royin her column here, lists what are these expectations that are priced in the markets today. Indeed, stock market investors are willing to work on a Sunday rather than wait 24 hours to place their bets on the Budget announcements. There is no regard for delayed gratification here because capital is impatient, always.\n\nThat brings us to a rather cheeky section of the Economic Survey titled 'Delayed gratification and the cost of impatience'. The survey censures Indian citizens on their impatience with state machinery and policy in developmental work. Manas Chakravarty lays bare the Survey’s delusional lament about this impatiencein his column hereand argues that Indians are impatient because institutions do not deliver on time. “When contract enforcement takes a decade, delayed gratification becomes economically irrational,” he points out. The Survey errors in painting institutional failure as a cultural failing.\n\nWe started with saying that it takes more than two years of time for creditors to get money back from a defaulting company and why capital won’t stay that long. When capital is impatient, why shouldn’t people be? To be fair, patient capital earns more and there are the likes of gurus such as Warren Buffett who support patient investing, also called value investing. But when patience becomes an exercise akin to waiting for Godot who never arrives, the whole approach is futile.\n\nInvesting insights from our research team\n\nIDBI Bank disinvestment – How much could a potential bidder pay for the bank?\n\nWeekly Tactical Pick: Why you should look at this infrastructure bellwether\n\nSwiggy Q3 FY26: Strong growth, profitability still a challenge\n\nMas Financial Q3 FY26: the earnings quality is noteworthy\n\nTata Motors: Growth momentum gains speed\n\nDabur Q3FY26: Consumption tailwinds to steer growth trajectory\n\nITC Q3FY26: Business mix to aid profitability amid tax headwinds\n\nDixon Technologies Q3 FY26: Industry headwinds drive near-term softness\n\nAcutaas Chemicals: Next fiscal to see traction in new businesses\n\nBudget Snapshot: How states are messing up the sovereign’s debt market standing\n\nThe Economic Survey's delayed gratification delusion\n\nWhat's priced in, and what could move markets, post Budget 2026?\n\nHow the Budget can help India capitalise on Trump’s tariff self-goal\n\nWaaree’s bet on clean energy value chain is necessary, but not without risks\n\nPersonal Finance: Why you must think about retirement planning\n\nEmerging markets make roaring start to 2026 as dollar slides(republished from the FT)\n\nWhat to Expect from India’s Budget 2026: Insights from the Economic Survey\n\nEconomic Survey shines the light on growth in times of external uncertainty\n\nEconomic Survey emphasises building strategic influence\n\nIndia’s next competitiveness test is input costs, not incentives\n\nEconomic Survey highlights a new vision for tech sovereignty in India\n\nTechnical Picks:GAIL,NOCIL, GRSE, GOLDBEES",

        "full_content": "For most people, retirement anxiety isn’t about returns. It’s about certainty. Will there be a steady monthly income when the salary stops? Will basic expenses still be covered, no matter what markets do?\n\nThat’s where annuity plans come in. They aren’t exciting, and they aren’t meant to be. Their job is simple: to convert a lump sum into predictable income for life or for a fixed period.\n\nSo what exactly is an annuity?\n\nAn annuity is a financial product, usually bought from an insurance company, where you pay a lump sum upfront and receive regular income in return. This income can start immediately or after a few years, depending on the plan you choose.\n\nThink of it as creating your own pension. You hand over capital, and in exchange, you get monthly, quarterly, or annual payouts that you can rely on.\n\nAnnuities appeal to people who value stability over flexibility. If market-linked investments rise and fall, annuities stay boringly steady.\n\nThey are often used to cover non-negotiable expenses in retirement: groceries, utilities, basic healthcare, rent or maintenance. Once those are taken care of, other investments can be allowed to fluctuate without causing panic.\n\nIn short, annuities buy peace of mind, not high returns.\n\nThe main types of annuity plans\n\nImmediate annuities start paying income almost right away, usually within a month or a year of investment. These are popular with retirees who already have a lump sum from provident fund, gratuity, or NPS and want income immediately.\n\nDeferred annuities start payouts later. You invest today, let the amount grow for a few years, and then begin receiving income at a chosen age. These work better for people who are still a few years away from retirement.\n\nLife annuities pay income for as long as you live. Some stop when you pass away, while others continue to a spouse. The longer the guarantee, the lower the monthly payout tends to be.\n\nAnnuities with return of purchase price give your nominee the original amount back after your death. This provides comfort to families but usually reduces the income slightly.\n\nHow to choose the right annuity for you\n\nThe first question to ask isn’t about rates. It’s about purpose.\n\nHow much guaranteed income do you need every month to feel secure? Not your lifestyle spends, just the essentials.\n\nOnce that number is clear, look at annuities as a way to fill that gap. Many retirees don’t put all their savings into annuities. They use them to cover basics and keep the rest invested for growth and flexibility.\n\nAlso consider whether you need income only for yourself or for a spouse as well. Joint-life annuities matter a lot in households where one partner may outlive the other by many years.\n\nAnnuities are mostly irreversible. Once you buy one, you can’t usually exit without losing value. That’s why timing matters.\n\nReturns are fixed at the time of purchase. If interest rates rise later, your annuity doesn’t change. This is why many people stagger annuity purchases instead of investing everything at once.\n\nTaxation also matters. Annuity income is taxed as regular income. This should be factored into how much you actually need to receive post-tax.\n\nThe role annuities should play\n\nAnnuities are not meant to replace all retirement planning. They are meant to remove fear from it.\n\nUsed wisely, they create a stable base so that you’re not forced to sell investments during bad market years or worry about monthly cash flow in your 70s or 80s.\n\nThey won’t make you rich. But they can make retirement feel predictable, and for many people, that’s worth far more.\n\nThe right annuity isn’t the one with the highest payout. It’s the one that lets you sleep better, knowing that some income will keep coming no matter what.",

        "full_content": "Defence shares advanced on Friday, with the sectoral index logging its biggest weekly gain since May 2025, amid expectations of higher capital outlay in the upcoming Union Budget on February 1.\n\nThe Nifty India Defence Index rose over 1.5 percent to an intraday high of 8,193.50. The index is up 8.9 percent so far this week, marking its strongest weekly rise since May 2025, when India-Pakistan border tensions had flared.\n\nThe rally comes ahead of the Union Budget, with analysts expecting a substantial increase in defence capital spending.\n\nOm Ghawalkar, Market Analyst, Share.Market (PhonePe Wealth), noted \"the Nifty India Defence Index is flashing strong bullish signals as it prepares for a major breakout from a Double Bottom pattern. Currently trading at 8,184, the index has gained 8% this week, significantly outperforming the broader market. This momentum is supported by a Golden Crossover, where the 10-day and 21-day moving averages have climbed above the medium-term trend, confirming a new uptrend. With a rising MACD and prices holding well above all key moving averages, the technical setup suggests that buyers are firmly in control.\"\n\n\"The index's strength is further highlighted by its position relative to long-term trend lines. It is currently trading comfortably above its 50-day SMA and its 200-day SMA, which indicates a robust primary trend. The recent \"Golden Crossover\" specifically saw the short-term averages move past the 100-day SMA, providing a clear technical \"buy\" signal for momentum traders looking at the medium-term horizon. Looking ahead, the index faces immediate hurdles at 8,350 and 8,450. A clean break above these resistance levels could trigger a fresh rally toward previous record highs. On the downside, the 7,300–7,400 zone provides a solid support floor, protecting against sudden volatility. As the Union Budget 2026 approaches on February 1, this pre-budget momentum highlights the sector's strength and its role as a key growth theme for investors in the current market.\n\nHemant Sood, Managing Director, Findoc, said \"The sharp rally in defence stocks reflects strong investor expectations of a higher defence allocation in the upcoming Union Budget, driven largely by evolving global geopolitical tensions and rising security concerns. With ongoing international conflicts, markets are factoring in increased focus on defence preparedness and modernization.\"\n\n\"Within the sector, aerial combat technologies and drone manufacturing are likely to remain key beneficiaries, as next-generation warfare increasingly relies on surveillance, automation, and advanced combat systems. Additionally, defence PSU stocks are expected to stay in focus, given their direct linkage to government spending and execution. From a valuation standpoint, defence stocks are not excessively stretched, which further supports the ongoing momentum. Overall, a favourable budgetary push, combined with strategic importance and reasonable valuations, is driving sustained investor interest in the defence space,\" he added.\n\nAccording to Emkay Research, recent geopolitical developments leave the government with limited flexibility, necessitating higher defence outlays. The brokerage has forecast a 12–13 percent year-on-year growth in defence spending over the next three to four years. Nuvama Institutional Equities also expects the Budget to accelerate spending in the sector.\n\nMacquarie said India could raise defence expenditure to 2.5 percent of GDP by fiscal 2027 from 1.9 percent in the current fiscal, with a sharper focus on indigenisation. The defence index has gained 5.15 percent so far in January, compared with a 3.3 percent decline in the benchmark Nifty 50.\n\nThe Nifty India Defence Index had fallen 1.2 percent in the previous session but recovered those losses on Friday. All its 18 constituents were trading in the green.\n\nDynamatic Technologiesemerged as the top gainer, rising 8 percent to Rs 8,790 per share.Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineersand MTAR Technologies followed, advancing 7.37 percent and 7.19 percent, respectively.\n\nMTAR Technologies reported a strong performance in the December quarter, supported by healthy execution across segments and operating leverage. The company’s net profit more than doubled to Rs 34.6 crore in the third quarter of FY26 from Rs 15.9 crore a year ago, while revenue rose 56.9 percent year-on-year to Rs 273.7 crore. EBITDA jumped 80.7 percent to Rs 59.8 crore, with operating margin improving to 22 percent from 19 percent in the corresponding quarter last year.\n\n\"GRSE is mirroring the Nifty Defence Index’s bullish structure, currently trading at ₹2,764. Technically, the stock is primed for an uptrend as it forms a Double Bottom pattern with strong volume accumulation. While ₹2,100 serves as a solid support floor, the stock faces its next major test at the ₹3,000 psychological resistance level. MTAR Technologies is witnessing a powerful technical breakout, surging past the critical Rs 2,700 resistance to reach Rs 2,931. This move is validated by a massive volume spike and a bullish MACD crossover, signaling that the stock has shifted from consolidation to an aggressive growth phase. Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders is showing early signs of a bullish reversal as it successfully closed above its 50-day moving average this week,\" added Ghawalkar.\n\nShares of Paras Defence and Space Technologies, Cochin Shipyard, Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, Bharat Electronics and Hindustan Aeronautics also gained up to 3 percent.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "Shriram Finance is targeting 15 percent AUM growth in FY26, with potential upside to 16-17 percent, as improving economic momentum, GST reforms and resilient rural demand continue to support credit expansion, Umesh Revankar, Executive Vice Chairman said.\n\nSpeaking to Moneycontrol after the company’s Q3 FY26 earnings, Revankar said the lender is “working towards” the higher growth range, reflecting confidence in the operating environment while maintaining a cautious and calibrated outlook.\n\nHe linked the company’s performance directly to India’s GDP growth, noting that economic expansion has had a positive impact across both urban and rural markets, with rural demand emerging as the stronger driver. This macroeconomic tailwind has translated into steady operating performance for the lender.\n\nFinancially, the momentum was reflected in the numbers. Revenue grew 14.6 percent, while adjusted net profit rose 51 percent, after normalising for the one-time impact of the housing finance company sale in the same quarter last year. The company also reported improved margins, lower interest costs and stronger asset quality, with credit costs and Stage 3 assets (both gross and net) showing improvement.\n\nThe business mix continues to be supported by structurally strong mobility demand. Passenger vehicles (PV) have grown materially faster than the overallloanbook, driven by two distinct demand patterns, which is private mobility demand rising in rural markets, and public mobility demand concentrated in urban centres, supported by higher demand for cabs, buses and transport services amid limited state government spending on public transport infrastructure.\n\nCommercial vehicles (CVs), which account for around 46 percent of AUM, remain Sriram Finance’s core franchise. While passenger vehicle financing will continue to scale, the company intends to accelerate CV growth beyond 15 percent, compared to the current 12–14 percent range.\n\nOn the strategic front, the entry of MUFG as a 20 percent shareholder marks a long-term shift in capital strategy. Instead of incremental fundraising through QIPs or rights issues, the company opted for a global strategic partner to support growth, strengthen risk and technology capabilities, and build long-term competitiveness, particularly against banks.\n\nRevankar said the capital raised will be primarily deployed for business expansion and customer retention, as Sriram Finance looks to consolidate its position in India’s structurally expanding credit market.\n\nAt an organisational level, the group is also moving towards structural simplification, with lending businesses consolidated under Sriram Finance and non-lending businesses, such as insurance, structured separately.",

        "full_content": "Thematic and sectoral funds often arrive wrapped in a compelling narrative. Defence spending is rising. Manufacturing is shifting to India. Electric vehicles are the future. Banking will always grow with the economy. Compared to broad, diversified funds, these products feel sharper and more intentional, as though you are aligning your money with the future rather than the past.\n\nThat appeal is real. So is the risk.\n\nWhat these funds actually invest in\n\nSectoral funds restrict themselves to a single sector such as IT, pharma, financials, energy, or metals. Thematic funds cast a slightly wider net, but they are still built around one idea. A theme like infrastructure, digitalisation, or manufacturing may cut across sectors, but it is still a concentrated bet.\n\nThe key point is this: neither type has the freedom to move away when conditions change. A diversified equity fund can reduce exposure to a struggling sector and increase exposure to a stronger one. A sectoral or thematic fund cannot. Its mandate locks it in.\n\nWhy returns can look spectacular at the right time\n\nWhen a sector or theme is in favour, these funds often outperform sharply. Earnings momentum, policy support, and positive news flow combine to push stock prices up together. Because the portfolio is concentrated, those gains show up clearly in fund performance.\n\nThis is usually when interest peaks. New funds are launched. Existing funds see inflows. Past returns are highlighted. For many investors, this creates a sense that they are “late but not too late.”\n\nIn reality, this is often the most dangerous entry point.\n\nSectors and themes are cyclical. They move in long waves shaped by policy, global demand, interest rates, regulation, and technology. What looks like a permanent shift can slow down or reverse.\n\nWhen that happens, these funds don’t gradually underperform. They can stagnate for years. Returns flatten. Relative performance looks disappointing. Investors lose patience and exit, often near the bottom of the cycle.\n\nThis boom-bust pattern is common across themes, from infrastructure to commodities to technology.\n\nTiming matters more than discipline\n\nWith diversified equity funds, long holding periods smooth out a lot of mistakes. Time compensates for imperfect timing. With sectoral and thematic funds, time alone is not enough. Entry and exit matter far more.\n\nMost retail investors are not good at this. They tend to buy after strong performance and sell after disappointment. In a concentrated fund, that behaviour gap can destroy returns even if the long-term theme eventually plays out.\n\nWhere these funds can fit sensibly\n\nThematic and sectoral funds work best as satellite holdings, not as the core of a portfolio. They make sense when you already have broad equity exposure and want to express a specific, measured view with a small portion of your money.\n\nThey also suit investors who can tolerate long periods of underperformance without reacting. If a fund doing poorly for three or four years would make you uncomfortable, this category will test your patience.\n\nWhat to check before investing\n\nIt’s worth examining how tightly the fund sticks to its mandate, how diversified it is within the theme, and how it has behaved across market cycles. Just as important is clarity on why you’re investing. Is it because the story sounds convincing, or because it plays a defined role in your portfolio?\n\nThese funds demand more self-awareness than most people expect.\n\nA more useful way to frame the decision\n\nInstead of asking whether a theme is “the future,” ask how much of your portfolio you are willing to tie to that future being right, and being right within a certain time frame.\n\nIf the answer is “most of it,” the risk is probably too high.\n\nThematic and sectoral funds are neither heroes nor villains. They are precision tools. Used sparingly, they can add returns and express conviction. Used casually or emotionally, they often disappoint.\n\nThe real danger isn’t that these funds exist. It’s forgetting that a good story is not the same thing as a resilient investment strategy.",

        "full_content": "Active investing can feel exhausting. You worry about constant fund switches, performance comparisons, timing decisions, and about whether you picked the “right” manager. Passive investing appeals precisely because it steps away from all that.\n\nAt its core, passive investing is about accepting a simple idea: most investors don’t need to outsmart the market to meet their goals. They just need steady exposure to it, at low cost, over long periods.\n\nWhat passive investing really means\n\nPassive investing doesn’t mean doing nothing. It means choosing investments that track a market index instead of trying to outperform it. Index funds and exchange-traded funds are the most common tools here. They mirror an index, hold the same stocks in roughly the same proportion, and don’t rely on a fund manager’s calls.\n\nBecause there’s less buying and selling and no star manager involved, costs stay low. Over time, those lower costs can make a surprisingly big difference to returns.\n\nMarkets, especially broad ones, already reflect the combined knowledge and expectations of millions of participants. Trying to consistently beat that is harder than it sounds. Data across markets shows that many actively managed funds struggle to outperform their benchmarks over long periods, especially after fees.\n\nPassive investing sidesteps this problem. You don’t need to predict which stocks or sectors will shine next year. You simply participate in the market’s overall growth.\n\nThis approach works particularly well for long-term goals like retirement, children’s education, or wealth accumulation over decades.\n\nHow to start building a passive portfolio\n\nThe easiest way to begin is with a broad market index fund. This gives you instant diversification across large companies, without needing to analyse individual stocks.\n\nOnce that base is in place, you can add a second layer over time. Some investors include a mid-cap or total market index fund for broader exposure. Others add a bond or debt index fund to reduce volatility as their goals get closer.\n\nYou don’t need many funds. In fact, one of the strengths of passive investing is how simple it stays. Two or three well-chosen index funds are often enough for most portfolios.\n\nA common misconception is that you need to “enter at the right time”. With passive investing, discipline matters far more than timing.\n\nUsing systematic investment plans helps smooth out market ups and downs. You invest regularly, regardless of headlines, and let time do the heavy lifting. This also removes emotion from the process, which is where many investors stumble.\n\nWhat passive investing won’t do\n\nPassive investing won’t give you bragging rights at dinner parties. There will always be someone who picked a stock that doubled faster. And in certain years, actively managed funds may outperform.\n\nThe trade-off is consistency and peace of mind. Passive investing is designed to help you reach your goals reliably, not chase the best possible outcome in any single year.\n\nIt also requires patience. The real benefits show up over long stretches, not months.\n\nKeep costs, taxes and behaviour in check\n\nCosts are one of the few things investors can control. Even a small difference in expense ratios compounds over time. Similarly, frequent buying and selling can create tax inefficiencies that quietly eat into returns.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, passive investing works best when you leave it alone. Resist the urge to tinker every time markets fall or surge. Review your portfolio periodically, rebalance if needed, and then step back.\n\nPassive investing is not about lowering ambition. It’s about choosing a strategy that matches how real markets behave and how real people live.\n\nIf you’re looking for a calm, low-maintenance way to build wealth, starting with a simple passive portfolio may be one of the smartest financial decisions you make.",

Operating margin improved to 12.60 percent in Q3 FY26 from 12.07 percent in Q3 FY25, while profit margin reduced to 3.23 percent.\n\nTata Motors reported a 30 bps increase in consolidated EBITDA to 12.5 percent during the October-December quarter of the ongoing FY26.\n\nMotilal Oswal said that the firm’s Q3 results missed estimates, led by input cost pressures. The automaker’s Q3 profit was below the domestic brokerage’s expectations due to lower-than-expected margin at 12.8 percent.\n\n“The key concern for TMCV has been its gradual loss of market share across key segments. Further, its recent acquisition of Iveco would expose it to the ongoing global macro uncertainties, thereby driving a potential de-rating, if demand does not improve anytime soon. We have already factored in a pickup in domestic CV demand in our estimates (we estimate 9% volume CAGR over FY25-28E). We also factor in margins to remain stable at 13% over FY25-28E,” Motilal said.\n\nHowever, the brokerage added that the stock appears to be fairly valued now after a recent rally. It remained ‘Neutral’ on the stock, with a target price of Rs 431 apiece, which implies an upside potential of more than 8 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.\n\nEmkay Global said that the firm’s net profit beat its estimate mainly on account of lower-than-expected tax expense. “We believe the overall CV demand environment remains constructive, with double-digit growth likely to sustain till H1FY27 – TMCV should lead this multi-year upcycle in our view,” it said.\n\nThe firm retained its ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 650 apiece, which implies an upside potential of more than 38 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.\n\nJM Financial said that rising commodity prices are expected to have impact on margins in Q4 FY26. “To partly offset this, the company has implemented a 1% price hike effective 1st Jan’26, while a potential moderation in discount intensity could provide additional support to the margins,” it said.\n\nThe brokerage kept a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 550 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 17 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "State-run Indian Oil Corporation will continue to purchase crude based on what makes commercial sense rather than discounts or geopolitical considerations, its chairman and managing director, Arvinder Singh Sahney, told Moneycontrol in an interview. The comments come as the country’s largest refiner lays out a strategy to diversify its sourcing base amid a volatile global oil market. The company has further identified land parcels for its nuclear energy projects and is in discussions with various states for the same. For its nuclear foray, the company is on the lookout for global partners to collaborate in the segment.\n\n1) How does the company plan to navigate the current geopolitical situation with US sanctions on Russian oil and a potential stabilisation of Venezuela’s oil sector? Do you plan to increase your sourcing of Venezuelan crude grades?\n\nWe procure crude purely on commercial considerations. Whichever grade is commercially beneficial for us, we will go for it. Expanding our crude basket has been a consistent priority: five years ago, we were sourcing from around 27 geographies; today, we source from 41. That effort will continue.\n\nAnyone is welcome if crude is available. Several refineries, across both the private sector and PSUs, are capable of processing a wide range of crude types.\n\n2) There’s a rebalancing underway in oil and gas, and data shows Russian imports have been declining for some refiners. Given the volatility, does IOC also plan to cut Russia sourcing and shift to more stable origins?\n\nWe rely on economic models to make those calls. If a crude stream works commercially for us, we take it; if it doesn’t, we don’t. It’s not just about a headline discount. The crude has to run through our refineries, and each grade comes with its own processing cost and yields a different product slate with different realisations.\n\nSo the optimisation is end-to-end, crude price, refining costs, product yields, and net margins. We run this through complex, AI-driven modelling, and we follow what the model output tells us is optimal now.\n\nThe environment is changing quickly. Crude prices have moved up again. Not long ago, we were looking at around $58 a barrel. In a market like this, decisions have to be dynamic, prudent, and commercially sound.\n\nWe will buy crude that makes commercial sense. Discounts matter, but they are only one factor, not the only one.\n\nKpler data point (context): IOC’s Russian crude imports in the first 23 days of 2026 were about 468 kbd, nearly matching the 470 kbd it averaged over all of 2023, indicating a sharp pickup at the start of this year.\n\n3) The three OMCs have concluded a one-year deal for imports of LPG from the US in 2026. When do you see the supply starting and are there any other regions you are looking to source LNG or LPG from?\n\nLPG is primarily available in these two regions only, either in the US or in the Gulf. We have taken up a conscious decision to diversify to a certain extent. The US LPG supply will start from April. We will always be on the lookout for good deals.\n\n4) Does the company plan to enter the nuclear segment?\n\nWe are evaluating it. As you know, we are one of only two companies in the country with a long-standing joint venture with NPCIL. NTPC has already moved ahead with some projects, and we are assessing how we should proceed, including land identification and the facilities required.\n\nWith the latest SHANTI Bill and the regulations that will follow, we expect more competitive proposals from foreign technology providers and potential collaborators. We are looking for the right partner.\n\nWe have identified a few states for potential nuclear projects and are in discussions with them.\n\n5) What is your capex target for this and the next fiscal?\n\nWe have been doing a capex of Rs 35-40,000 crore per year. It will be in the same range for FY27 too.\n\n6) What are your key priority areas in the renewable energy segment? How much RE capacity are you targeting?\n\nIn renewables, we’re building across the spectrum, solar, wind, CBG, 3G ethanol, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and green hydrogen.\n\nWe are setting up what will be India’s largest green hydrogen plant, with capacity of 10,000 tonnes per annum, targeted to be ready by December 2027. We are also the only company in the country with a licence to produce and dispense SAF, and we expect SAF dispensing to begin by June 2026.\n\nOverall, we are targeting 18 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030.\n\n7) What were the key discussions during the CEO roundtable with the prime minister during the India Energy Week?\n\nKey discussions were that we were encouraged to go for transitional pathways because we have been inculcating that dialogue that we have to work on non-fossil forms of energy. So he has encouraged that. And at the same time, he has said that we have to improve on upstream, we have to look for ways and means where we can, we can increase our in-house production of crude, plus he has encouraged us to work on improving our supply chains. He has given emphasis on the gas economy. He has given emphasis on Make in India and how we can increase production of petrochemicals, chemicals, and gas usage. He emphasised on how we can give more and more emphasis on improving the cost structure of our supply chain.",

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey’s observations on compute and AI portend potentially significant developments in the upcoming Budget. First, it flags concerns raised by theFinancial Timesabout off-balance-sheet leverage in global AI investments, alongside skepticism expressed by IBM’s CEO regarding the financial viability of large-scale data center expansion. Second, it highlights that the demands data centers place on water, energy, and finance may be difficult to reconcile with India’s economic and existential realities, where steady access to these basic amenities is still not universal. Taken together, these signals suggest that Budget 2026 is unlikely to offer subsidies or major outlays for data centers. This presents a unique opportunity for India to reimagine its conception of technological sovereignty.\n\nIn a digital economy typified by cross-border and multi-directional data flows, technological sovereignty need not hinge on physical localisation, but on predictability. Until now, the idea of technological sovereignty in India has largely meant building as much as possible domestically, and forcing localization where it was not. Ratcheting up the number of home-grown data centers fed into this vision.\n\nThe goal of localisation was understandable. They were originally driven by a quest for seamless access to data for law enforcement, which was often stymied by an antiquated and broken international data-sharing regime under Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties. They continue to be reinforced by anti-globalist sentiments, both at home and internationally.\n\nHowever, these sentiments render the quest for self-reliance incompatible with the nature of digital flows today. Digital information flows cannot be reduced to a zero-sum game, where data moving into or out of a country is viewed as a net loss or gain.\n\nIndia's Digital Ecosystem and Global Synergies\n\nResearch has shown, for instance, that large digital platforms create significant opportunities for Indian MSMEs, in terms of both revenue generation and customer acquisition, domestically as well as internationally. The network through which a domestic firm reaches a global customer may be foreign, but the service provided is wholly Indian. Similar mutualism exists across the AI stack. While infrastructure and models may originate with international or domestic firms, Indian companies are the ones building applications on top of them.\n\nHere again, research shows thatfirms derive value from multiplicity in AI infrastructureand are careful to avoid lock-in to any single architecture. Data gathered by the Esya Centre from start-ups indicates that AI developersroutinely multi-home across clouds and models—an effective way to limit capital intensity while still capturing the benefits of advanced infrastructure.\n\nLessons for Start-up Ecosystem\n\nThese synergies are often ignored when technological sovereignty is reduced to a static ledger of national credits and debits, where outward digital flows are automatically treated as a loss to the national interest rather than as an enabler of economic value and global integration.\n\nA reimagined conception of technological sovereignty for India must begin with trust. Businesses value certainty, even more so in a global environment marked by policy volatility and erratic decision-making. Singapore offers a useful illustration. Despite its small size, it has emerged as the second-largest innovation hub in Asia and ninth globally, attracting start-ups from around the world, including India.\n\nA 2022 report by the Asian Development Bank notes that thisinflux has been driven by startup- and investor-friendly policies, alongside an unwavering commitment to the rule of law. Tax certainty—including the absence of capital gains tax on investments—combined with a co-investment model in which the government invested alongside venture funds, helped crowd in private capital. Importantly, this approach also allowed the state to leverage the market expertise and risk-assessment capabilities of private investors, who are often better positioned than government agencies to evaluate fast-moving technology sectors.\n\nProximity to capital, coupled with clear and credible rules of the road, in turn drew start-ups to Singapore’s ecosystem. There is also evidence to suggest that investors themselves encouraged firms to relocate or incorporate there, so they could benefit from the legal and institutional assurances offered by a stable jurisdiction.\n\nIndia could orient itself in a similar direction. Doing so, however, requires resisting the temptation to dilute or reverse institutional and legal commitments once made. Episodes such as the Tiger Global dispute are one example, but more recent decisions—such as accelerating the compliance timeline for certain entities under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act from 18 months to 12—also raise concerns. Data protection frameworks are complex to implement, and most jurisdictions globally have allowed at least two years for compliance with comparable regimes.\n\nNavigating AI Regulation with Trust and Predictability\n\nIn the context of AI, the Economic Survey rightly notes that India must still determine how best to regulate the technology. Here too, trust should serve as the lodestar. This implies avoiding unnecessary compliance burdens or reactionary rule-making—such as the advisory issued in March 2024 that sought toeffectively impose a licensing regimeon all generative AI systems.\n\nTrust enables digital flows through a country, and these flows enable the capture of value. This should be the modern conception of technological sovereignty for India—one that complements, rather than conflicts with, the country’s strengths as a hub of technical talent, ingenuity, and robust digital connectivity.\n\n(Meghna Balis the Director of the Esya Centre, a tech policy think tank.)\n\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "Bitcoin slipped to a two-month low early on January 30, which analysts attributed to broader \"risk-off\" mood in global markets, fall in metal prices and  on speculation that the next US Federal Reserve chairperson might tighten screws on cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe world’s largest crypto currency fell to $81,311 before recovering to trade around $83,085, a decline of about 5.85 percent in the past 24 hours. The decline triggered volatility across the crypto market, with over $1.7 billion in leveraged positions liquidated during the period.\n\n\"The decline followed a broader global risk-off move triggered by weak tech earnings and a sudden pullback in gold and silver after both hit record highs. Data shows the drop was driven mainly by futures deleveraging, not sustained spot selling,\" said Riya Sehgal, research analyst, Delta Exchange.\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk said in its daily brief that bitcoin is likely to consolidate in the near-term, as weaker leverage has been flushed, reducing immediate downside pressure. \"However, a decisive break below $82K could expose $79K–$80K, while sustained upside requires acceptance above $88,500, supported by improving spot demand and ETF flows,\" they said.\n\nEthereum was down 6.97 percent, Tehter 0.01 percent, XRP 6.20 percent, Solana 6.37 percent, Dogecoin 5.77  percent, Cardano 6.33, BNB 5.48 percent, USDC 0.02 percent, and Tron lost 0.86 percent in the past 24 hours.\n\n\"Amid the bearish wave, a few altcoins like LayerZero and Canton lead the top gainers by 7.45 percent and 6.78 percent jump, followed by DoubleZero and Morpho with minor gains. Besides, Worldcoin and Lighter plunged more than 14 percent each, followed by Chiliz with 13 percent and Hyperliquid and Mantle by over 11 percent each,\" said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\nHere's how the price of cryptocurrencies moved on January 30 as of 11:08 am IST.\n\n\"The crypto market saw a sharp pullback alongside equities and gold as rising US–Iran tensions and renewed concerns over a potential US government shutdown pushed investors into risk-off mode ,\" said Akshat Siddhant, lead quant analyst, Mudrex. Bitcoin presents an attractive opportunity for long-term investors, where gradual, disciplined accumulation can help achieve better risk-adjusted returns over time. Traders should closely watch the $80,600 support level, as a break below it could trigger further downward pressure.\n\nAccording to WazirX founder Nischal Shetty, bitcoin's drop was largely driven by the liquidation of excess leverage, with over $777 million in long positions liquidated in just one hour. This shows a broader reaction to macroeconomic developments, which have been triggering outsized moves in risk-on assets.",

        "full_content": "The shares of metals-to-oil conglomerateVedantadropped more than 8 percent on January 30 after the company released its results for the third quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. Brokerages have mixed views for the stock.\n\nThe shares of the company dropped to Rs 702.4 apiece in the morning trading hours of Friday to snap a six-session gaining streak. This comes a day after the stock hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 769.80 apiece.\n\nNotably, today’s sharp fall in Vedanta’s share price also comes amid a broader downturn in metal stocks, buoyed by profit booking, falling metal prices and speculation of a hawkish Federal Reserve Governor. The Nifty Metal index tumbled nearly 5 percent today.\n\nVedanta on January 29 reported a consolidatednet profit of Rs 5,710 crorefor the October-December quarter of FY26, marking a 61 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump from the Rs 3,547 crore net profit reported in the same period of the previous financial year.\n\nThe firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose 37 percent YoY to Rs 23,369 crore during the quarter under review. “Q3 FY26 has been a landmark quarter for Vedanta, delivering our highest-ever EBITDA of ₹15,171 crore, with two of our businesses achieving their best-ever financial results. Aluminium posted its strongest EBITDA margin of $1,268 per ton, supported by record alumina and aluminium production. Zinc India recorded its highest-ever quarterly EBITDA of ₹6,064 crore, driven by record mined and refined metal output, with silver contributing 44% of overall profit. Zinc International also reported a 28% YoY increase in production, led by Gamsberg achieving its highest-ever recovery,” said Arun Misra, Executive Director, Vedanta.\n\n“Our Oil & Gas business reached a major milestone with India’s first subsea template installation, while our Thermal Power Business delivered 188% YoY EBITDA growth with a 62% increase in sales volumes. Steel and Ferrochrome Business also achieved record production of steel billets at 285 kt, and ferrochrome output up 32% YoY,” he added.\n\nICICI Direct Research said that Vedanta’s overall performance for the quarter was aided by higher aluminium, zinc and silver prices, but any cool-off in non-ferrous metal prices and silver could potentially led to stock price decline.\n\nMotilal Oswal Financial Services kept a ‘Neutral’ rating on the shares of Vedanta, with a target price of Rs 810 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 6 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 766.35 apiece.\n\nThe domestic brokerage said that Vedanta’s Q3 operational performance came largely as expected, supported by better volumes and favorable LME prices. “Capex plans are progressing well and will likely lead to further cost savings. Management targets to maintain strong growth in earnings, led by the upcoming capacity, which will produce higher VAP products. VEDL remains firm on its deleveraging plans, and going forward, higher cash flows will support both its expansion plans and deleveraging efforts,” it added.\n\nThe stock currently trades at 7x EV/EBITDA and 4.4x P/BV on the FY27 estimate, Motilal said.\n\nEmkay Global kept a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, and increased its target price over 21 percent to Rs 850 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that the firm’s strong Q3 results were driven by higher aluminium and zinc profitability.\n\n“We continue to believe that if there was ever a better time in the past decade to own exposure to industrial metals, it is now,” it added.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "Copper sank from a record at the end of an extraordinarily volatile week, with trading marred by an glitch on the London Metal Exchange, as Chinese investors pulled back and the US dollar rose.\n\nBenchmark three-month futures dropped almost 4% to near $13,000 a ton on the LME, after peaking above $14,500 on Thursday. Still, copper remains on course for a solid weekly gain, the sixth in the past seven.\n\nWith global investors focused on metals after a series of major price swings in commodities, the LME — the trading venue that has set global prices for base metals for more than a century — suffered a one-hour delay to the start of trade due to technical issues.\n\nCopper has surged in the opening weeks of the new year, caught up in a wave of enthusiasm for base and precious metals that’s been especially evident in China, Asia’s largest economy and the leading consumer. The frenzy has been supercharged by optimism about demand given the energy transition, as well as a steady weakening in the US dollar, which hit a four-year low.\n\n“The market’s expectations have become too uniform at this stage and need some adjustment,” said Jerry Zhang, a trader at Ningbo Meishan Bonded Port Hongyi Investment Management Partnership Co. “Volatility has also become quite high, so we prefer to control risk and avoid participating too much.”\n\nThe US dollar rose on Friday — making commodities less attractive for many investors — amid speculation that the Trump administration is preparing for the president to nominate Kevin Warsh to be the next Federal Reserve chair.\n\nCopper traded 1.7% lower at $13,383 a ton on the LME at 12:36 p.m. in Singapore. The five other base-metal contracts — for aluminum, zinc, lead, nickel and tin — were all lower on the day.\n\nElsewhere, gold, silver, crude oil and iron ore also declined.\n\nThe rush into copper — as well as other base metals — lifted the catch-all LMEX Index to a record on Thursday, topping the peak that was set in 2022.\n\nCopper — a mainstay metal for wiring and batteries — has been in focus in recent quarters amid mine snarls, concerns about possible US import levies, and the outlook for demand given the global push for electrification.\n\nWhile prices remain on course for a weekly gain, some metrics suggest that near-term conditions are not tight. The spread between cash prices and three-month futures is more than $90 a ton in contango, a bearish pattern.\n\nAhead of Friday’s moves, Citigroup Inc. flagged copper may rally further in the near term, while also cautioning that resistance from physical users facing higher costs could be a drag over the full year.\n\nAlthough a jump for copper to $15,000 to $16,000 “does not look implausible,” the base case remained for a greater physical-market pushback, and that would mean copper averages $13,000 in 2026, the Citi analysts said.",

        "full_content": "New Fund Offers (NFOs) are back in the spotlight with thematic, factor-based and sector-specific funds dominating the list. While they present a wider choice, should you invest in an NFO just because it’s new?\n\n“The surge in NFOs, as of January 2026, indicates a clear shift in the Indian mutual fund landscape. Strategies of asset management companies are moving away from broad category fillers,” said Anup Bhaiya, founder, Money Honey Financial Services. Fund houses are trying to capture investor appetite through thematic, factor-based (Smart Beta), and sector-specific products, he said.\n\nAccording to the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), 23 new open-ended funds were launched in December, led by equity-oriented schemes, followed by hybrid schemes, raising Rs 4,074 crore. Overall, total inflows from NFOs for the calendar year 2025 stood at Rs 3.03 lakh crore.\n\nThe recent NFOs are mostly open-ended, allowing investors flexibility to buy or sell shares at the fund's current net asset value (NAV), without a cap on maturity or units. The latest NFOs seek to gather shareholders’ focus across thematic, factor-based (Smart Beta), and sector-specific funds.\n\nThematic funds offer exposure to infrastructure, defence, clean energy, digitalisation, and banking, to name a few. They are suited for investors who have a high risk appetite and can be explored on a limited basis with an allocation of 5-10 percent, say experts.\n\nThematic funds differ from sector-specific funds, as they invest across multiple sectors. Sectoral funds focus on a single industry. According to the latest AMFI data, there were 238 thematic (and sectoral) mutual funds with a total assets under management (AUM) of Rs 5.37 lakh crore as on December 31.\n\nAccording to Bhaiya, four of the 11 listed NFOs in January focus on financial services or consumption. “AMCs are betting heavily on the structural India story. They are carving out niches within sectors, like services versus banking. There has also been a significant rise in Index Funds and ETFs (Axis, Groww, Kotak), as investors increasingly look for lower-cost ways to participate in the market without manager risk.”\n\nFactor-based funds, or so-called smart beta funds, invest in a stocks using certain pre-set filters or rules to build portfolios. They take into account factors such as value, growth, quality and momentum while making investment decisions.\n\nExamples from the latest NFOs include funds like SBI Quality and Kotak Value. “It signifies that AMCs are moving beyond simple stock picking. They are now offering a rules-based strategy that targets specific traits like quality, low volatility, or value,” Bhaiya said.\n\nFinancial advisers suggest investors avoid short-term trends and align their investment with their financial goals, time horizon and risk appetite. Look for funds that are data-driven, evidence-based and offer controlled risk management when choosing NFOs, they say.",

        "full_content": "The London Metal Exchange suffered a one-hour delay to the start of trading on Friday after a technical problem, causing confusion among traders after a week of intense volatility and eye-watering price gains.\n\nElectronic trading on the world’s biggest metals bourse — which sets global prices for vital commodities from copper to zinc and aluminum — got underway belatedly at 10:00 a.m. Hong Kong time.\n\nThe delay came at a moment when nerves have been fraying in metals markets as participants cope with sudden and extreme moves. On Thursday, LME copper jumped 11%, its biggest intraday gain since 2008, to hit a record above $14,500 a ton.\n\nSeveral traders said there was already speculation on Friday over who might be sitting on losses when many received a notice from the LME announcing the hold-up. A prolonged outage could have complicated issues for those wanting to exit positions.\n\nCalls to the LME officials in London were not answered outside working hours. A spokesman for Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., which owns the LME, did not have an immediate comment on the incident.\n\nTrading pauses or delays are not entirely unheard of across global exchanges. A major data center malfunction took down markets operated by CME Group Inc. for more than 10 hours in December, halting trading across equities, foreign exchange, bonds and commodities.\n\nBut reliability has been a major focus for the LME since 2022, when a crisis in the nickel market triggered by a massive short squeeze led to some trades being declared void. That episode prompted an overhaul of regulations.\n\nGlobal metals markets have enjoyed a dramatic start to 2026, fueled by an intense wave of speculative trading, especially in China. The Shanghai Futures Exchange is having its busiest ever month in volume terms for six base metals, and frenzied trading there has driven LME prices higher.\n\nAfter the LME opened on Friday, copper fell as much 3.9%, with other metals also dropping. That followed declines during the previous hour on the SHFE.",

Additionally, metal prices significantly declined today. Gold and silver futures dropped around 6 percent each on the MCX, while Copper and aluminium futures with February expiries fell up to 4 percent in the morning trading hours.\n\nThe sharp fall in global metal prices comes amid speculations that the US Federal Reserve may get a more hawkish chair. US President Donald Trump said he intends to announce his pick to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday, as speculation intensifies over who will lead the American central bank after Jerome Powell steps aside in May.\n\n\"So, a potentially less dovish Fed Chairman pick, a rebound in the dollar and gold giving way to overbought conditions have contributed to the decline in the price of the precious metal,\" Reuters quoted KCM Chief Trade Analyst Tim Waterer as saying.\n\nHindustan Coppershares dropped 10.5 percent to trade at Rs 680 apiece. This comes a day after the stock jumped 20 percent to hit a fresh lifetime high of Rs 760.05 apiece. National Aluminium Company (NALCO) shares fell around 10 percent.\n\nVedantashares dropped 8 percent, a day after the company released its results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026.

It regained some of the losses to trade at $5,209, still down 2.06 percent decline from its previous close.\n\n\"Gold price dropped by more than 5 percent marking the steepest intraday decline since October 2025, as the broader precious metals complex cooled. Interestingly, domestic prices fell more than international prices yesterday, raising price parity concerns. While the USDINR market reached a record high, the Dollar index also reversed once again from recent lows of 96,\" said Manav Modi, Commodities Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.\n\nGold prices vary by purity. Check the prices of gold based on its purity:\n\nCity-wise gold prices in India today\n\nGold rates across India’s major cities showed remarkable uniformity, with only marginal differences due to local taxes, jeweller margins, and logistics costs.\n\nAccording to Modi, the sharp rally has already pushed some physical buyers to the sidelines, with the World Gold Council noting that central bank purchases moderated in Q4 2025, although strong investor inflows more than offset the slowdown.\n\n\"The council also warned that India’s gold imports are likely to decline this year as record prices weigh on jewellery demand in the world’s second-largest consumer. Despite the pullback, gold remains on track for its strongest monthly performance since the 1980s, underpinned by persistent economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Tensions remain elevated after US President Trump urged Iran to negotiate a nuclear deal, prompting threats of retaliation from Tehran,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve held rates steady, with markets still expecting a first rate cut in June as investors await the announcement of a new Fed chair to succeed Jerome Powell in May. On the data front, US consumer confidence and weekly jobless claims supported bullions rally. Factory order data was reported better than expectations. Focus today will be on the US PPI data, he said.\n\nThe Augmont Bullion report, published on January 29, said that gold’s surge beyond $5,600 (₹1,80,000) reflects a deepening macro and geopolitical risk premium rather than short-term speculation. Sustaining above $5600 (Rs 1,87,000) opens the door to $5800–$6000 (Rs 1,87,000–1,95,000). Strong support at $5200 (Rs 1,60,000), a break could trigger profit-booking toward $5,000–$4,750.\n\nGold prices typically fall when the dollar strengthens. When the dollar gains value, it becomes more expensive for individuals and institutions using other currencies to purchase the same amount of gold, which tends to reduce demand and thus the price.",

        "full_content": "Gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) declined in trade on January 30, as the prices of the precious metals plunged after a record rally.\n\nGold futures with April expiry on MCX dropped around 5 percent to trade at Rs 1,75,100 per 10 grams. This comes a day after the contracts hit a fresh lifetime high of Rs 1,93,096 per 10 grams. The contracts with February and June expiries fell around 6 percent each in the early trading hours of Friday.\n\nSilver futures with March expiry meanwhile dropped around 6 percent to Rs 3,75,900 per kilogram. The contracts with May and July expiries also fell around 6 percent each.\n\nNippon India ETF Gold BeES, which has delivered a return of 104 percent over the past one year, dropped around 10 percent to trade at Rs 132 apiece.ICICI Prudential Gold ETFalso plunged nearly 10 percent, while Axis Gold ETF fell around 9 percent.\n\nUTI Gold ETF, Edelweiss Gold, ETF,HDFC Gold ETF, Quantum Gold ETF, DSP Gold ETF and others also significantly dropped in trade.\n\nAmong the silver ETFs, Mirae Asset Silver ETF fell around 13 percent, while Motilal Oswal Silver ETF dropped around 12.5 percent to Rs 330.01 apiece. HDFC Silver ETF andNippon India Silver ETFmeanwhile plunged more than 14 percent each.\n\nAditya Birla Sun Life Silver ETF,Groww Silver ETF, ICICI Prudential Silver ETF, Axis Silver ETF, UTI Silver ETF, Tata Silver ETF, Kotak Silver ETF also declined sharply.\n\nWhy are gold and silver prices crashing today?\n\nThe sharp fall in global prices of the precious metals comes amid speculations that the US Federal Reserve may get a more hawkish chair. Spot gold fell 5 percent on Friday, a day after hitting a record high of $5,594.82.\n\nUS President Donald Trump said he intends to announce his pick to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday, as speculation intensifies over who will lead the American central bank after Jerome Powell steps aside in May.\n\n\"So, a potentially less dovish Fed Chairman pick, a rebound in the dollar and gold giving way to overbought conditions have contributed to the decline in the price of the precious metal,\" Reuters quoted KCM Chief Trade Analyst Tim Waterer as saying.\n\n\"Rumours that Kevin Warsh will replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair has weighed on gold during Asian trade,\" said Matt Simpson, a senior analyst at StoneX, as quoted by the report.\n\nThe market is divided between those viewing corrections as buying opportunities and those warning of overheated conditions, said Tanvi Kanchan, Associate Director at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers. She however added that despite price swings, fundamentals are compelling, driven by near-record industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles, and AI infrastructure.\n\nKanchan however cautioned that after such explosive gains in 2025, timing a single entry point is “treacherous”. “Rather than deploying capital all at once, investors should consider spreading purchases over the coming weeks or months. This approach captures the dip while protecting against further corrections that could see silver test,” she said.\n\nFor conservative investors, allocating 5-10 percent of portfolios to precious metals ETFs through systematic purchases reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to an asset class that benefits from geopolitical instability and monetary policy uncertainty, according to the expert.\n\nWith structural drivers such as central-bank accumulation, long-term demand and inflation hedging undiminished, disciplined investors may see this correction as a strategic accumulation zone, but should avoid aggressive short-term speculation given ongoing volatility, Khoo from VT Market said.\n\nNirpendra Yadav, Senior Commodity Research Analyst at Bonanza, said that with global uncertainties, central bank gold accumulation, and expectations of softer real interest rates over the medium term, gold continues to play an important portfolio-hedging and diversification role.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "India enters 2026 on a relatively firm economic footing. Growth has held up in a difficult global environment. Public investment has expanded capacity. Corporate balance sheets are healthier than they were a few years ago. And, for the most part, policy has become more predictable.\n\nYet speak to business leaders across sectors, and a quieter concern surfaces. Compliance has become easier. Approvals are more transparent. But operating costs remain stubbornly high. The friction has shifted, not disappeared.\n\nThis is the more interesting business story buried in the Economic Survey 2025–26, which repeatedly points to a less visible constraint: system-level input costs. Not just the cost of capital, but energy, freight, logistics pricing, upstream materials, and the way climate transition costs are layered onto firms. Together, these costs are beginning to shape competitiveness more than regulation or taxation.\n\nIn simple terms, India has reduced many of the visible barriers to doing business. The harder work now lies in fixing the invisible ones.\n\nInfrastructure pricing hasn’t caught up\n\nLogistics is often cited as a success story and rightly so. Highways, freight corridors, ports, and digital coordination platforms have expanded rapidly. The Survey acknowledges these gains and notes improvements in logistics efficiency over recent years.\n\nBut it also flags something businesses encounter every day: pricing still distorts behaviour. Rail freight, for instance, continues to be cross-subsidised in ways that raise tariffs for industrial users. Predictably, cargo shifts back to roads, eroding efficiency gains and pushing up costs across the system.\n\nThe contrast with global peers is telling. Rail accounts for roughly a quarter to a third of freight movement in India, compared to 40–50 per cent in many large manufacturing economies. This is not simply about building more tracks. It is about how incentives are structured and prices are set. For firms operating on thin margins, reliability and predictability matter as much as physical capacity.\n\nThe Survey is unusually candid on electricity pricing. It explains how cross-subsidisation in power distribution loads higher tariffs onto industrial and commercial users to offset lower tariffs elsewhere. In many states, industrial tariffs remain materially above the average supply cost.\n\nThat matters because electricity is not a niche input. It underpins manufacturing, cold chains, healthcare facilities, data centres, and an increasingly digital services economy. Availability has improved. Outages are fewer. But pricing still penalises precisely those users who need scale and efficiency to compete globally.\n\nReforms to move toward more cost-reflective tariffs are underway, and that direction is important. Until then, power will continue to be a quiet but persistent drag on competitiveness.\n\nClimate transition can raise costs\n\nMuch of the public discussion around the climate transition assumes competitiveness will follow automatically. The Economic Survey itself is careful not to make that assumption. While it does not directly link net-zero pathways to input-cost distortions, it does underscore the importance of sequencing, system readiness, and cost discipline in sustaining growth.\n\nThe risk, therefore, lies not in ambition but in design. If climate mandates are rolled out faster than grids are strengthened, transition finance deepened, and pricing structures rationalised, they could add to existing cost pressures before productivity gains materialise. For export-oriented firms, that timing mismatch matters.\n\nCapital cost reflects more than interest rates\n\nOne of the Survey’s more under-appreciated arguments concerns capital costs. It suggests that India’s relatively high cost of capital cannot be explained by monetary policy or financial depth alone. Instead, it links capital costs to structural factors, notably India’s reliance on foreign savings because of a persistent current account deficit.\n\nEconomies that depend on external capital carry a risk premium, and that premium is reflected in borrowing costs. This helps explain why long-term capital in India continues to trade at a premium to some peers with similar credit ratings, despite strong growth prospects.\n\nFor businesses, the implication is straightforward. Cheaper capital is not just a banking-sector issue. It is also about export depth and external resilience. Corporate strategies that remain import-heavy or inward-looking may make sense individually, but collectively they reinforce the macro conditions that keep capital expensive for everyone.\n\nWhen protection quietly becomes fragility\n\nThe Survey is refreshingly direct on industrial policy trade-offs. It warns that protection in upstream sectors such as steel, aluminium, and textile fibres often amounts to a tax on downstream manufacturers, particularly exporters. Decisions about what not to protect, it argues, can be just as important as decisions about what to support.\n\nIn a fragmented global economy, protection can feel reassuring. Over time, however, it raises input costs, discourages scale, and weakens competitiveness. Firms disciplined by global prices may ultimately be more resilient than those shielded from them.\n\nThe Survey goes a step further, noting that where upstream sectors are capital-intensive, lowering the cost of capital is a more efficient form of support than raising import barriers, precisely because it preserves downstream competitiveness.\n\nNext reform frontier is cost discipline\n\nNone of this diminishes India’s growth story. The Survey itself is optimistic about medium-term prospects. But it does suggest that the next phase of reform will be less visible and more difficult. It will focus on pricing structures, sequencing, and system-wide efficiency rather than on headline announcements.\n\nFor policymakers, that means aligning energy pricing, logistics tariffs, climate transition finance, and trade policy with competitiveness outcomes. For business leaders, it means recognising that firm-level optimisation is no longer enough.Cost structure is now a strategy.\n\nIndia has done the hard work of removing many obvious barriers to growth. The challenge ahead lies in fixing the quieter ones, the costs embedded in systems that compound across sectors. If those are addressed with the same seriousness as past reforms, India’s growth story will not just endure; it will thrive.\n\n(Suryaprabha Sadasivan, Senior Vice President, Chase Advisors.)\n\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "The Metropolitan Stock Exchange (MSE) is making a comeback. Powered by an upgraded engine and backed by more than Rs 1,200-crore from fintech investors, MSE aims to challenge the duopoly of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and BSE.\n\nAfter a long break, MSE resumed trading on January 27. Building on this momentum, MSE will hold a special trading session on February 1, to coincide with the presentation of the Union Budget 2026.\n\n“A relaunch typically reflects upgraded systems, improved governance, increased transparency, and renewed efforts to rebuild trust and relevance in the market. The process involves fixing previous system flaws to meet present market requirements instead of creating an entirely new system,” said Piyush Jhunjhunwala, CEO & Founder, Stockify.\n\nFounded in 2008, the MSE launched its currency derivatives segment on October 7 that year. Originally called MCX-SX, it was rebranded in 2015 and subsequently gained recognition from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to operate in multiple segments, including currency derivatives, debt securities, equities, and equity derivatives.\n\nA lot has changed since MSE’s earlier avatar. Digital infrastructure has improved dramatically and regulatory framework is far stronger, which, along with a growing economy, have seen a huge growth in investor base.\n\nWere investors aware of it earlier?\n\nInvestor awareness was poor as financial literacy stayed low and marketing efforts failed. Retail investors, who depended on traditional brokerage services and major stock exchanges, paid little attention to other trading platforms.\n\nIn the past, information was distributed through slow methods that relied mostly on physical channels. Investors now use social media platforms and financial applications together with online news websites and digital marketing campaigns to discover investment opportunities, Jhunjhunwala said. Both regulators and institutions work together to support programmes that educate investors. Public awareness has increased through the efforts of organisations that set up platforms that citizens can access, he said.\n\nWith fewer listed companies and products, investors may find it difficult to build a diversified portfolio on MSE compared with what is available on NSE or BSE.\n\nOne major concern is liquidity. The MSE trading platform experiences lower trading activity because its market participants buy and sell securities less frequently than they do on bigger platforms. The situation creates challenges for investors who want to buy or sell assets because they must deal with price changes, which can result in financial losses without warning.\n\nAnkur Punj, MD and Business Head, Equirus Wealth, said, “With a limited universe of listed companies, diversification options are narrower, and trading volumes tend to be thinner, which can increase volatility and make exits challenging during stressed market conditions.”\n\nJhunjhunwala said the current issue involves two main aspects. The existence of stock trading on smaller exchanges needs to be understood because it results in reduced research coverage from analysts, institutional investors, and financial media outlets for those stocks that trade on every actively traded market.\n\n“Retail investors have limited access to reliable information, making it difficult to assess a company's true value and economic position. The information gap leads to decisions that rely more on guesswork instead of trustworthy fundamental data,” he said.\n\nCompanies that operate on these platforms sometimes are in earlier development stages because they fail to fulfil the strict requirements needed for listing on larger exchanges. The situation creates new possibilities but increases the likelihood of governance problems and inconsistent business disclosures, thereby, raising operational threats to the organisation.\n\n“The major exchanges provide better security for investors because they establish stricter rules and offer more financial resources and superior investor safeguards. The MSE platform supports specific trading strategies and short-term market movements, yet it does not function as an effective platform for building long-term financial assets,\" Jhunjhunwala said.\n\nAccording to the experts, MSE can still be relevant for sophisticated investors who understand liquidity risk and are willing to take selective, long-term exposure to specific companies.\n\n“The present day shows a distinct change compared to the previous period. The previous period had limited participation because there were only a few registered companies and the market had low trading activity and weak trading capacity. Businesses showed a preference for established markets because these platforms provided better visibility and increased investor trust,” said Jhunjhunwala.\n\nMore companies, especially SMEs and startups, are entering the capital market. Digital onboarding, faster compliance processes and simplified listing procedures have resulted in increased participation. “Investors now possess improved access to data and analytics and real-time information, which leads to better decision-making. The market has progressed toward greater inclusivity, transparency, and competitive business practices,\" experts said.\n\nShould retail investors dive into the MSE trade\n\nRetail investors looking to build long-term wealth are being urged by experts to think carefully before placing bets on the Metropolitan Stock Exchange, as concerns about its scale, liquidity, and ability to compete with the NSE and the BSE remain.\n\nKranthi Bathini, Equity Strategist at WealthMills Securities Pvt Ltd, said, “In the equity space, we already have very strong and well-established players, with NSE as the clear market leader and BSE in second place. At this stage, the scope for a third exchange is very limited.”\n\nBathini said the MSE is not new,  it was earlier known as MCX-SX and has only changed its name. Winning back investor confidence will take time and it will be crucial.\n\nThere is some speculation in the unlisted space because of valuations but NSE has a very strong presence and steady cash flows. “For MSE, increasing its market presence and trading volumes will be crucial. This is a high-risk option and is suitable only for investors with a high-risk appetite,” said Bathini.\n\nFor those focused on steady wealth creation, established exchanges continue to offer deeper markets, better liquidity and stronger investor protection. Until MSE proves it can attract large volumes and listings, caution is likely to remain the wiser course.\n\n“For most retail investors, however, larger exchanges offer a more stable and transparent ecosystem that is better suited to systematic wealth creation,” Punj said.",

You can email your queries to askwalletwise@nw18.com, and we will try to get a top financial expert to address.\n\nCan I continue using Form ITR-1 if I stay outside India for more than 182 days and attain NRI status during that financial year? I have a \"Long Term Visitor Pass\" visa for Singapore, which does not allow me to earn income during my stay. Also, suggest should I check the \"resident\" or the \"non-resident\" option while filing ITR-1 Form.\n\nExpert’s Advice:The ITR form, along with the relevant rules, is notified every year by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) after the end of the financial year. So, for the current fiscal, the rules prescribing the criteria and the relevant ITR form will be available only after the CBDT notifies them after March 31, 2026.\n\nThe ITR-1 form is used by the majority of taxpayers. However, one of the restrictions is regarding the residential status of the individual for the financial year for which the ITR is to be filed. The Income Tax laws do not permit a non-resident individual to use the ITR 1 form. The use of an ITR form is not dependent on the visa status but on the physical stay of the person in India. It is also not dependent on whether you’re earning any income during your stay outside India.\n\nUnder the Income Tax law, a person is treated as a non-resident if they have been in India for less than 182 days. Since you will be outside India for more than 182 days, you become ineligible to use ITR Form 1. The question of resident or non-resident does not arise here. While using other applicable ITR forms, you will have to select your status as non-resident and the reason being physically outside India for more than 182 days.",

        "full_content": "Asian investors are pouring record amounts into gold exchange-traded funds, leading some to question whether the rally in bullion is getting close to topping out.\n\nPrecious metals ETFs listed in the region have attracted $7.1 billion in net inflows in January, with a number drawing in all-time amounts of capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest gains were seen by funds listed in China that cater to retail investors, with Huaan Yifu Gold ETF alone luring in $1.9 billion.\n\nThe price of bullion has skyrocketed is recent weeks, with the yellow metal advancing more than 20% since the start of January, despite a pullback on Friday. High levels of buying by retail investors is often seen as a sign a rally is in its later stages and an asset is overvalued.\n\n“We have been major gold bulls in this cycle,” buying both gold-mining stocks and ETFs, said Nick Ferres, chief investment officer at Vantage Point Asset Management in Singapore. “However, the recent price action has become rapid, emotional and non-linear, which is a warning sign that the trend is extended tactically.”\n\nGold’s breakneck rally has been underpinned by elevated central-bank purchases and inflows into bullion-backed ETFs. Total holdings in gold-backed funds rose every month last year except May, according to World Gold Council data. Precious metals have also benefited from a switch away from the dollar due to unpredictable US policymaking and increasing American isolation.\n\nAmid other warnings signs, gold’s relative strength index has climbed to about 90, above the level of 70 that is taken to indicate a pullback is overdue. A successful outcome from policies set by the Trump administration would accelerate economic growth, leading to higher interest rates and a stronger US dollar, pushing gold lower, the World Gold Council said in its 2026 outlook published last month.\n\nAmong other China-listed funds that have seen sizable inflows in January, the ChinaAMC Gold ETF drew in $420 million, while the GF Shanghai Gold ETF attracted $191.4 million, both set for records, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nSome silver-focused Asian ETFs are also heading for monthly inflow records. South Korea-listed Samsung KODEX Silver Futures Special Asset ETF has gained $231.6 million in net inflows for January, also set for a record.\n\nIn another sign of frenzied demand, China’s only pure-play silver fund — the UBS SDIC Silver Futures Fund LOF — paused subscriptions on Wednesday and halted trading Friday, after massive inflows drove the fund to an elevated premium over its underlying assets.\n\nAsset management companies are set to respond to the rising demand for gold ETFs by bringing new products to the market, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n“ETF issuers are likely to tap demand for safe-haven assets with more gold-related funds,” analysts Rebecca Sin and Michelle Leung wrote in a research note. “Hong Kong, which offers tools ranging from low-cost physical tracking to leveraged futures and mining equities, has two new listings this week as it seeks to strengthen its position as a gold trading hub.”",

These forums focus on strengthening cooperation and addressing barriers affecting cross-border space trade and joint missions.\n\nA questionnaire has been circulated to the industry which seeks detailed responses on regulatory and licensing obstacles encountered by Indian firms selling space hardware, software and services to US customers.\n\nThese include issues related to export licences, payload approvals, data restrictions and certification requirements.\n\nA key area of focus is the impact of US export control regimes such as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and rules governing the use of US-origin components.\n\nIN-SPACe has asked companies to highlight what specific relaxations or clarifications could improve the process of making deals with American partners.\n\nAccording to sources, IN-SPACe has also asked which US approval processes, including launch permissions, satellite licensing, and so on could be reformed to encourage stronger India–US partnerships.\n\nStartups have also been asked to suggest mechanisms that could help Indian firms be recognised as \"trusted suppliers\" for sensitive US space supply chains. These include certifications, secure facilities, compliance frameworks and audit systems.\n\nCompanies have also been asked whether India's current intellectual property, data-sharing and co-development rules are flexible to support research and development with US firms.\n\nThis outreach by IN-SPACe marks a shift by New Delhi to translate diplomatic goodwill into market access for Indian firms. By gathering empirical data on US regulatory bottlenecks, India is arming itself with the evidence needed to challenge legacy export controls and licensing barriers at upcoming trade talks.",

The S&P 500 closed well above its session low but still ended the day down 9.02 points, or 0.13%, at 6,969.01.\n\nYields on the 10-year Treasury up 3 basis points at 4.26 percent, while the yields on 2-year US Treasuries were up marginally at 3.56 percent.\n\nPresident Trump’s comments that he plans to announce his nomination for the next Fed chair have helped to support the US dollar as it climbs ~0.4% against the yen, euro and other major peers.\n\nAsian currencies were trading lower in the early trade on Friday with Thai Baht leading the losers followed by Japanese Yen, Malaysian Ringgit, Singapore Dollar.\n\nOil prices are headed for their biggest monthly gains in years on Friday as tensions in the Middle East escalated over a possible U.S. attack on Iran that could disrupt supplies from one of the biggest OPEC producers.\n\nGold prices fell on Friday, pressured by a firmer dollar, but were set for their biggest monthly gain since 1980 as investors piled into the safe-haven metal amid persistent geopolitical and economic uncertainties.\n\nOn January 29, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold shares worth Rs 393 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) purchased equities of Rs 2638 crore in the market.\n\nHope you're all set for today's trade. We wish you a profitable day ahead.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "The benchmark indices added 0.3 percent gains and maintained an uptrend for three consecutive sessions on January 29, but market breadth turned negative. About 1,717 shares declined against 1,205 advancing shares on the NSE. The market may see range-bound trading ahead of the Union Budget scheduled on February 1. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:\n\nJay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services\n\nNTPC consolidated in a long-term wedge since April 2025. After breaking above the wedge, it traded sideways in a rectangular range. The latest session delivered a strong breakout above this range on robust positive volume, confirming buyer conviction.\n\nThe price now trades above all key EMAs with upward slopes. The RSI holds support at 50 on both daily and weekly charts, supporting continued bullish momentum. The structure remains firmly bullish while support holds.\n\nIpca Laboratories| CMP: Rs 1,479.7\n\nIpca Laboratories broke out from a prolonged triangular consolidation (from January 2–9, 2026), gaining 13.6 percent while broader indices fell around 2.5 percent, showing clear relative strength. The breakout was backed by strong volume. The stock is now retesting the breakout zone and formed a dragonfly doji on January 21, signalling throwback exhaustion. Support has been defended for the third time.\n\nMomentum indicators remain bullish and rising. The price is trading above short-, medium-, and long-term EMAs. Repeated support defence and relative strength point to a high-probability reversal. Adding more above Rs 1,525 could propel the bullish move.\n\nNMDC broke out above a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on December 23 from Rs 78.6, rallying to Rs 86.72 before correcting. The pullback found support at the 100-day EMA and successfully retested the breakout zone.\n\nThe latest bounce formed a strong three white soldiers pattern with rising positive volume, confirming accumulation. The price trades above all key EMAs with upward slopes. Momentum indicators align bullishly, and the structure favours buyers as long as the 100-day EMA holds.\n\nOm Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities\n\nMishra Dhatu Nigam| CMP: Rs 387.5\n\nMishra Dhatu Nigam has shown a sharp pickup in momentum and is now attempting to break above a long-standing downward trendline on the daily chart. The stock has moved decisively higher and is trading above its short-term moving average, indicating improving strength. Volumes have remained stable alongside the rise in price.\n\nThe daily RSI is placed near 66, highlighting strengthening momentum. The DMI setup shows the positive directional line above the negative line, while the ADX remains elevated, confirming improving trend strength. As long as the stock sustains above the Rs 360 zone, the near-term outlook remains positive.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation| CMP: Rs 366.95\n\nBPCL has bounced back from a triple bottom pattern after a corrective phase. The stock is now holding above the previous resistance zone and is attempting to move higher from the Rs 360–365 area. It is trading above its short- and medium-term moving averages and has reclaimed the mid-Bollinger band.\n\nThe daily RSI is placed near the 55 level. The rate of change indicator remains in positive territory, supporting the ongoing recovery attempt. As long as BPCL holds above the Rs 355 support area, the near-term outlook remains steady. The stock is also respecting the rising VWAP (volume-weighted average price).\n\nBSE has maintained its post-September recovery and is currently trading within a well-defined range on the daily chart. After a sharp advance from the September lows, the stock has spent the last several weeks consolidating between the Rs 2,650 and Rs 2,950 zones, with prices now positioned in the upper half of this range.\n\nThe stock continues to trade above its 20-day average near Rs 2,750, indicating that short-term support remains intact. The daily RSI is placed near 60, reflecting steady momentum. The DMI setup shows the positive directional line above the negative line, while the ADX remains low. As long as the stock holds above Rs 2,750, the broader setup remains stable, with a directional move likely only on a decisive range breakout.\n\nHitesh Tailor, Technical Research Analyst at Choice Broking\n\nLarsen & Toubro| CMP: Rs 3,932.9\n\nLarsen & Toubro continues to exhibit a strong bullish structure in the longer-term trend. On the weekly chart, the stock is maintaining a clear higher high–higher low formation, confirming sustained trend strength. Recently, L&T delivered a breakout above its previous higher high. Post-breakout, the price retraced toward the 50-week EMA, where it found strong support and resumed its upward move, indicating healthy pullback buying and trend validation.\n\nThe stock is trading comfortably above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-week EMAs, reinforcing the presence of a robust primary uptrend and positive medium-to-long-term sentiment. On the downside, Rs 3,800 acts as an important support zone, where accumulation activity is visible. The latest weekly candle has engulfed the previous range, reflecting renewed bullish dominance and improving momentum.\n\nIndus Towers has recently delivered a decisive breakout from its prolonged sideways range, signalling the beginning of a fresh bullish phase. Post-breakout, the stock witnessed a healthy retest of the breakout zone, where it successfully took support aligned with the 50-day EMA and has since started moving higher, indicating strong follow-through buying and improving price structure.\n\nThe stock is trading above its key 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMAs, confirming a well-established uptrend and reinforcing positive short-to-medium-term sentiment. From the recent bottom, Indus Towers is forming a higher high and higher low structure, reflecting sustained demand and trend continuation. On the downside, Rs 425 remains an important support area, where accumulation activity is clearly visible.\n\nMomentum also supports the bullish view, with the RSI placed at 61.89, holding above the midline and turning higher, suggesting strengthening upside momentum.\n\nAxis Bank is showing clear signs of strength after registering a decisive breakout above its previous higher high. The breakout is supported by strong volumes, indicating genuine buying interest and improved participation, which enhances the reliability of the move and signals bullish intent.\n\nOn the weekly chart, the stock is trading comfortably above its key 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-week EMAs, confirming a well-established primary uptrend and strengthening medium-to-long-term sentiment. On the downside, the Rs 1,320–1,340 zone emerges as an important support area, aligned with the earlier higher-high breakout region, indicating a classic role reversal from resistance to support and providing a favourable risk-reward setup.\n\nMomentum indicators further support the bullish outlook, with the RSI placed at 69.36, reflecting a strong rising trend and sustained upside momentum without immediate signs of exhaustion.",

        "full_content": "India’s new consumer price index (CPI) series, set to be released on February 12, will mark a significant shift in how inflation is measured, with food losing prominence and rural India gaining a larger say in the overall index.\n\nAccording to the report of the expert group on revising the CPI base year, the weight of food and beverages in the headline index will decline sharply to 36.8 percent from 45.9 percent in the current 2012-based series. The change reflects evolving consumption patterns, with households spending a greater share on non-food items and services as incomes rise and urbanisation deepens.\n\nWhile food’s influence on headline inflation will reduce, the new series places a higher weight on rural India. The rural share in CPI is expected to rise to 55.4 percent, compared with 53.52 percent earlier. In contrast, the weight of urban India will fall to 44.6 percent from 46.48 percent. This rebalancing is based on updated consumption expenditure data and signals the continued importance of rural demand in shaping national inflation trends.\n\nA closer look at the expenditure groups shows that several non-food categories have gained weight in the new 2024 series. Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels now account for 17.7 percent of the index, up from 16.9 percent earlier. Health services have also seen a marginal increase to 6.1 percent from 5.9 percent, while transport and communication have edged up to 12.4 percent from 8.6 percent earlier.\n\nRestaurants and accommodation services account for 3.3 percent. Personal care, social protection and miscellaneous goods and services have been assigned a 5 percent share, reflecting the growing role of services in household spending.\n\nSome traditional categories, however, have lost ground. Clothing and footwear now account for 6.4 percent of the basket, slightly lower than 6.5 percent earlier, while education services have seen a sharper drop to 3.3 percent from 4.5 percent. Recreation, sport and culture also now carry a weight of 1.5 percent.\n\nOverall, the “miscellaneous” group—which largely captures non-food items and services—has expanded significantly, rising to 36.2 percent from 28.3 percent earlier. This structural shift is expected to make headline inflation less volatile over time, as the index becomes less sensitive to sharp swings in food prices, particularly vegetables.\n\nFor policymakers, the changes imply that future CPI readings may better reflect underlying demand conditions, even as rural price trends continue to play a dominant role in shaping India’s inflation trajectory.\n\nThe Economic Survey released on January 29 noted that inflation is likely to stay benign in the coming year, but core inflation still needed to be monitored.",

        "full_content": "Oracle Corp. shares have fallen more than 50% from last year’s all-time high as investors concerned about the artificial intelligence trade and the company’s links to OpenAI flee the stock.\n\nThe stock’s decline has erased about $463 billion in market value from a record hit on Sept. 10 after the company reported an impressive outlook for its cloud business that pointed to soaring demand for AI. The rally brought Oracle’s valuation to more than $933 billion, making it the 10th most valuable publicly-listed US company at the time.\n\nThe swift decline in Oracle shares has been amplified by growing investor concern over AI as the biggest technology companies continue to pledge billions of dollars in capital expenditures to build out data centers, in some cases without a clear return on investment. Added to the mix are circular deals between OpenAI, a private company that’s not profitable, and companies such as Oracle and Nvidia. Oracle has also raised tens of billions of dollars of bonds recently through note sales in its name and indirectly through projects it’s backing.\n\n“There’s some assumptions built in here about what OpenAI is going to spend and where are they getting that money and, you know, is this really going to happen,” said Eric Diton, president and managing director of Wealth Alliance, an investment advisory firm. “Maybe Oracle stock got way ahead of fundamentals and now the market’s saying, alright, show me, I wanna see it.”\n\nOracle’s December earnings report kicked off the most recent leg lower, as the company said it ramped up spending on AI data centers, feeding concerns about how long it will take for the expenditures to pay off. A measure of Oracle’s credit risk jumped to its highest level since 2009 following the report.\n\nShares have also been weighed down by news that Blue Owl Capital, which has helped finance data center projects for Oracle and Meta Platforms Inc, is not included in final negotiations on an equity deal for a data center project in Michigan. Oracle said the negotiations are “on schedule.”\n\nIt’s also been caught up in a broader selloff in software stocks, which have seen valuations compressed as investor concern about disruption from AI mount.

        "full_content": "Copper surged by the most in more than 16 years, after a wave of buying from Chinese investors triggered one of the most dramatic moves in the market’s history.\n\nPrices gained as much as 11% to trade above $14,500 a ton for the first time ever, before a sharp retracement on Thursday afternoon as the dollar jumped.\n\nThe industrial metal, which is used in almost every electrical application, has risen about 21% since the start of December, firing up copper bulls who have long been predicting a surge in prices.\n\n“You wait a lifetime for markets like this,” said Mark Thompson, a mining executive and former trader at Trafigura Group with three decades of experience in the copper market. “We are one supply disruption away from $20,000.”\n\nChinese investors are piling into metals as they ride a powerful wave of momentum that has lifted everything from tin to silver to record highs. The initial surge in copper took place at a time of day when Chinese traders dominate flows, with prices on the London Metal Exchange rising more than 5% in less than an hour starting at 2.30 a.m. London time.\n\n“This is all driven by speculative funds,” said Yan Weijun, head of nonferrous metals research at Chinese trader Xiamen C&D Inc. “It’s likely all Chinese money given the surge is in Asian hours.”\n\nPrices rose more than $1,400 a ton before sliding by as much as $1,000 in less than an hour as US markets opened with a broad risk-off mood.\n\nCopper has long been a favorite of investors who see the energy transition and the growth of data centers driving demand. Still, the recent surge in prices has come in spite of indications of weak demand in China itself, which accounts for about half of physical consumption of the metal, and a widening contango on the LME, an indication of ample supplies.\n\nThe speculative frenzy has driven a surge in volumes on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, China’s top commodities trading platform. January was already the busiest month on record for the SHFE’s six base metals as of last week, and copper racked up its second-biggest daily trading volumes ever on Thursday.\n\nIt’s been an eye-watering few weeks for commodities, which have been aided by a sinking US dollar, rising demand for real, physical assets, and elevated geopolitical tensions as the Trump administration follows a more assertive foreign policy. Most recently, speculation that the next Federal Reserve chief will be more dovish than Jerome Powell has aided the rally.\n\n“Commodities are taking turns to rally,” said Eric Liu, deputy general manager of ASK Resources Co. “Copper has been hovering around $13,000 and funds have been brewing over the metal for some time.”\n\nCopper was up 3.1% at $13,495.00 a ton on the LME. Its intraday move was the biggest since 2009 — when China was rolling out massive stimulus measures in the aftermath of the great financial crisis. SHFE futures reached 114,000 yuan ($16,400) a ton as the exchange reopened for evening trading, following a 5.8% increase to 109,110 yuan at the close on Thursday. Other metals also rallied sharply in the morning before retreating in the afternoon, with aluminum down 1.5% and zinc up 2% in London.\n\nFed Chair Powell talked up a “clear improvement” in the US economic outlook as the bank kept borrowing costs on hold on Wednesday. His tenure ends in June, after which President Donald Trump may be better positioned to step up his campaign for lower rates.\n\n“Under the cycle in which the US maintains interest-rate cuts, the expectation for upward movement in copper prices has not changed,” said Chi Kai, chief investment officer at Shanghai Cosine Capital Management Partnership. “As for how high prices can rise, there is no clear expectation as long as the US continues to push AI, chips and power construction.”\n\nInvestors have been flocking in particular to metals needed in major growth markets. Tesla Inc.’s plan to spend $20 billion this year shifting resources to robotics and AI has underscored investment prospects. Copper, aluminum and tin would all be beneficiaries.\n\nBut the rally has been broad-based, with iron ore futures in Singapore gaining as much as 2.5%.\n\nThe advance in metals came after a gauge of the US currency sank to its lowest level in more than four years, with Trump signaling he was unconcerned by the weakness. That slide makes commodities more attractive for many buyers.\n\nThere are plenty of voices warning that the spectacular gains in metals have run ahead of real-world demand. There’s likely a “technical adjustment” coming as physical buyers in China balk at higher prices, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. co-head of China equities Trina Chen told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday.",

The S&P 500 Index fell 1.26%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.571%. An equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 Index traded down 0.318%.\n\n“Investors are selling because they probably realized they are not going to make as much money on the AI theme as they hoped for half a year ago,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. “The AI theme is overcrowded, and investors are revaluing the AI trade, so they are re-weighting big-tech stocks in their portfolios.”\n\nShares of Microsoft declined after the company reported record spending and slowing cloud sales growth on Thursday, fueling concerns that it could take longer than expected for the firm’s AI investments to pay off. Capital expenditures for the fiscal second quarter hit $37.5 billion, up 66% from a year earlier and exceeding analyst estimates for $36.2 billion.\n\nIts performance stands in sharp contrast to Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. The stock traded 7.74% higher on Thursday, with analysts saying its stronger-than-expected revenue outlook supports its massive capital spending for the next year.\n\n“The AI theme, and who benefits from the AI capex going forward, remains the largest driver of factor and market cap calls,” said Dennis DeBusschere, president and chief market strategist at 22V Research.\n\nInvestors will get another chance to assess the megacap technology space after markets close Thursday, when Apple Inc. is due to report results.\n\nIn Washington, US President Donald Trump and Democrat Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are reportedly nearing a deal to avert a government shutdown. Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank, said that with funding expiring this weekend, “the US is creeping too close for comfort” to a stoppage.\n\nOfficial data showed the US trade deficit widened in November from the lowest level since 2009 as imports rebounded and exports fell. The goods and services trade gap nearly doubled from the prior month to $56.8 billion, Commerce Department data showed Thursday. The 94.6% widening was the largest since 1992, while the shortfall for the month exceeded all projections in a Bloomberg survey of economists.\n\nSeparately, initial jobless claims for the last week came in ahead of expectations, while continuing claims fell.

        "full_content": "Brent crude futures topped $71 a barrel for the first time since August after US President Donald Trump warned Iran to make a nuclear deal or face military strikes.\n\nThe global oil benchmark rose as much as 5.1%, while US counterpart West Texas Intermediate topped $66 amid the renewed risk of conflict that could disrupt crude exports out of Iran or ripple effects across global markets if a critical shipping route is blocked.\n\nIn a social media post on Wednesday, Trump said that US ships he ordered to the region were ready to fulfill their mission “with speed and violence, if necessary.” The commodity rallied even higher after the Associated Press reported that Iran issued a warning to ships at sea that it planned to run a drill next week that would include live firing in the Strait of Hormuz, citing two Pakistani security officials and the EOS Risk Group.\n\nThe report stoked fears of a potential closure of the narrow passage that separates Iran and the Arabian peninsula, through which about a fifth of the world’s oil passes. Iran itself accounts for about 3% of global supply, producing roughly 3.3 million barrels per day.\n\nCrude has rallied so far in 2026, countering expectations for a market pressured by significant oversupply. Instead, geopolitical tensions from Iran to Venezuela and major supply disruption in Kazakhstan have helped to bolster prices.\n\nTrump’s latest threats have injected a risk premium into prices. Bullish call options have been more expensive than bearish puts for the longest stretch in about 14 months as traders seek to protect against the risk of a new confrontation between the US and Iran. Bullish option additions have also grown at the fastest pace in at least six years.\n\n“The potential for Iran getting hit has escalated the geopolitical premium of oil prices by potentially $3 to $4 a barrel,” Citigroup analysts including Anthony Yuen said in a note. “Oil prices can stay more elevated than many had expected, despite markets starting the year anticipating large oversupply.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly issued warnings on Iran, but those have most recently been linked to Tehran’s deadly crackdown on protests rather than its nuclear activities. The US president previously said the regime’s atomic program was “obliterated” in strikes in June that targeted three facilities.\n\nIn response, Iran has said it stands ready for dialogue but warned it would respond with unprecedented force if pushed. Tehran has stepped up diplomacy with key powers in the Middle East as it looks to head off more conflict with US.",

        "full_content": "Microsoft Corp. plunged the most in almost six years after reporting record spending and slowing cloud sales growth, fueling investor concerns that it could take longer than expected for the company’s AI investments to pay off.\n\nThe shares sank by as much as 11% to $429.24, for the biggest intraday slide since March 2020.\n\nCapital expenditures for the fiscal second quarter hit $37.5 billion, up 66% from a year earlier and exceeding analyst estimates for $36.2 billion.\n\nThe Azure cloud-computing unit posted a 38% revenue gain during the quarter when adjusting for currency fluctuations, just meeting analysts’ projections. That growth rate slowed — by a percentage point — from the prior quarter. The company expects Azure sales to rise 37% to 38% in the current quarter.\n\n“One of the core issues that is weighing on investors is cap ex is growing faster than we expected, and maybe Azure is growing a little bit slower than we expected,” Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said during an analysts’ call. Investors, he said, were concerned about the return on that spending.\n\nChief Financial Officer Amy Hood responded by saying that a chunk of cloud capacity is going toward internal teams, which boosts products such as Copilot. Had all of the new capacity gone toward Azure, the growth rates would have been notably higher, she said.\n\nThe world’s largest software maker has experienced rapid growth in its cloud computing business, thanks in part to a landmark partnership with leading artificial intelligence startup OpenAI. But despite spending heavily on data centers, Microsoft has struggled to get capacity online quickly enough to meet demand.\n\nMicrosoft has been rushing to bake AI tools, including those powered by OpenAI, into its products, betting that chatbots and automation technology will boost sales of the company’s productivity software and cloud services.\n\nDuring the analyst call, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said companies are now paying for 15 million subscriptions to the M365 Copilot, Microsoft’s main AI tool for office workers. Adoption is growing among the company’s enormous base of corporate users, Nadella said.\n\nTotal sales increased 17% to $81.3 billion during the quarter, while profit was $5.16 a share, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. The net income figure was boosted by gains from Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI, which lifted per-share earnings by $1.02.\n\nAnalysts had expected sales of $80.3 billion and per-share earnings of $3.92.\n\nThe value of commitments from customers that Microsoft expects to materialize as sales in future years more than doubled from a year earlier, primarily the result of a new, $250 billion deal with OpenAI. The startup accounted for 45% of Microsoft’s backlog, which stood at $625 billion at the end of December.\n\nMicrosoft is the first of the Big Three cloud services companies to report quarterly financial results this year. Alphabet Inc. is scheduled to release its earnings on Feb. 4, Amazon.com Inc. the following day.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta Platforms Inc. got a more positive investor reception after saying it’s spending more than anticipated to build out its AI business. As part of its quarterly earnings report Wednesday, Meta, the owner of Facebook, said full-year capital expenditures will be $115 billion to $135 billion, exceeding the $110.6 billion average analyst estimate — and the shares jumped about 7% in extended trading.",

        "full_content": "India’s current inflation trajectory is unlikely to see any material jump with the new CPI weights, with the reading expected to be only 20–30 basis points higher on average, according to a report released by State Bank of India (SBI) researchers on January 29.\n\nAnalysing the recommendations of the statistics ministry’s expert group on revising the CPI base year to 2024, SBI said that applying the new expenditure weights to the existing price indices results in only a marginal increase in headline inflation.\n\n“By considering the new weights on unchanged index, we have calculated new CPI with old indices and found that overall CPI will increase marginally by 20–30 bps. While, in the months when food inflation is higher, the new CPI will be lower by 20–30 bps,” the report noted.\n\nA key change in the new CPI series is a sharp reduction in the weight of food and beverages to 36.75 percent from 45.86 percent in the current 2012-based series.\n\nThe combined weight of transport, information and communication, for instance, rises to 12.41 percent from 8.59 percent, while recreation and culture nearly triples to 4.86 percent.\n\nThe new CPI (2024=100) will include 358 weighted items, up from 299 earlier, and adopt the latest COICOP 2018 classification to improve global comparability. Price collection will also expand to online platforms and e-commerce markets, while services such as telecom, OTT subscriptions will be captured more systematically.\n\nThe report comes on the day the Economic Survey noted that inflation, despite having an upward trajectory, is likely to be benign this fiscal and will remain within target levels.",

        "full_content": "Big Tech earnings so far this week have sent a clear warning: investors are willing to overlook soaring spending on artificial intelligence if it fuels strong growth, but are quick to punish companies that fall short.\n\nThe contrast was clear in Thursday's stock market reaction to earnings from Microsoft and Meta, highlighting how dramatically the stakes have changed since the launch of ChatGPT started the AI boom more than three years ago.\n\nShares of the Instagram parent surged more than 9% on strong sales, while those of Microsoft slumped 10% after its cloud business failed to impress.\n\nAfter riding its first-mover advantage with OpenAI to become the world's most valuable firm in 2024, Microsoft is now under growing investor pressure to justify its soaring capital outlay.\n\nMicrosoft reported revenue growth in its Azure cloud-computing business that was only slightly above expectations.\n\nIn contrast, AI bolstered ad targeting at Meta, boosting revenue by 24% in the December quarter and aiding a rosy first-quarter forecast. The results show that the Facebook owner's gains from AI were helping fund its capital spending, which is expected to jump as much as 87% to $135 billion this year.\n\n\"Meta's headline numbers are a really interesting reflection of the market's attitude toward spending in the AI space,\" said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.\n\n\"All else equal, the market would typically be concerned, but they have a big revenue guide for the first quarter.\"\n\nMICROSOFT MIGHT HAVE AN OPENAI PROBLEM\n\nMicrosoft also faced pressure after a disclosure that OpenAI, its prized holding, accounts for 45% of its cloud backlog. Investors are worried that some $280 billion could be at risk as the unprofitable startup loses momentum in the AI race.\n\nThe ChatGPT creator had issued an internal \"code-red\" in December after Google's Gemini 3 launched to positive reviews and is playing catch-up in AI coding to Anthropic's Claude Code, which has hit an annualised run rate of more than $1 billion.\n\n\"Microsoft's deep ties to OpenAI underpin its leadership in enterprise AI, but they also introduce concentration risk,\" said Zavier Wong, market analyst at eToro.\n\nMicrosoft predicted Azure growth to stay stable in the period from January to March at 37% to 38%, after slowing in the last three months of 2025, partially due to AI chip capacity constraints.\n\n\"If I had taken the graphics processing units that just came online in the first quarter and second quarter, and allocated them all to Azure, the KPI (growth) would have been over 40%,\" Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood said on a post-earnings call.\n\nShe added that the use of chips for internal development efforts had limited the growth.\n\nMETA BETS ON AI'S COMPOUNDING EFFECT\n\nFor Meta, the revenue growth underscored that its AI pivot was paying off and helping the company catch up to early leaders.\n\nIts revenue rose 24% in the fourth quarter and Meta forecast growth to accelerate as much as 33% in the current quarter.\n\nThe company is racking up bills at large cloud providers, such as Alphabet's Google, which bodes well for the search giant's results next week. Alphabet shares rose 1.6%.\n\nUsing AI \"will both improve the quality of the organic experience and of advertising,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said.\n\n\"I think that will have a compounding effect,\" he added, as Meta predicted a jump of 43% in total expenses this year to $169 billion.\n\nTESLA SET TO DOUBLE OUTLAY THIS YEAR\n\nGrowing spending was also the theme at Elon Musk's Tesla, which will double outlay this year to more than $20 billion as it pivots to AI, humanoid robots and personal vehicles that can drive themselves.\n\nThe company also reported quarterly profit and revenue that were above expectations, pushing its shares up 2.9%.\n\nAnalysts said the results left some mismatch between corporate AI goals and investors' demand for payoffs.\n\n\"The market appears to be questioning whether these massive capital expenditure hikes will generate sufficient returns,\" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.\n\n\"This reflects a growing divide between tech companies' AI ambitions and Wall Street's patience for open-ended investment cycles.\"",

        "full_content": "India’s quick commerce market is going through a phase of sustained competitive intensity that is distorting growth outcomes, according to Amitesh Jha, chief executive of Instamart.\n\nSpeaking during Swiggy’s Q3FY26 earnings call, Jha said “irrationality” in the market has emerged as a key headwind for growth and is already impacting listed players. He added that Swiggy expects this environment to persist as new entrants continue to spend aggressively on customer acquisition.\n\n“Growth has many reasons for not happening, primarily due to the irrationality in the market, which has impacted both listed players,” Jha said, adding that the company believes such competitive behaviour will continue to weigh on growth in the near term.\n\n‘Good growth’ versus growth bought through discounts\n\nJha was unequivocal in drawing a line between what Swiggy considers healthy growth and growth driven by aggressive discounting.\n\n“We are not going to throw good money at bad growth,” he said, stressing that the company is unwilling to compromise margins in pursuit of headline numbers. While Swiggy could show higher order volumes by deploying more capital, Jha said such growth would not translate into sustainable leadership.\n\n“If our ambition is real market leadership, it is never going to happen by spending tons of good money on essentially buying growth,” he said.\n\nAccording to Jha, discount-heavy strategies are creating behaviour where customers move rapidly between platforms with little loyalty, weakening long-term unit economics.\n\nThat stance was echoed in the company’s shareholder letter, where Sriharsha Majety, group chief executive officer, said recent efforts to lower consumer-side monetisation had failed to deliver meaningful returns.\n\n“Our recent investments into lower consumer-side monetization have not yielded the desired incremental order-growth, especially at the bottom of the AOV-pyramid; and are being reviewed,” Majety said. “We have consciously chosen not to participate in deep-discount-driven, purely-volume-focussed growth that sacrifices AOVs and margins.”\n\nOrder growth without basket expansion a red flag\n\nJha also flagged a structural issue emerging from the current phase of competition: rising order volumes are not being accompanied by stronger consumer engagement.\n\n“Whenever we have seen order growth for any of these platforms, the basket size has not increased. In fact, they have decreased,” he said, arguing that this indicates growth that is neither healthy nor sustainable.\n\nSwiggy, he added, has consciously chosen not to compete in areas where growth is driven primarily by such metrics, even if it means foregoing short-term gains. “We can do more numbers to show higher OPD (orders per day) by putting more money into growth, but we don’t believe that is the right structural growth,” Jha said.\n\nFocus on retention, not discount-seeking users\n\nAs competitive intensity has picked up since October, Jha said Swiggy expects elevated spending by new entrants to continue. However, he expressed confidence that the market will eventually correct as platforms focus more on retention than acquisition.\n\n“New entrants are going after the metric of orders, not on the orders that ultimately matter to end consumers,” he said, adding that retention will ultimately depend on the strength of the core value proposition.\n\nJha said Swiggy is comfortable losing discount-seeking customers in the short term, arguing that long-term loyalty in quick commerce will be driven by assortment depth, availability and speed rather than sustained incentives.\n\n“Investing good money into bad ways to make customers mature is not a priority,” he said, adding that customers acquired primarily through discounts tend to leave once incentives are withdrawn.",

The rally was driven by strong demand for safe-haven assets, strong inflows into ETFs, and a weak US dollar,\" Saumil Gandhi, Senior Analyst, Commodities at HDFC Securities told PTI.\n\nHe noted that ongoing geopolitical tensions and global economic uncertainty have reinforced gold and silver's role as preferred hedges against risk, prompting investors to increase allocations to precious metals.\n\nMeanwhile, India's gold demand declined 11 pc in 2025 and is expected to be around 700 tonne this year, weighed down by record-high prices and changing consumer buying patterns, the World Gold Council (WGC) said in a report on Thursday.\n\nOverall gold demand in India fell 11 per cent to 710.9 tonnes in 2025 and is expected to be between 600 and 700 tonnes in 2026, according to the WGC's Full-Year 2025 Gold Demand Trends report.\n\nIn 2024, the overall gold demand stood at 802.8 tonnes.\n\nHowever, in value terms, skyrocketing prices boosted demand by 30 per cent to Rs 7,51,490 crore, compared to Rs 5,75,930 crore in the previous year.\n\n\"India's gold market in Q4 2025 clearly reflected the dual impact of record-high prices and shifting consumer behaviour. Total gold demand for the quarter stood at 241.3 tonne, marking a 9 per cent decline compared to Q4 2024.\n\n\"However, this moderation in volume was more than offset by a sharp rise in value, with overall gold demand increasing 49 per cent year-on-year to approx. Rs 3,03,470 crore,\" WGC Regional CEO, India, Sachin Jain, told PTI.\n\nIn the international market, gold increased USD 177.14, or 3.3 per cent, to touch a fresh peak of USD 5,595.02 per ounce.\n\n\"Spot gold posted its largest-ever intraday gain to hit a fresh record high of USD 5,595, driven by heightened geopolitical tensions after the US President Donald Trump threatened Iran with dire consequences to return to talks to reach a new deal on its nuclear programme,\" Praveen Singh, Research Analyst, Mirae Asset Sharekhan, said.\n\nThe yellow metal prices were also boosted after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that Trump could make an announcement \"in the next week or so\" about who he will pick to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve.\n\nSpot silver advanced sharply, rising USD 3.59, or 3.07 per cent, to hit a lifetime high of USD 120.45 per ounce in overseas trade.\n\nSandip Raichura, CEO of Retail Broking and Distribution & Director, PL Capital, said, \"Gold price movements based on the past may no longer work as we believe the world is witnessing a once in a century phenomenon and therefore gold could head much higher in the next two years, possibly crossing USD 8,000 by 2027.\" According to WGC, global demand for gold has crossed 5,000 tonnes to reach a new all-time high in 2025, mainly driven by investments.\n\nTotal gold demand hit a new all-time high of 5,002 tonnes in 2025, up from 4,961.9 tonne in the previous year, as the investment demand surged to 2,175.3 tonne compared to 1,185.4 tonne in 2024, driven by safe-haven and diversification factors, WGC said.",

We are looking for partners for offloading of shares. We hope to come out with an expression of interest calling interested parties shortly, though we have time till 2030, which is the asset monetisation deadline set by the government,” Arunangshu Sarkar, director—strategy & corporate affairs, ONGC, said on the sidelines of the India Energy Week.\n\nONGC owns 95.69% stake in OPaL while GAIL (India) Limited holds 4.19% stake and Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) another 0.12%. OPaL has a petrochemical complex in Dahej in Gujarat and has a capacity to produce 1.5 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) of polymers and 0.5 mmtpa of chemicals.\n\nIn 2025, OPaL received the final approval for its exit from the Dahej Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and operate as a Domestic Tariff Area (DTA) unit in order to cater to the domestic market.\n\nRecognizing its long-term potential and to address OPaL’s financial challenges, ONGC undertook a capital restructuring of Rs 18,365 crore and exited from SEZ area.\n\nIn parallel, to ensure feedstock stability and reduce reliance on volatile LNG markets, the government had approved allocation of up to 3.2 MMSCM/day of gas from new wells. “These interventions are poised to significantly enhance OPaL’s operational performance and sustainability, positioning it as a value-accretive asset in ONGC’s integrated energy portfolio,” the company had said in its annual report FY25.\n\nThe company sold 1785 KT of petchem products during FY25 against 1769 KT during FY24, while its revenue from operations stood at Rs 14,804 crore during FY25 compared to Rs 14,307 crore during FY24, as per ONGC’s annual report for 2024-25.\n\nThe director said that the upstream major has further planned to develop 50-55 MW (megawatt) of small modular reactors for its own captive use.\n\n“Already we have done EoI (Expression of Interest) and all. We have received a lot of interest. We are planning for 50-55 MW of SMRs that will be used as captive power in our own plants,” Sarkar said.\n\nWhen asked about the company’s plans in LNG sourcing, Sarkar said that the company is targeting both term and spot purchases of gas.\n\nThe company through its joint venture with Japan’s Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd (MOL), has recently signed Ship Building Contracts (SBCs) with Samsung Heavy Industries, South Korea, for the construction of two Very Large Ethane Carriers (VLECs).\n\nSpeaking on the development, Sarkar said that the agreement will ensure regular supply of ethane after Qatar stops supplying rich gas (ethane and propane) starting 2028.\n\nThe capacity of each carrier is expected to be 50 kilo tonnes and will be developed by 2028, Sarkar said. The vessels are expected to transport about 600 KTPA of ethane for OPaL.",

Most of the approvals have been secured barring a couple of countries,” Ramanan said.\n\nIn July 2025, Tata Motors, through its commercial vehicle business, announced the acquisition of Iveco Group, the world’s fifth-largest commercial vehicle manufacturer. The transaction marked the company’s biggest overseas deal to date.\n\n“We expect all the approvals to be in place by around mid-March, which was the earlier timeline that we were talking about. Our earlier timeline of completing the acquisition was Q1 FY27, and that is on track,” Ramanan added.\n\nThe company also said the separation of Iveco’s defence business—excluded from the Tata Motors deal—is progressing as scheduled. “From the Iveco side, this has been confirmed very clearly, that the committed timeline will be met,” Ramanan said.\n\nIveco informed shareholders on January 23, 2026, that an Extraordinary General Meeting to authorise the distribution of the net proceeds from the sale of its defence business to Leonardo S.p.A. is expected to be held in the second half of March 2026.\n\nThe company had earlier stated in July 2025 that if the sale to Leonardo is not completed on or before March 31, 2026, it would initiate steps to spin off the defence business through a statutory demerger. Under that plan, the defence unit would be transferred to a newly incorporated entity under Dutch law.",

        "full_content": "Digital insurer ACKO Life has announced that it will exclusively sell life insurance that is not linked to investments or income plans, the company founder Varun Dua said in a social media post.\n\nThe life insurance industry usually relies on life insurance products that guarantee fixed income and returns.\n\n“Investment-linked insurance products lure you with the promise of 'getting something back'. Inflated premium, inadequate cover and investment 'returns' that an FD would outperform. At ACKO Life, we made the hard choice of not mixing life insurance,” Acko founder Varun Dua said in a LinkedIn post.\n\nSuch quasi-investment products dilute the original life insurance purpose, while as an investment product, it does not deliver good returns as well, the company said.\n\nDua added that such practices dilute protection with 50 other 'benefits' and add confusion for end-consumers.\n\n“The move positions Acko as an ‘Unmixed’ insurer, prioritising high-value, low-cost life cover as a direct counter to the systemic issues plaguing the Indian insurance sector,” the company said.\n\nAcko’s announcement comes amidst the new insurance bill, which has flagged mis-selling as one of the key issues plaguing the industry. According to recent IRDAI data a 14.3% year-on-year surge in grievances related to Unfair Business Practices (UFBP), or mis-selling.\n\nWhile total life insurance premiums have grown to nearly $100 billion, national insurance penetration has declined to around 2.7 percent of the country’s GDP.\n\nHowever, the high premium masks the widening Mortality Protection Gap—the financial shortfall families face upon the death of a primary earner. This gap has surged 35% since 2017, according to data from a report by the Swiss Re Institute. India’s underpenetration meant that the gap is much wider in the country in practice.\n\nAcko said that by focussing on pure term life insurance, the company is looking to make insurance affordable and transparent. It said that this could help the Bengaluru-based company to drive up the penetration, apart from increasing consumer trust in the sector.",

        "full_content": "India’s Economic Survey aims to deliver a comprehensive, data-driven assessment of the economy's performance.Its significance lies in serving as a policy blueprint that flags key challenges and reform priorities to inform Budget decisions and signal government thinking to investors.\n\nAs expected, external challenges occupy considerable space in the latest Economic Survey—understandably so, amid escalating geopolitical tensions, no respite from Trump tariffs, and a weakening rupee (down 6.5% since April 2025) amid volatile capital flows that are roiling the country’s stock market.\n\nThe other major concerns highlighted by the Survey include the high cost of capital, underperformance of manufacturing and its limited integration with global value chains (GVCs), state-level fiscal populism, unbalanced use of agricultural inputs and low farm productivity, urban governance and stressed urban infrastructure, along with issues related to unemployment and public health.\n\nThe Survey argues that the world is shifting toward a phase of“managed disorder,”where trade policy is increasingly shaped by “security considerations” rather than “cost efficiency.” Coercive trade measures are replacing commitment to multilateral trade rules, leading to a realignment of supply chains. In India’s case,services trade surpluses and remittances are insufficientto offset large merchandise trade deficits. As a result, India depends on foreign capital inflows to maintain a healthy balance of payments, and any disruption in capital flows affects rupee stability and investor confidence.\n\nIt further argues that India’s high cost of capital is a structural outcome of persistent current account deficits and dependence on foreign savings. Reducing this cost durably requires transforming India into a“surplus-generating economy” through export-led growth and deeper integration with production networks.While services have been the mainstay, they are not a substitute for a robust “goods-based export ecosystem”. India needs to move from mere “strategic resilience” to“strategic indispensability”by becoming an essential, non-substitutable node in global value chains.\n\nWhat can be expected in the Union Budget\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the following can be expected from the upcoming Union Budget on Sunday:\n\n# The Budget is likely to emphasise the importance of free trade agreements (FTAs) in boosting exports andreiterate its commitment to expediting pending trade deals,especially the one with the US. To support manufacturing competitiveness and goods exports, further rationalisation of import duties is expected to address what is called the inverted duty structure—higher duties on raw materials and intermediates and lower duties on finished goods.Lowering duties on key industrial inputs, such as textile fibres, is expected to reduce production costs for downstream industries.Further withdrawal or rationalisation of Quality Control Orders (QCOs)that make it difficult to source inputs may also be announced.\n\n# We can also expect expansion of the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to more industries to boost exports and support job creation. As the Survey argues that the key to rupee stability lies in exports, the Budget is likely to considerexpanding and strengthening export promotion missions, along with increased export incentives for labour-intensive industries badly affected by Trump’s tariffs. Export facilitation measures, including further rationalisation of customs rules and regulations, can be expected.\n\n# Rising revenue deficits and unconditional cash transfers by states pose risks by “crowding out growth-enhancing capital expenditure”. This fiscal indiscipline at the state level increasingly affects the cost of sovereign borrowing. Therefore, Budget 2026 may further strengthen theSpecial Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI)framework, perhaps by introducing stricter performance-linked conditionalities that reward states for reducing revenue deficits while maintaining capital expenditure.\n\n# Proposals to deepen the corporate bond market—reducing reliance on bank-led debt and lowering the cost of capital for firms—are expected to boost private capex. Some announcements to assure foreign investors on tax certainty are also likely. However, given fiscal constraints, the government is unlikely to reduce or remove long-term capital gains tax that may not be liked by the country’s financial markets.\n\n# Indian crop yields continue to trail global averages due to technological and climatic constraints, as highlighted by the Survey. A major challenge is the distortedN:P:K fertiliser ratio,driven by excessive urea use, which is degrading soil health and lowering productivity. To restore soil health and boost farm output, the Budget may consider aphased re-engineering of the fertiliser subsidy programme.\n\nTaken together, the Economic Survey sets out a clear diagnosis of India’s structural constraints and the reform direction needed to sustain growth in an increasingly fragmented global economy. Budget 2026 is therefore likely to prioritise export competitiveness, lower the cost of capital, reinforce fiscal discipline, and address long-standing productivity challenges across manufacturing and agriculture. The credibility of the Budget will ultimately rest on whether it can translate the Survey’s strategic intent into concrete, implementable policy actions.\n\n(Ritesh Kumar Singh is a business economist and CEO, Indonomics Consulting Private Limited.

        "full_content": "Tesla Inc. will spend over $20 billion on a dramatic reshuffling of factory lines reflecting Elon Musk’s repositioning of the carmaker coming off a multiyear sales slump.\n\nThe capital expenditures planned for 2026 — more than double last year’s outlay and almost twice as much as Wall Street was expecting — will go to ramping up production of cars, batteries and robots across half a dozen plants. To make room for new Optimus humanoids, Tesla will discontinue its two oldest vehicles, the Model S sedan and Model X SUV.\n\n“We’re making very, very big investments,” Musk said on a call after Tesla released better-than-expected quarterly results. Tesla shares rose more than 3% as of 5:35 a.m. Thursday in New York, before the start of regular trading.\n\nTesla also announced a surprise agreement to invest about $2 billion into Musk’s money-losing artificial intelligence startup, xAI, and signaled it’s likely to build a semiconductor manufacturing facility. The moves underscore Tesla’s ambitions to reorient around AI, driverless technology and robots at the expense of its car business, which faces more challenges in 2026 after consecutive annual sales declines.\n\nInvestors have broadly supported the reinvention, even as the new business lines either remain far off or uncertain to succeed. Neither the broader auto industry’s EV winter nor Tesla’s earnings beat garnered much attention on Wednesday’s call.\n\n“This quarter officially marks the fundamental shift from EV company to an all-in bet on robotaxi, energy and Optimus,” said Andrew Rocco, an analyst with Zacks Investment Research. “It looks like they’re almost ready to tear off the Band-Aid on the EV business and go full in on autonomy.”\n\nTesla agreed this month to acquire preferred shares in xAI as part of the closely held company’s latest funding round. The companies also entered into a “framework” accord to strengthen their relationship and “enhance Tesla’s ability to develop and deploy AI products and services into the physical world,” the company said in its earnings release.\n\nThe investment highlights the deepening ties between Musk’s business interests and reinforces the growing focus on AI.\n\nThe xAI agreement will likely be welcomed by many investors and overshadow the earnings results, said Matt Maley, chief market strategist for Miller Tabak + Co.\n\n“If Tesla is going to do as well as the bulls are thinking, it’s going to be with the robotaxi and robotics,” Maley said. “So, this investment is exactly what the bulls wanted to hear.”\n\nWhile Musk has previously voiced support for Tesla investing in xAI, the move follows an unsuccessful shareholder vote on the prospect in November. While more of Tesla’s shareholders voted for a nonbinding measure encouraging an investment, a significant number of abstentions meant the measure didn’t pass. Still, Tesla said then that it would continue to explore the possibility.\n\nThe two companies already work together. Tesla has sold Megapack energy storage systems to xAI, and xAI’s Grok chatbot is integrated into some Tesla vehicles. Bloomberg reported earlier this month that xAI told investors its aims to build AI will eventually power humanoid robots such as Optimus.\n\nTesla’s adjusted earnings dropped to 50 cents a share in the quarter, exceeding analysts’ average estimate. The company snapped a streak of four quarters in which profit on that basis was weaker than expected.\n\nMusk has previously warned Tesla was headed for a rough patch navigating lower EV demand and waning US subsidies. While the company is finally bringing its long-planned Semi truck to market this year and will soon start making its two-door, two seat Cybercab, production of the Model S and X will wind down in the next quarter. The S, which costs about $95,000, and the X, with a price tag of nearly $100,000, are much lower-volume vehicles compared with Tesla’s more affordable 3 and Y models.\n\nThe profit beat helps offset disappointment stemming from a steady decline in vehicle sales. Tesla earlier this month reported a 9% decline in 2025 deliveries. The company ended the year with a 16% quarterly vehicle sales drop, its steepest decline yet.\n\nAn increasingly crowded EV market, the end of US tax credits for EV purchases and a backlash against Musk’s polarizing politics and his role in the Trump administration contributed to the company’s woes.\n\nOne of the company’s lucrative revenue streams — selling regulatory compliance credits to other carmakers — also is coming under pressure, with sales falling 22% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. That income has dropped since the US eliminated penalties for automakers exceeding fuel-economy standards.\n\nDue to the regulatory credit revenue slide and drop in vehicle deliveries, Tesla’s annual revenue declined for the first time.\n\nThe company reported for the first time that it has 1.1 million active subscribers for its Full Self-Driving system, the suite of assistance features that drivers need to constantly supervise. Musk announced recently that FSD will transition to a subscription-only model starting next month.\n\nTesla said it aims to deploy robotaxis in Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Orlando, Tampa and Las Vegas in the first half of this year. The only city where the company has offered rides without safety drivers is Austin, and the business fell well short of Musk’s predictions for expansion last year.\n\nThe company also operates a ride-share service via the same app in the San Francisco Bay area with safety drivers behind the wheel. It’s already secured permits for testing in Nevada and Arizona.",

        "full_content": "For many Indians, owning a house is still one of life’s biggest financial goals. Earlier, people often waited until retirement to build a home using their savings. Today, easier access to home loans means many people start construction much earlier, even while they’re still building their careers.\n\nIf you’re planning to construct a house on your own plot, it’s important to know how homeloansfor self-construction work, when EMIs begin, and how tax benefits really apply.\n\nCan you get a home loan for building a house?\n\nYes, but with a few differences.\n\nBanks and housing finance companies generally treat loans for ready-to-move homes and under-construction flats similarly when it comes to interest rates, tenure and broad eligibility. The key difference is in how the money is released.\n\nFor self-construction on your own land, fewer lenders are willing to finance the project. Those that do usually offer either a construction loan or a composite loan that covers both the plot and the construction cost.\n\nIn such cases, the lender does not hand over the full loan amount upfront. You are expected to first put in your share of the money. The loan is then disbursed in stages, linked to the progress of construction.\n\nHow disbursements actually happen\n\nMoney is released in tranches as construction moves ahead. To trigger each disbursement, you typically need to submit certificates from your architect or civil engineer confirming the stage of construction. Photographs of the site are also commonly required.\n\nSome lenders go a step further and send their own engineer to verify progress instead of relying only on your documents. This can slow things down slightly, but it’s standard practice.\n\nThe important thing to remember is that cash flow planning matters. You need enough funds to keep construction moving between disbursements.\n\nMany borrowers assume EMIs begin only after construction is fully completed. That’s not always true.\n\nWhile regular EMIs usually start once the entire loan has been disbursed, you may still have to pay interest on the amount already released during the construction phase. This is known as pre-EMI interest.\n\nPre-EMI payments are interest-only and do not reduce the principal. They can stretch for months or even years, depending on how long construction takes.\n\nWhat tax benefits can you claim?\n\nTax benefits for a self-construction home loan depend heavily on timing and the tax regime you choose.\n\nUnder Section 80C, you can claim up to Rs 1.5 lakh a year for principal repayment, along with other eligible investments. However, principal repayments made before the construction is completed do not qualify for this deduction.\n\nThere’s another catch. If you sell the house within five years from the end of the financial year in which you take possession, all the principal-related deductions you claimed earlier are reversed and added back to your income in the year of sale. This benefit is available only under the old tax regime.\n\nWhat about interest deductions?\n\nInterest on a home loan is treated more generously.\n\nYou can claim interest under Section 24(b) only after the construction is completed and you take possession of the house. But the interest you paid during the construction phase is not lost. It can be claimed in five equal instalments, starting from the year the house is completed, along with the regular interest for that year.\n\nFor self-occupied houses, the maximum interest deduction is Rs 2 lakh a year under the old tax regime. If construction is not completed within five years from the end of the year in which the loan was taken, this limit drops sharply to Rs 30,000.\n\nIf the property is let out, you can claim the full interest amount, although losses that can be set off against other income are capped at Rs 2 lakh a year.\n\nUnder the new tax regime, interest deduction is not available for self-occupied houses, and losses from house property cannot be adjusted against other income.\n\nOne small but important relief\n\nUnlike principal repayment benefits, interest deductions claimed under Section 24(b) are not reversed if you sell the house within five years of completion. That distinction often gets overlooked.\n\nBuilding your own house with a home loan can work well, but it requires careful planning. Disbursements are staggered, EMIs don’t always wait for completion, and tax benefits depend heavily on timelines and the tax regime you choose.\n\nBefore you begin construction, it helps to map out not just the cost of the house, but also how cash will flow during the build and when tax benefits will actually kick in. A little clarity upfront can prevent a lot of confusion later.",

        "full_content": "As the Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran had indicated in an opinion piece ahead of the Economic Survey, geopolitics and global uncertainty emerged as defining themes of the report. While these forces pose clear risks to India,the Survey underscored the imperative of strengthening domestic fundamentals to cushion against external shocks—recognising that the global environment may yet deteriorate. As the proverb goes,a house built on strong foundations can withstand any storm.\n\nThe first job was to ascertain how big the problem might get. To this end, the survey outlines three scenarios of various risk intensities. The ‘best-case’ scenario of a ‘managed disorder’, which was allocated 40-45% probability, final stress episodes, trade frictions and geopolitics introduce volatility and government intervention but do not trigger a systemic collapse.\n\nAlmost similar probability was allocated to the second scenario, which involved a disorderly multipolar breakdown, where geopolitical tensions intensify and countries face trade-offs between stability, growth and autonomy.\n\nA third and severe scenario, which received a 10-20% probability outlined a 2008 GFC-like effect, with broader risk-aversion with financial market as well as real economy implications.\n\nIndispensability through manufacturing\n\nBeyond the stage-setting, the survey portrayed inherent optimism on the Indian economy’s ability to fight these risks. While a lot of arguments were presented, there was a strong case for a single-minded focus on expanding manufacturing capabilities. Interestingly, manufacturing was framed as a \"disciplining system\" that would force improvements in logistics, power, and regulation because production failures in this sector are immediately and externally visible.\n\nThe emphasis was also on the economy finding its key bargaining chip, which will contribute to its “strategic indispensability”, i.e., integrate the Indian economy so deeply into global networks that others are invested in its continued functioning. This requires moving beyond assembly to high-tech manufacturing, as seen in the India Semiconductor Mission, which aims to secure domestic capacity in the \"heart\" of modern technology.\n\nThere were also suggestions on finetuning the AI adoption strategy to domestic realities. Instead of focusing on expansion of heavy compute infra which will not only add to the debt stock, but also strain existing resources, the preferred route would be to undertake a bottom-up AI strategy focused on application-specific, small models that are computationally efficient and tailored to local needs in health, agriculture, and education.\n\nState capacity and economic growth\n\nIn midst of these myriad changes, the survey does not lose sight of the importance of building the depth and quality of state capacity, particularly about the state’s ability to execute plans through administrative judgment and technical competence. After all, this was one of the reasons why aggressive increase in allocations towards capex spending, especially infrastructure, is ill-advised before strengthening capacity. In this context, the Survey identifies bureaucratic risk aversion as a significant hurdle, where good-faith decisions are often subjected to retrospective scrutiny, leading to policy inertia. To counter this, it advocates for the \"Entrepreneurial State\"—one that acts under uncertainty, learns from systematic experimentation, and corrects course without paralysis. It goes to provide the required reforms to enhance state capacity.\n\nIn all, the Economic Survey pegged FY27 GDP growth at 6.8% to 7.2%, slightly higher than street estimates, from a projected 7.4% in FY26. The FY27 Budget might undertake smaller steps to achieve few of the objectives outlined in the survey. Along with strong growth, the authorities will be keen to build and assert their strategic influence over time, with an immediate need to strengthen shock absorption mechanisms. An undervalued rupee for one does not seem to be raising the hackles for the time being.\n\n(Views are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.)",

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey's headlines are unabashedly positive, reiterating India's status as the world's fastest-growing major economy. GDP growth for the current fiscal year is 7.4%, though it is projected to moderate to between 6.8% and 7.2% over the next two fiscal years; the lower end of this range aligns with the IMF's estimates.\n\nSignificantly, the Survey reckons that potential growth has risen to 7% from current levels of 6.5%. Given current economic trajectories, this should translate into per capita income growth of over 5%. Furthermore, inflation is described as \"tamed and anchored,\" which may pave the way for interest rate cuts.\n\nIt hails the resilience of the Indian economy post the imposition of the ‘penal’ tariff of 25 percent by President Trump, raising the total 50%. It hails the slew of structural reforms, including the cut in GST and the implementation of the new labour codes. ”A sense of dynamism has taken hold in the government,” the survey says, seemingly crediting the economic reforms to the pressure created by the tariffs.\n\nThe survey posits that potential economic growth has risen from 6.5 percent to 7 percent boosted by sustained economic reforms intended to boost ease of doing business. Major steps include FDI reforms, the introduction of production-linked schemes (PLI), improving logistics, and simplifying tax laws. This has been supplemented by sustained investment in both physical and digital infrastructure. Effective capex in physical and digital, according to the survey, has reached 4 percent of GDP.\n\nAll this will lead to a rise in total factor productivity, a rise which translates into higher growth. TFP is something of a holy grail among economists. A rise in TFP implies greater efficiency due to smarter combinations of inputs of capital and labour. The survey estimates TFP growing at 1.9 percent between FY 26 and FY30, up from 1.7 percent in the immediate post-pandemic years.\n\nThat's only a return to the 1.9 percent growth between FY12-13 and FY 19-20. Similarly, the survey calculates a growth in capital stock of 7.6 percent in the next five fiscal years, higher than the 1.7 percent in the post-covid years. Between FY13 and FY20, growth was 7.6%.\n\nOngoing reforms, notably the free trade agreements (FTA) signed with the EU, UK and others, should further boost productivity. So should the investments in both physical and digital productivity.\n\nThe learning-by-doing, which will accompany the growth of new sectors such as semiconductors, electronics (a major success of the PLI policy) and defence equipment, should also help.\n\nThe survey argues that the higher cost of capital is high in India for structural reasons, namely the fact that the country has a persistent current account deficit. As a result, it needs to attract foreign capital for which it needs to pay a risk premium. Energy costs, too, need to come down.\n\nNonetheless, Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GDCF) now stands at 30.5 percent of GDP above the pre-pandemic average of 28.6 percent. GFCF as a percentage of GDP had been declining from FY13 to FY20 and further during the pandemic years, a trend that has now reversed.\n\nBoth consumption and investment are anchoring growth, the survey reiterates. The former stands at 61.5 percent of GDP in the first half of the current fiscal year, the highest since FY12.\n\nHowever, the Survey is far from Panglossian and posits that India is operating below its full strategic potential. Notably, the rupee is described as punching below its weight, causing foreign investors to pause.\n\nThe rupee's performance does not reflect India's \"stellar economic fundamentals\", according to the survey. It also flags the risk of what it refers to as \"disorderly multipolar breakdown\".\n\n“The paradox of 2025 is that India’s strongest macroeconomic performance in decades has collided with a global system that no longer rewards macroeconomic success with currency stability, capital inflows, or strategic insulation,” the survey complains.\n\nThe Survey also reiterates social concerns mentioned in previous editions, such as digital device addiction and obesity. It also flags the relatively low pay of gig workers, a topic of much recent debate.\n\n“The paradox of 2025 is that India’s strongest macroeconomic performance in decades has collided with a global system that no longer rewards macroeconomic success with currency\n\nstability, capital inflows, or strategic insulation,” the survey complains. Reducing imports sustainably by emulating the success of the electronics industry, which the survey hails, in other areas could resolve the conundrum.",

        "full_content": "As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, tax experts are increasingly calling for a reset of India’s long-term savings incentives, arguing that existing provisions have failed to keep pace with inflation, rising living costs and evolving employment patterns.\n\nA key area where taxpayers are demanding change is Section 80C of the Income-tax Act, which is available under the old tax regime, where the Rs 1.5 lakh deduction limit has remained unchanged for over a decade. Experts say this ceiling no longer reflects the financial realities of middle-class households that are simultaneously managing housing costs, education expenses and retirement planning. There is a strong expectation that Budget 2026 could raise this limit and extend enhanced deductions to the new tax regime as well, ensuring that long-term savings do not lose relevance as the simplified regime becomes the default.\n\nAccording to SR Patnaik, the current structure of Section 80C mixes long-term savings instruments with other eligible payments, diluting its effectiveness as a retirement-focused incentive. He believes carving out a separate, higher deduction exclusively for long-term savings could strengthen retirement readiness across income groups.\n\nBeyond deductions, experts are also pushing for reforms in capital gains and interest income taxation to revive investor confidence. Hari Raheja argues that long-term capital gains relief, preferential tax treatment for longer-tenure fixed deposits, and the reintroduction of tax-exempt dividends could meaningfully boost participation in financial markets. He also points to the need for innovative savings avenues, such as gold deposit schemes, and more liberal reinvestment limits in housing to channel household wealth into productive assets.\n\nThere is also growing support for separating genuine long-term savings from the crowded Section 80C basket. Ritika Nayyar notes that when multiple instruments compete for the same deduction limit, taxpayers often prioritise liquidity or deadline-driven options over long-term goals. A dedicated sub-limit for retirement-oriented products such as PPF, NPS and long-dated government bonds, she says, could encourage disciplined, goal-based saving and reduce the tendency for last-minute tax planning.\n\nBalancing long-term lock-ins with flexibility for younger investors remains another policy challenge. With job mobility and gig work becoming more common, experts stress that tax incentives must reward patience without trapping capital indefinitely. Gradually increasing tax benefits with longer holding periods, allowing limited early withdrawals, and enabling portability across jobs are seen as practical ways to make long-term saving less intimidating for younger earners.\n\nFor B. Shravanth Shanker, inflation-adjusted thresholds are critical to restoring the relevance of tax exemptions. He highlights the need to raise interest income deductions for both individuals and senior citizens, revisit stagnant homeloaninterest limits, and introduce targeted long-term capital gains relief to encourage genuine wealth creation. Importantly, he also flags gaps in the new tax regime, where the absence of dedicated retirement deductions could inadvertently weaken future financial security if left unaddressed.\n\nTaken together, these proposals point to a broader shift that experts hope Budget 2026 will initiate: moving tax policy away from fragmented, short-term incentives towards a clearer framework that rewards long-term commitment, supports retirement planning, and aligns household savings with India’s long-term growth needs.",

        "full_content": "India is the world’s fastest-growing major economy. The real question is, do you want to simply watch that growth, or actually own a part of it?\n\nThe difference between where you put your money can be dramatic. The same Rs 1 lakh could grow into Rs 10 lakh over time, or remain stuck closer to Rs 3 lakh, depending on how you invest. That gap is where stocks come in.\n\nFor many young Indians, especially Gen Z, the stock market still feels intimidating or premature. But understanding how the stock market works often changes that perception.\n\nA brief history of stock investing\n\nStock investing isn’t a modern invention. It began in the 1600s in Amsterdam, when the Dutch East India Company became the first firm to issue shares to the public, allowing ordinary people to own a piece of a business.\n\nIndia’s own stock market journey started in 1875 with the formation of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Today, India has two major exchanges, the BSE and the NSE, with millions of investors trading daily. From Infosys in the 1990s to Zomato’s IPO in 2021, equities have become the primary way Indians participate in the growth of companies they interact with every day.\n\nHow the stock market actually works\n\nAt its core, the stock market is a marketplace for ownership. When you buy shares of a company like Reliance or TCS, you are buying a small stake in that business.\n\nShare prices move based on demand and supply. If more investors want to buy a stock, its price rises; if more want to sell, it falls. Companies raise capital by issuing shares, and investors benefit as those businesses grow and become more profitable. When done right, it’s a mutually beneficial system, companies get funding, and investors get a chance to build wealth.\n\nWhy stocks deserve a place in your portfolio\n\nThere are four key reasons stocks remain one of the most powerful wealth-building tools:\n\nBeating inflation:Inflation in India averages around 5-6 percent. If your money is parked in savings accounts or fixed deposits earning similar returns, your purchasing power barely grows. Equities, on the other hand, have historically delivered returns of 10-12 percent over the long term, helping money grow faster than rising prices.Capital growth:Equities allow investors to participate in the growth of successful businesses. Early investors in companies like Infosys saw wealth creation that traditional instruments could never match.Dividend income:Some companies share profits with shareholders through dividends, offering a steady stream of passive income in addition to price appreciation.Diversification:You don’t need to bet on a single stock. Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds allow investors to spread money across sectors such as technology, pharma, and FMCG, reducing risk while staying invested in equities.\n\nIs your 20s too early to invest? Actually, it’s ideal\n\nIf there’s one word young investors should remember, it’s compounding. The earlier you start, the longer your money has to multiply. Starting in your 20s gives your investments decades to grow, dramatically increasing the final outcome. Waiting until your 30s or 40s can significantly reduce that potential.\n\nStocks are no longer just for seasoned traders or “Dalal Street veterans.” They are for first-job earners, startup dreamers, and digital natives who want their money to work as hard as they do.\n\nStart small. Stay consistent. Let time and compounding do the heavy lifting. Because while the best time to invest may have been yesterday, the second-best time is today.",

The objective of QCOs is to ensure that products sold in the domestic market meet stipulated quality standards, while avoiding market distortions and safeguarding consumer interests, it further added.\n\nThe Survey credited QCOs with delivering tangible gains in certain sectors. In toys, for instance, stricter quality norms helped curb sub-standard imports while also supporting the development of a domestic manufacturing base and boosting exports.\n\nHowever, the Survey cautioned that design and execution are also important, particularly given the structure of India’s industrial ecosystem. “While the rationale is clear, the design and implementation of QCOs should be grounded in economic practicality,” it said, warning that mandatory certification is not cost-free and can create frictions if rolled out without adequate preparation.\n\nThis risk is especially pronounced for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which account for a large share of India’s manufacturing base. Sudden or poorly sequenced certification requirements can raise compliance costs, disrupt production cycles and strain working capital for smaller firms, the Survey noted.\n\nThe document also flagged challenges arising from globalised supply chains.\n\n“QCOs on intermediates therefore require exceptional caution,” the Survey said, stressing the need for flexibility where domestic capacity does not exist, particularly given the complexity of modern global production networks.\n\nTo address these concerns, the Survey called for a forward-looking QCO framework with rigorous pre-notification assessments, calibrated transition timelines and adequate expansion of national testing and certification infrastructure.",

In the United States, the live music industry generated over $130 billion and supported more than 900,000 jobs in 2019. In the UK, music tourism alone contributed £6.6 billion ($8.1 billion) in 2022—around 0.3 percent of GDP—highlighting strong spillovers to hospitality, transport and retail,” it said.\n\nCreative industries contribute between 0.5 percent and over 7 percent of GDP.\n\nThe survey highlighted a shortage of large-scale live event venues, restrictions on foreign payments to overseas performers, and the requirement for 10-15 separate clearances for organising events.\n\nTo address these gaps, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is working on a Single Window Mechanism for Live Entertainment Permissions, including approvals from state governments. The Survey also suggested opening heritage monuments for events and easing visa and foreign-exchange approvals for international artists.\n\nWith better facilitation and integration into tourism and city-branding strategies, the Survey said, the concert economy could emerge as a meaningful driver of growth for media and entertainment, tourism and allied urban services.",

They tell you the policy lapsed, but the premium you paid has supposedly grown into a much larger amount. All you need to do, they say, is buy a new policy so the money can be “transferred” and refunded.\n\nIt sounds tempting. It is also completely false.\n\nFirst things first: Bima Lokpal does not call you\n\nThe Insurance Ombudsman, also called the Bima Lokpal, does not call policyholders to offer refunds. No government body, regulator or ombudsman reaches out to individuals and promises them with unclaimed insurance money.\n\nThey do not ask you to buy new policies. They do not route refunds through fresh investments. And they certainly do not promise windfalls over phone calls.\n\nAny caller claiming otherwise is lying.\n\nThese scams are effective precisely because the caller sounds extremely confident. Fraudsters often have access to old policy data. They may know your name, the year you bought the policy and even the premium amount. When they give all these details to you over the phone, it lowers your guard.\n\nThey also create urgency. You are told the money will be refunded only if you act quickly. This pressure is deliberate. It is meant to stop you from checking independently.\n\nIf you feel rushed, that itself is a warning sign.\n\nThe biggest red flag: “Buy a new policy to get your money”\n\nThere is no legitimate insurance process where you must purchase a new policy to unlock or refund money from an old one. Once you pay for a new policy, the money is usually gone, and the promised refund never shows up.\n\nThis “transfer-and-refund” story is entirely made up.\n\nHow lapsed policies actually work\n\nIf your old policy was a traditional plan like an endowment or money-back policy, and it lapsed before it built any surrender value, the premiums are typically forfeited. There is nothing to refund.\n\nIf it was a Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP), the fund value does not disappear. When the policy lapses, the money moves into a discontinuation fund. That amount can be withdrawn only after five years, and only after applicable charges are deducted.\n\nIn neither case does Rs 50,000 magically become Rs 5 lakh.\n\nIf you want to know the status of an old policy, contact the insurance company directly. Use the official customer care number or website listed on the insurer’s own page. You can check whether any fund value exists and whether anything is payable.\n\nDo not rely on unsolicited calls. Do not share documents, OTPs or personal details. And never make payments based on promises of refunds.\n\nThis is a scam, plain and simple. In insurance, guaranteed windfalls, urgent deadlines and requests to buy new policies to release old money are classic warning signs. When in doubt, cut the call and check directly with the insurer. If the money is real, it will still be there tomorrow.",

        "full_content": "As Budget 2026 approaches, household investors are not looking for dramatic tax cuts or new exemptions. What they want instead is clarity, tax rules that allow them to invest according to their risk profile.\n\nOver the past two years, industry experts say changes in the taxation of investment products have quietly altered investor behaviour. While some of these measures were introduced in the name of parity or simplification, the result for many retail investors has been confusion and, in some cases, higher risk-taking.\n\nDebt funds and the conservative investor dilemma\n\nOne of the clearest examples is debt mutual funds. After indexation benefits were removed in 2023, debt funds lost much of their appeal for long-term investors seeking stability and tax efficiency.\n\nRahul Bhutoria, Director and Co-founder of Valtrust, says the impact was swift. “When indexation benefit for debt mutual funds was removed in March 2023, long-term investors stepped back, leading to weakening of inflows,” he notes. For conservative households, debt funds no longer serve as a reliable low-risk allocation in the way they once did.\n\nImportantly, the change did not significantly alter bank deposit behaviour. According to Dr. Gaurav Kulshreshtha, Chief Investment Officer, Nexedge Capital, bank deposit growth has continued at around 10-12 percent year-on-year. What has changed is where conservative money is going.\n\n“In the pursuit of better post-tax returns, conservative capital is increasingly moving toward higher credit risk or unintended equity exposure,” Kulshreshtha says. This shift, driven largely by tax outcomes rather than suitability, undermines traditional asset allocation principles in personal finance.\n\nRestoring capital gains taxation for debt mutual funds and similar products is therefore a key expectation from Budget 2026, not to boost returns, but to re-establish debt as a sensible option for low-risk investors.\n\nEquity investing: STT plus Capital Gains Burden\n\nTax complexity is not limited to debt. Equity investors today deal with multiple layers of taxation across the investment lifecycle, from Securities Transaction Tax at purchase to expense ratios during holding and capital gains tax at exit.\n\nManish Kothari, CEO of ZFunds, believes simplification is long overdue. “A more streamlined tax structure across these layers would improve transparency, reduce confusion, and ease the overall burden on investors,” he says. For retail investors, understanding true post-tax returns remains a challenge.\n\nHybrids and pension funds: similar goals, different tax outcomes\n\nHybrid mutual funds add another layer of inconsistency. Two hybrid schemes with similar risk-return profiles can face very different tax treatment due to technical classification thresholds. “Two products delivering similar outcomes should not face different tax outcomes,” Kothari argues, adding that taxation should reflect the economic nature of the product rather than rigid definitions.\n\nA similar mismatch exists in retirement planning. He explains, “Pension-oriented mutual funds and the National Pension System (NPS) both aim to provide post-retirement security, yet differences in tax treatment often push investors toward one product purely for tax reasons.”",

The survey said the scheme provides structured incentives for shipbuilding within India, addressing cost disadvantages faced by domestic yards in global markets dominated by a few large players.\n\nSBFAS also includes a shipbreaking credit note of Rs 4,001 crore, aimed at promoting environmentally responsible recycling and supporting green shipbuilding practices. This aligns the shipbuilding push with India’s broader environmental and sustainability objectives, particularly as global shipping standards tighten around emissions and recycling norms.\n\nDedicated maritime financing architecture\n\nTo address long-standing financing constraints in the sector, the government has approved a Maritime Development Fund (MDF) of Rs 25,000 crore. According to the survey, the framework is intended to strengthen long-term sectoral financing, attract investment and promote public-private partnerships across shipbuilding and allied maritime activities.\n\nThe MDF comprises a Maritime Investment Fund of Rs 20,000 crore, with 49 percent participation from the Government of India, and an Interest Incentivisation Fund of Rs 5,000 crore designed to lower financing costs and improve project viability. The structure is aimed at crowding in private capital while reducing risk for lenders in a capital-intensive sector with long gestation periods, the survey said.\n\nScaling capacity and technology depth\n\nThe Shipbuilding Development Scheme (SbDS), with an outlay of Rs 19,989 crore, seeks to expand India’s shipbuilding capacity to 4.5 million gross tonnage annually. The survey said the scheme supports the development of greenfield mega shipbuilding clusters, modernisation of existing shipyards, and the provision of risk and insurance support for shipbuilding projects.\n\nIt also envisages the establishment of an India Ship Technology Centre to help develop domestic capabilities in shipbuilding design, manpower training, research and development, and coordination of testing facilities.\n\nAs part of the broader reform package, large ships above a specified size were included in the Infrastructure Harmonised Master List in September 2025. The move is intended to ease access to long-term finance by allowing eligible projects to tap infrastructure-linked funding channels, the Economic Survey said.",

These users saw net capital losses of Rs 1178 crores.\n\nFor Union Budget 2026, the crypto industry is seeking 30 percent capital gains tax rationalisation, provision for loss offset and re-evaluation of the 1 percent tax deducted at source (TDS).\n\nIndian exchanges directly deduct 1 percent TDS on all virtual digital asset transactions. At present, the TDS threshold is about Rs 10,000 per year for most categories of taxpayers, individuals and traders; and Rs 50,000 per year for small traders and specified persons.\n\nTotal TDS collected was at Rs 511.83 crores, out of which KoinX users contributed over Rs 130.16 crores (25.43 percent). Less than 5 percent of the users paid 87 percent of total TDS deducted.\n\nThe 1 percent TDS levied on transactions accounted for only about 0.60 percent of the overall turnover on domestic exchanges.\n\n“The 1% TDS on crypto transactions has become a significant liquidity factor in the Indian crypto market… This figure reflects transaction volume, not profitability. TDS is deducted per trade, making it a proxy for trading activity, not net gains,” the report noted.\n\nAgarwal explained, “During FY 2024–25, ₹19,280 crore of trading volume in our dataset occurred on Indian exchanges. Since TDS is deducted at 1% on sale transactions, the total TDS collected reflects only sell-side activity on domestic platforms, not total turnover.”\n\n“Additionally, a significant share of overall trading volume occurs on international exchanges, which further explains why TDS collections appear low relative to total trading volume,” he added.",

        "full_content": "India’s space sector has seen a sharp rise in participation from private entities, with more than 300 startups now operating in the segment, the Economic Survey 2026, released on January 29, has said.\n\nThe survey attributed the growth to the Space Sector Reforms of 2020 and the Indian Space Policy 2023, which created a formal framework for non-government entities (NGEs) to undertake activities alongside the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro).\n\nThe Indian Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) has emerged as the single-window agency to authorise and regulate private sector participation, the survey said .\n\nThe government has backed the ecosystem with dedicated funding mechanisms. In October 2024, the cabinet approved a  Rs 1,000-crore venture capital fund under IN-SPACe to support space startups, followed by the launch of a Rs 500 crore Technology Adoption Fund in February next.\n\nIn the startups sector, Skyroot Aerospace and Agnikul Cosmos have conducted successful sub-orbital launches in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Several startups, including Pixxel Space, Azista, Hex20 and TakeMe2Space, have successfully launched satellites, the survey said.\n\nMore than 70 technologies have been transferred from Isro to private industry, helping firms scale up production and enter commercial markets, it said, adding foreign investment norms have also been liberalised.\n\nThe survey positions private participation as central to India’s long-term space ambitions under Space Vision 2047, which includes the Bharatiya Antariksh Station by 2035 and a crewed lunar mission by 2040.\n\nUpcoming missions such as Chandrayaan-4, Chandrayaan-5/LUPEX, the Venus Orbiter Mission and the Next Generation Launch Vehicle will create further opportunities for industry collaboration and technology development.\n\nThe Economic Survey 2025–26, prepared under the supervision of chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran, was tabled in Parliament by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.",

        "full_content": "The key takeaway from the Economic Survey 2025-26 tabled in Parliament on Thursday is that the India’s macroeconomic sweet spot, which is the outcome of sustained economic reforms, is being tested by geopolitics and a changing global order.\n\nAn undertone of confidence in domestic demand and growth comes through in the resilient 6.8-7.2 per cent growth projection for FY2027. The Survey also revised the potential growth rate up to 7.0 per cent from 6.5 per cent three years ago attributing credit to reforms and public investment. “Growth is good; the outlook remains favourable; inflation is contained; rainfall and agricultural prospects are supportive; external liabilities are low; banks are healthy; liquidity conditions are comfortable; credit growth is respectable; corporate balance sheets are strong; and the overall flow of funds to the commercial sector is robust. Policy dynamism and purposeful governance reinforce this backdrop.”\n\nIndia exits a turbulent FY2026 and enters FY2027 in a position of macroeconomic strength, domestic growth, anchored inflation, and improving fiscal health. The survey takes cognisance of reforms across taxation, financing institutions, capital markets, digitisation, and infrastructure which helped medium-term stability.\n\nHowever, in the backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions, what built India’s resilience to keep the growth engine is infrastructure. The document reiterates the Centre’s 89 per cent increase in capital outlay from Rs 5.92 lakh crore in FY2022 to a budgeted allocation of Rs 11.21 lakh crore for FY2026.\n\nHighlighting the importance of investing in roads, railways, ports, airports, it states that the multiplier effect in economic growth is most pronounced in infra capital expenditure (capex). This means, for every rupee spent by the government in creating infrastructure, GDP gains worth Rs 2.5-Rs 3.5.\n\nThat said, when public capital expenditure on infrastructure has expanded significantly, the end-result depends upon quality of project plans and execution. Cost overruns as a result of delays in execution, incomplete reports or inaccurate assessments are a given.\n\nAnother pertinent point made is the calibrated shift needed by the private sector, mainly in manufacturing, from a model that looks to import substitution towards one that focuses on scale, competitiveness innovation and integration into the global value chains. Here, the survey calls out India Inc. for its unwillingness to take risks that are beneficial in the long run.Companies need to step on the capex pedaland take bigger risks, make investments with longer time horizons, become globally competitive, and avoid rent-seeking, oligopolistic tendencies. It needs to increase private sector investment in research and development, technology adoption, skills, and quality systems.\n\nIndia’s industrial journey could be more fruitful if it aligns to the new geopolitical changes, supply-chain realignments, reworked trade agreements between nations and a more protectionist and fragmented global order.\n\nThis time around, the survey has gone a step further from being an annual narrative of economic health and the outlook ahead to a 799-page report that enlists how the government and industry should walk the talk.\n\nOf course, there’s no brushing aside the persistent weakness in the Indian rupee amid the domestic macroeconomic buoyancy. At present, in spite of dollar weakness, the INR is flirting with the 92 mark to the USD. My colleagueManas Chakravarty explains the reasons.\n\nThe biggest comfort in FY26 came from benign inflation that looks “anchored and tamed”. How long will this trend last?Read here.\n\nIndeed, a Survey document this long may have taken hours of burning the midnight oil to collate but will take even longer for investors to digest and extrapolate into investment decisions. Little wonder then that Indian equities surged initially to record daily highs before settling lower, just a tad above the previous day’s closing.

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey 2026 has called for the active use of “economic statecraft”, urging the government to strategically deploy economic tools to advance India’s foreign policy, national security and long-term strategic interests.\n\nThe emphasis comes as India remains among the world’s fastest-growing major economies for the fourth consecutive year.\n\nWhile underlining the relevance of economic statecraft in today’s geopolitical environment, the survey notes that the concept itself is far from new.\n\nIt specifically cites Chanakya, also known as Kautilya, and his seminal work Arthashastra as one of the earliest and most systematic treatises on statecraft, integrating economic governance with political and strategic imperatives.\n\nAccording to the survey, Arthashastra demonstrates how economic instruments such as trade regulation, taxation, resource management and state control were historically used to strengthen state power and achieve strategic objectives.\n\nBy invoking Chanakya, the survey places India’s modern economic strategy within a long civilisational tradition of linking economic policy to national security and diplomacy.\n\nThe survey also refers to historical examples beyond India, including the Megarian Decree imposed by ancient Athens and the Roman Empire’s grain provisioning system, Cura Annonae, as instances where economic measures were used to achieve strategic and political ends.\n\nExplaining the concept, the survey defines economic statecraft as the deliberate use of economic means to achieve strategic outcomes. Unlike conventional economic policy, which focuses on goals such as controlling inflation, managing deficits and promoting growth, economic statecraft goes further by using economic tools to influence the behaviour of other states, protect national security, or reshape geopolitical outcomes.\n\nIn the modern context, the survey notes that economic interdependence, once seen as a stabilising force, is increasingly viewed as a source of vulnerability. Pandemic-related disruptions, the weaponisation of energy and finance during global conflicts, and the growing use of export controls in advanced technologies have exposed the limits of efficiency-driven globalisation.\n\nAs a result, both advanced and emerging economies are reassessing their dependence on concentrated supply chains, critical raw materials and key technologies, often framing these shifts through the lens of national security. The Economic Survey argues that India must consciously use economic statecraft, rooted in both historical wisdom and contemporary realities, to navigate an increasingly contested global order.",

Between April-August FY26, Indian companies made investments worth $10.2 billion ,compared to $7.9 billion in the corresponding period last year.\n\n“The persistence of outflows despite global financial uncertainties underscores ongoing internationalisation by Indian enterprises,” CEA V Ananth Nageswaran said.\n\nThe survey states that between April 2023-August 2025, nearly 82 percent of cumulative ODI (Overseas Direct Investment) of $48.3 billion was directed to the top ten destination countries of Singapore (27 percent), the United States (16 percent), UAE (10 percent), Mauritius (9 percent) and the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (7 per centeach), reflecting both strategic-asset seeking in advanced markets and the use of international financial hubs.\n\nThe survey also pointed out that despite tighter financing conditions and heightened geopolitical uncertainty, FDI inflows to developing economies remained broadly stable at $867 billion (57 percent of global FDI) in CY 2024.

        "full_content": "The insurance sector has grown at a robust pace but costs, too, have increased steadily, with a significant portion of premiums being consumed by distribution overheads, the Economic Survey 2025–26, released on January 29, has said.\n\nWhile the total premium income scaled up sharply in FY25, growing to Rs 11.9 lakh crore from Rs 8.3 lakh crore in FY21, the survey said despite the push for digital transformation, customer acquisition continues to depend heavily on expensive intermediary networks instead of technology leading to cost rationalisation.\n\nThe central argument in the survey is that both life and non-life insurance segments are not taking advantage of digitisation to support both acquisition costs and restore ‘value for money’ to the policyholder.\n\nStructural challenges: high operating cost\n\nBeyond the industry’s success in deepening revenue from existing customers, the survey flagged a decline in insurance penetration to 3.7 percent. High distribution costs are preventing a widening of the risk pool. It is essential to lower overall costs and distribution outgoes to improve affordability to tap into the \"missing middle\" and reverse the decline in penetration.\n\nAccording to the survey, this structural constraint helps to understand why the escalating cost blocks the insurance sector’s evolution, creating distortions that limit inclusion, erode consumer value, and threaten long-term stability. The survey acknowledges that the cost of acquisition is not merely an operational friction.\n\nThe survey also draws a sharp distinction between private life insurers and the non-life sector's high-cost model strategies, posing a risk to the core financial strength of insurers.\n\nThe insurance sector has matured into one of the economy's deepest institutional pools of long-term capital but remains constrained by a \"low-penetration, high-cost\" equilibrium driven by a high-cost distribution model, it said.\n\n“Even after years of digital investment, most policies are still sold through high-commission agents and intermediaries, which makes insurance more expensive for customers. That’s why we see a strange trend— people who already buy insurance are spending more, but overall coverage is not expanding much,” said Alay Razvi, Managing Partner, Accord Juris.\n\nThe survey said insurers are not taking advantage of the digitisation of distribution to support both acquisition costs and restore ‘value for money’ to the policyholder.\n\n“As a result, a significant portion of insurance premiums is consumed by distribution overheads rather than being channelled towards risk coverage, product innovation, or improved claims servicing,” said Atul Menon, Partner, King Stubb & Kasiva, Advocates and Attorneys.",

        "full_content": "If you invest in equities for long enough, one thing becomes clear very quickly: no single segment leads the market every year. Large caps do well in some phases, mid caps shine in others, and small caps can swing from stellar to painful within short periods.\n\nThat’s why many investors prefer funds that give exposure across market capitalisations instead of betting on just one segment. Flexi-cap and multi-cap funds are designed for exactly this purpose. On the surface, they sound similar. In practice, they behave very differently.\n\nWhy diversification across market caps matters\n\nRecent years are a good reminder of why diversification helps. In 2025, large-cap stocks delivered steady returns, mid caps were more muted, and small caps struggled. In other years, the order has been completely reversed.\n\nSince it’s almost impossible to consistently predict which segment will outperform next, spreading exposure helps smooth the journey and improves the odds of sensible long-term returns.\n\nBoth flexi-cap and multi-cap funds aim to do this, but they take different routes.\n\nWhat a flexi-cap fund really does\n\nA flexi-cap fund invests across large-, mid- and small-cap stocks, but without any compulsory allocation to each category. As long as at least 65 percent of the portfolio is in equities, the fund manager is free to decide where the money goes.\n\nThis flexibility is the key feature.\n\nIf the fund manager believes large caps are safer or better valued, the portfolio can tilt heavily in that direction. If mid and small caps look attractive, exposure can be increased there instead. The allocation can change meaningfully over time as market conditions and valuations shift.\n\nIn other words, with a flexi-cap fund, you are trusting the fund manager to actively move money between market-cap segments.\n\nHow multi-cap funds work differently\n\nMulti-cap funds follow stricter rules. They must invest at least 75 percent of their assets in equities, with a minimum of 25 percent each in large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap stocks at all times. The remaining 25 percent is flexible.\n\nThis structure ensures constant exposure to all three segments, regardless of market conditions. Even if small caps are expensive or volatile, the fund still needs to maintain that minimum allocation.\n\nThe upside is balance. The downside is limited flexibility.\n\nWhy this difference matters in real life\n\nIn a flexi-cap fund, the fund manager can actively reduce exposure to overheated segments and move to safer or better-valued areas. This can help manage risk during frothy phases, but it also means returns depend heavily on the manager’s judgement.\n\nIn a multi-cap fund, allocation discipline is built in. You always stay diversified, but the fund cannot fully step away from a struggling segment even if valuations look stretched or risks are rising.\n\nThis is why multi-cap funds can feel more volatile during sharp small-cap corrections, while flexi-cap funds may appear relatively calmer in the same phase.\n\nWhat the return numbers tell you — and what they don’t\n\nCategory-level data shows that multi-cap funds have delivered stronger returns than flexi-cap funds over some longer periods. But this doesn’t mean multi-cap funds are always better.\n\nIndividual fund performance varies widely. A well-managed flexi-cap fund can outperform many multi-cap funds, and vice versa. What matters more is whether the fund’s structure matches your comfort with risk and your expectations from the fund manager.\n\nPast returns are useful for context, not decision-making on their own.\n\nBoth flexi-cap and multi-cap funds are equity-heavy and suit investors with a long-term horizon, ideally five years or more.\n\nA flexi-cap fund may suit you if you are comfortable letting the fund manager make allocation calls and are okay with the portfolio looking very different from year to year. This works better for investors who trust active decision-making and can live with periods of underperformance.\n\nA multi-cap fund may suit you if you want built-in diversification across market caps at all times and prefer a more rule-based structure. You accept that the fund will always have exposure to all segments, even during tough phases.\n\nFlexi-cap and multi-cap funds are not competing products so much as different philosophies.\n\nOne relies on flexibility and fund manager judgement. The other relies on discipline and balance. Neither is inherently superior. The right choice depends on how much control you want the fund manager to have, how comfortable you are with volatility, and how patiently you can stay invested through market cycles.\n\nIf you understand what each fund is designed to do, choosing between them becomes much simpler.",

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey 2026 indicates a major shift in India's household financial savings over the past decade, reflecting a fundamental change in how additional financial resources are allocated.\n\nThe transition is characterised by a steady shift towards market-linked instruments, especially equities, reflecting both structural changes in the financial system and changing household risk preferences, the survey, tabled in Parliament on January 29, has said.\n\nThe evolving equity orientation is also evident in the flow of household financial savings. Between FY12 and FY25, gross financial savings increased substantially, accompanied by a notable reallocation across instruments.\n\n\"The share of equity and mutual funds in annual household financial savings increased from around 2 percent in FY12 to over 15.2 per cent in FY25. This shift has coincided with a steady rise in SIP contributions, with average monthly SIP flows increasing seven times from under Rs 4,000 crore in FY17 to over Rs 28,000 crore in FY26 (April-November),\" it said.\n\nEquity investments, once secondary to household balance sheets, are now a major part of financial wealth, supported by broader participation and more diverse access channels. The growth of debt-linked instrument markets is a logical next step toward achieving balanced, diversified portfolios and meeting long-term financial objectives.\n\nThe growing prevalence of systematic investments reflects a shift towards long-term and sustained household engagement with savings being channelled in a disciplined manner across market cycles. In contrast, the share of term deposits declined from over 58 percent in FY12 to around 35 percent in FY25, after having fallen to as low as 31.9 per cent in FY22, the survey said.\n\nThis pattern indicates portfolio diversification rather than displacement, with households adding equity exposure to their existing savings instead of completely substituting away from traditional instruments.\n\nA notable aspect of the move to equities is the growing proportion of individuals in total equity market ownership, accomplished through both direct and indirect means.\n\n“The share of individual investors increased from around 11 percent in FY14 to 14.3 percent in FY19, and further to 18.8 per cent by September 2025. In absolute terms, individual equity holdings expanded to around Rs 84 lakh crore by September 2025, from just Rs 8 lakh crore in FY14,” it said.\n\nWhile the direct participation of individuals in equity markets grew slowly, rising from just under 8 percent in FY14 to around 9.6 percent by September 2025, the indirect share nearly tripled, reaching 9.2 percent during the same period. From April 2020 to September 2025, household equity wealth is estimated to have grown by about Rs 53 lakh crore. This highlights how ongoing engagement in the markets has been crucial for long-term wealth building.",

        "full_content": "The next phase of India’s industrial growth will depend less on protection and more on scale, technology adoption, innovation and deeper integration into global value chains, the Economic Survey 2025-26, tabled in Parliament on January  29, has said.\n\nThe survey pegs manufacturing as central to India’s long-term growth ambitions, as global supply chains undergo structural realignments. Competitiveness is increasingly determined not by low-cost labour alone but by technological capability, reliability and strategic relevance within global production networks, it said.\n\nFor India to emerge as a high-productivity manufacturing hub, the survey emphasised the need for stable, innovation-friendly policies and sustained reforms across ease of doing business, R&D and innovation, skilling, infrastructure and logistics, and MSME scaling.\n\nA key recommendation is to move toward mission-driven manufacturing policy through the National Manufacturing Mission. The survey positioned the mission as the long-term blueprint to expand manufacturing capacity, accelerate technology adoption and deepen MSME integration into domestic and global supply chains.\n\nThe long-term vision is ambitious, targeting a doubling of manufacturing’s share in GDP to 25 percent by 2035, generating around 143 million jobs and pushing merchandise exports toward $1.2 trillion.\n\nThe survey also recommended continuing targeted incentive-based industrial policy in strategic sectors through schemes such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) programme.\n\nPLI schemes, now spanning 14 sectors with an outlay of Rs 1.97 lakh crore, have already helped attract more than Rs 2 lakh crore in investments, generate incremental production of over Rs 18.7 lakh crore and support employment generation of more than 12.6 lakh, it said.\n\nThe policy signal is that targeted, scale-linked incentives can help anchor global supply chains in India when combined with domestic capability building.\n\nBeyond incentives, the survey favoured innovation-led manufacturing. It stressed the need for India to transition from a technology adopter to a global innovator, supported by initiatives such as the Anusandhan National Research Foundation and research and innovation funding mechanisms aimed at crowding in private R&D investment and accelerating capability development in strategic sectors.\n\nThe survey also linked manufacturing competitiveness directly to infrastructure and logistics efficiency. Initiatives such as PM GatiShakti and the National Industrial Corridor Development Programme are critical to reducing logistics costs, improving supply chain reliability and enabling large-scale industrial growth. Infrastructure is positioned not just as a growth enabler but as a core determinant of manufacturing competitiveness.\n\nAnother recommendation is to accelerate MSME integration into larger value chains. Long-term manufacturing growth and job creation will depend on the ability of smaller firms to scale, adopt technology and participate in global supply networks rather than remain fragmented and domestically focused, it said.",

        "full_content": "The current state of private investment and signals about its likely trajectory make up an important strand of the Survey. In this context, it identifies the cost of capital as an important influence on the level and growth of private investment.\n\nOver a 30-year period (1995 to 2025), the weighted average interest rate in India averaged 7.61%. It was much higher than Switzerland’s 1.04% but far lower than that of another emerging market, Indonesia, where the rate was 14.1%.\n\nLink between CAD and interest rates\n\nThe Survey unpacks the factors that influence the level of interest rates and concludes that the most important structural explanation for India’s relatively high cost of capital is linked to the overall savings position. This, in turn, has its roots in a persistent current account deficit (CAD). Consequently, there’s a risk premium which is priced into interest rates as well as equity returns.\n\nThe point here is that India’s persistent CAD is undermining industrial competitiveness and acting as a drag on investment. Find a way to get rid of this deficit on the external front and an important drag on investment goes away.\n\nIndia doesn’t do too badly when it comes to CAD, particularly when seen in a global context. At a little over 1% of GDP, India’s current CAD level puts it in the same category as Australia or UK.\n\nThe primary reason for it is that the services exports have been the foundation on which the Balance of Payments has coped with multiple shocks over the last six years.\n\nIn FY25, services exports hit a record of $387.5 billion and the trade surplus in this segment was $188.8 billion.  It is this surplus which offset about two-third of the merchandise trade deficit. Take away services exports from the equation, the situation would have been precarious.\n\nYet, services exports are treated with a lens that may have been relevant in another era but is inconsistent with evidence across the world.\n\nAccording to Survey, services are not a substitute for a goods-based export ecosystem that underpins resilient currency and external stability.\n\nWhy? Services exports do not compel broad upgrades in state capacity, argues the Survey.\n\nWhat global evidence teaches us\n\nEven within India, the pressure on state governments, Karnataka being the prime example, to upgrade their ability to cope with urban demands suggests otherwise.\n\nThat said, there’s a more important reason why the Survey and, by extension, the general policy approach underestimates the importance of what services can do for the Indian economy.\n\nThe World Bank in 2021 took a look at the changing nature of global development in a report titled‘At Your Service? The Promise of Services-Led Development’.\n\nAmongst its key findings were that the line of demarcation between services and manufacturing was increasingly hazy. A classic example of manufacturing prowess such as the automobile industry is no longer free of services inputs.\n\nFor example, the World Bank report said that software-related services contributed 40% of the value of a 2010 GM Chevy Volt model. If anything, the contribution of the services industry in automobiles will only represent a much larger value in future.\n\nEven in the case of China, the global manufacturing powerhouse, data tells us a counterintuitive story. The number of jobs and wages supported by the export of business services exceeds that of manufactured goods in China. That is the case in India too.\n\nOne legitimate complaint about services is that is not a monolith. A lot of services in India are characterized by limited value addition and low wages. Even that is not a good enough for policy making to underestimate the contribution of services.\n\nData from the World Bank report shows that labour productivity in informal services has been consistently higher than agriculture since 1990.\n\nNone of these facts support a case for ignoring manufacturing when it comes to policy and resource allocation. But these facts do make a case that India’s’ on to a good thing when it comes to services. Therefore, it’s unwise to underrate its potential and, thereby, pay inadequate attention to what makes it work.\n\nThat’s precisely what the debate about Bengaluru’s urban woe is.",

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey 2025–26 has suggested that the government could consider amending the definition of a “government company” under the Companies Act to enable greater equity monetisation from central public sector enterprises (CPSEs), while retaining effective control through special resolution rights.\n\nThe Survey pointed out that current legal constraints are limiting further disinvestment in a significant share of listed CPSEs. “Currently, in about 30 per cent of listed CPSEs, Government shareholding is already below 60 per cent, limiting further disinvestment through OFS, as it is stipulated in the Companies Act that a ‘government company’ must have at least 51 per cent of its stake held by the central or state government,” it said.\n\n“Going forward, receipts from equity monetisation can be strengthened by selectively reducing Government equity in certain CPSEs beyond the minimum public shareholding norms,” the Survey said, adding that such decisions should be “guided by market conditions and enterprise-specific factors”.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey in Parliament on January 29.\n\nThe Survey noted that effective control does not require majority ownership. “Since effective control requires only about a 26 per cent stake, the Government could consider amending the definition of ‘Government Company’ under the Companies Act, limited to listed entities, to allow them to remain as government companies with a minimum of 26 per cent ownership,” it said.\n\nSuch a change, the Survey said, would allow the government to “retain special resolution rights, while enabling the government to monetise its stake”. This approach, it added, could unlock additional equity monetisation without diluting strategic control over key enterprises.\n\nAlternative route: phased exit without legal change\n\nThe Survey also outlined an alternative path if the government’s objective is eventual privatisation. “Alternatively, if the objective is eventual privatisation, the Government could continue phased OFS below 51 per cent and even towards full exit, without changing the legal definition of ‘government company’,” it said.\n\nThis approach would enable CPSEs to operate after disinvestment “as professionally managed entities with dispersed ownership, clear governance standards, and transparent succession frameworks,” the Survey noted.\n\nRecycling disinvestment proceeds\n\nThe Survey further suggested that disinvestment receipts could be channelled towards future-oriented investments. “A portion of disinvestment receipts could also be earmarked for strategic investments in emerging technology and innovation-driven companies through professionally managed platforms such as the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), thereby recycling public capital toward future growth sectors,” it said.\n\n“This will also ensure a steady stream of disinvestment receipts into the future,” the Survey added.\n\nStrategic disinvestment progress\n\nAccording to the Survey, strategic disinvestment has proceeded in a calibrated manner in recent years. “Since 2016, in-principle approval has been accorded for strategic disinvestment for 36 CPSEs, of which 13 transactions have been completed, with the remainder at various stages of implementation,” it said.\n\nDuring FY26, the government also moved ahead with stake dilution and exits from select joint ventures. “During FY26, approvals were also accorded for stake dilution or exit from select joint ventures, including NTPC’s divestment from Utility Powertech Limited,” the Survey said.\n\nThese steps, it added, were supported by broader governance reforms. “These actions were complemented by governance reforms that empowered CPSE Boards to undertake the closure, merger, or disinvestment of subsidiaries,” the Survey said.\n\nTaken together, the Survey’s assessment suggests that a combination of legal flexibility, calibrated disinvestment and governance reforms could expand equity monetisation options for the government, while strengthening CPSE governance and redeploying public capital towards emerging growth areas.",

In many instances, spending failed to translate into durable asset creation or productivity gains, while leakages and poor monitoring diluted the programme’s effectiveness as a safety net.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the government has enacted the Viksit Bharat–Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act, 2025, or the VB G-RAM G Act, 2025, marking a statutory overhaul of rural employment policy.\n\nAccording to the Survey, the new framework seeks to align rural employment with the government’s long-term vision of Viksit Bharat 2047, while tightening accountability and focusing more sharply on infrastructure outcomes and income security.\n\nThe VB G-RAM G Act, the Survey said, represents a decisive shift in approach, addressing operational shortcomings of MGNREGS through a more modern, accountable and outcome-oriented framework.",

        "full_content": "India’s electric vehicle (EV) segment has witnessed rapid expansion over the past six years, recording a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 63 percent, according to the Economic Survey 2025–26 tabled by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on January 29.\n\nTotal EV registrations in the country rose to 1.97 million units in FY25, up from 1.68 million units in FY24, reflecting a year-on-year growth of 16.9 percent. In FY20 the total EV registrations in the country stood at around 0.1-0.2 million.\n\nElectric passenger vehicle registrations crossed the 100,000 mark for the first time in FY25, registering an 18 percent increase compared to the previous year.\n\nElectric two-wheelers continued to dominate the segment, with registrations growing by 21 percent in FY25 to reach 1.15 million units, underlining their role as the primary driver of EV adoption in India.\n\nThe strong growth trajectory has been supported by multiple policy interventions launched by the Centre to promote electric mobility. One of the key initiatives is the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for the Automobile and Auto Components Industry, approved in September 2021 with an outlay of Rs 25,938 crore. The scheme, which incentivises high-value advanced automotive technology vehicles and components, has attracted cumulative investments worth Rs 35,657 crore till September 2025.\n\nAnother major pillar is the PLI scheme for the National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage, with an outlay of Rs 18,100 crore for 50 GWh capacity. Under the scheme, 40 GWh of capacity has already been awarded, helping localise battery manufacturing and strengthen the domestic EV ecosystem.\n\nIn September 2024, the government also launched the PM E-Drive scheme with an outlay of Rs 10,900 crore. The programme provides demand incentives for electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers, while extending support to new segments such as e-trucks and e-ambulances. It also includes funding for charging infrastructure and upgrades of vehicle testing agencies.\n\nFurther boosting public transport electrification, the Centre notified the PM e-Bus Sewa–Payment Security Mechanism (PSM) scheme in October 2024, with an estimated outlay of Rs 3,435.33 crore. The scheme aims to support the deployment of over 38,000 electric buses by providing payment security to operators and OEMs in case of defaults by public transport authorities.\n\nThe Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) had previously said that government policy interventions, combined with a growing number of EV launches by manufacturers, have provided strong momentum for the adoption of electric vehicles across the country.",

        "full_content": "The government rolled out Phase II of its Compliance Reduction and Deregulation initiative in January 2026, expanding the scope of reforms across key sectors such as land, building and construction, labour, environment, education, health, utilities and overarching regulatory frameworks, the Economic Survey 2025–26 said.\n\nThe Survey said the initiative reflects a broader reorientation of governance towards strengthening state capacity through the disciplined removal of regulatory frictions. “The Economic Survey brings together these three elements – state capacity, the society, and deregulation – in the pursuit of Viksit Bharat and global influence. A strong and stable currency would be a natural corollary of that,” it said.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the survey in Parliament on January 29.\n\nPhase I outcomes encouraging, Phase II broadens scope\n\nAccording to the Survey, outcomes from the first phase of deregulation have been encouraging. “The experience of Phase I illustrates a broader lesson of this chapter: that state capacity is built not only through new institutions or additional controls, but through disciplined removal of frictions that impede productive activity,” it said.\n\nBuilding on this experience, “Phase II of the Compliance Reduction and Deregulation initiative was rolled out in January 2026 to cover additional priority areas, including land, building and construction, utilities and permissions, environment, education, health, labour, and overarching reforms,” the Survey noted.\n\n“The current phase of deregulation demonstrates how disciplined removal of friction can strengthen state capacity at scale,” it added.\n\nDeregulation as institutional reorientation\n\n“Deregulation, when pursued as a continuous and coordinated governance process, is not a retreat of the State but a strengthening of it,” it said.\n\nBy “simplifying rules, clarifying responsibilities, and making processes predictable and time-bound, administrative effort is shifted away from low-value policing toward problem-solving, monitoring, and execution,” the Survey said, adding that deregulation thus becomes “not only a pro-business reform, but a mechanism for building state capacity itself”.\n\nThe chapter also examined the compliance reduction initiative as a practical demonstration of institutional capability. “Deregulation is treated not as regulatory withdrawal, but as institutional reorientation, shifting administrative effort from low-value policing toward coordination, facilitation, and problem-solving,” it said.\n\nTask Force driving coordinated reform\n\nThe Survey detailed the role of the Task Force on Compliance Reduction and Deregulation, constituted in January 2025 under the chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary T.V. Somanathan. The Task Force was set up “to drive reforms that simplify regulations and streamline procedures across States and Union Territories”.\n\nIts objectives include identifying “redundant, overlapping, or outdated compliances”, guiding States in amending laws and procedures, encouraging standardised reform templates, facilitating risk-based compliance frameworks, promoting digitisation of government-to-business services through a countrywide Single Window System, and documenting best practices for replication.\n\n“What distinguishes this exercise from earlier deregulation drives is not only the number of reforms, but the institutional process: cross-agency coordination, iterative problem-solving with States, and real-time learning,” the Survey said.\n\nPriority areas and state-level momentum\n\nThe Task Force identified 23 Priority Areas across five broad sectors – Land Use, Building and Construction, Labour, Utilities and Permissions, and Overarching Priorities – covering a large share of regulatory interactions between enterprises and the State.\n\nBeyond common templates, “several States and Union Territories have undertaken innovative reforms that go beyond the common reform templates, tailored to their specific administrative, economic, and spatial contexts,” the Survey said. This, it added, demonstrates how deregulation is being internalised as “a continuous governance process rather than a checklist exercise”.\n\nThe Survey linked deregulation with broader economic outcomes. “Sustained state-level deregulation efforts are enabling small and medium enterprises to expand and integrate more effectively into formal value chains, elevating the economy’s medium-term growth potential,” it said.\n\nIndia has also recorded “significant employment growth in recent years, supported by structural reforms, tax rationalisation, and a sustained focus on skill development”. Measures such as deregulation, Goods and Services Tax reforms and labour reforms implemented by states have contributed to rising labour force participation and employment growth across industry and services.\n\nThe Survey noted that FY26 was marked by heightened external uncertainty, including penal tariffs affecting exporters. “The government responded by using this crisis as an opportunity to push through key measures such as GST rationalisation, faster progress on deregulation, and further simplification of compliance requirements across sectors,” it said.\n\nLooking ahead, the Survey said predictable and stable regulatory frameworks would be critical for reviving private capital expenditure. “Reviving private capital expenditure in such areas requires buffering sector-specific uncertainty by enhancing predictability through deregulation and simpler, more stable laws and frameworks,” it said.",

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey 2025-26 has proposed a national input cost reduction strategy, saying lowering the cost of energy, logistics, raw materials, compliance and others is as critical to industrial growth as building physical infrastructure.\n\nThe survey framed input costs as a form of “competitiveness infrastructure”, suggesting that elevated costs across supply chains act like a hidden tax on manufacturing, exports and job creation. It argued that for India to emerge as a globally competitive manufacturing hub, competitiveness must be both achievable and affordable across sectors, not limited to a few protected industries.\n\nIt cautioned that traditional industrial strategies centred on protecting final goods can backfire if input costs remain high. According to the survey, protecting downstream products while leaving raw material, energy and logistics costs elevated makes it harder for firms to scale production or compete internationally. Affordable and reliable inputs, it notes, are foundational to sustaining industrial growth and export competitiveness.\n\nThe survey flagged tariff inversion as a key risk. When duties on intermediate goods exceed those on finished products, domestic producers face higher costs than importers of finished goods, it said. This can encourage assembly-led imports instead of deeper domestic value addition, weakening manufacturing depth and reducing incentives for private investment. Correcting such distortions, the survey said, is a structural reform with economy-wide implications rather than a marginal trade policy adjustment.\n\nThe survey emphasised that input cost reform should be rule-based and economy-wide rather than sector-specific. Inputs widely used across industries should not be treated as revenue sources or protection instruments once domestic capacity is established. Protecting such inputs may benefit a narrow set of producers but raises costs for downstream sectors, weakening export competitiveness and job creation.\n\nThe survey also linked input costs directly to private investment behaviour. Thin margins in export-oriented manufacturing, high sensitivity among MSMEs and limited incentives to invest in technology upgrades make input costs a binding constraint on industrial expansion. In this context, lowering input costs can simultaneously strengthen multiple value chains and improve overall industrial productivity.\n\nBy treating input cost efficiency as a core policy priority, alongside infrastructure, logistics and regulatory simplification, the survey signals a shift toward a horizontal industrial strategy aimed at strengthening India’s position in global manufacturing and export markets.",

        "full_content": "Global financial markets were unsettled in the first half of calendar year (CY) 2025 following the US government's announcement of a series of tariff measures. The move triggered a sharp rise in global policy uncertainty, prompting investors to cut exposure to the US dollar and rotate towards traditional safe-haven assets, most notably gold.\n\nAccording to the Economic Survey 2026, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on January 29, global equity markets weakened and risk premiums widened across asset classes in April 2025. The spike in uncertainty led to heightened volatility across financial markets. However, conditions stabilised in the months that followed, as some of the US government’s policy announcements were rolled back and market volatility gradually returned to normal levels.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, gold emerged as a clear outperformer. Prices surged from $2,607 per ounce to $4,315 per ounce during 2025, supported by a weakening US dollar, expectations of persistently negative real interest rates, and growing investor concerns around geopolitical and financial tail risks, per the economic survey.\n\nBy contrast, global equities, represented by the MSCI World index (premier stock market index), delivered modest gains. After an early March dip, equities recovered and trended higher, but at a slower pace than gold. The gap between gold and global equities widened notably after September, suggesting investors increasingly favoured defensive assets over growth-linked ones.\n\nEmerging-market equities lagged even further, posting only gradual gains throughout the year.\n\nCorporate bond markets tell a third part of the story. US and euro high-yield spreads spiked sharply around April, signalling stress and risk aversion. However, spreads narrowed steadily afterwards, indicating improving credit conditions and stabilising investor confidence. Even so, this improvement in bonds did not translate into stronger equity performance.\n\nThe economic survey stated, \"Financial markets are typically the first to register and absorb the impact of an uncertainty shock. Much before agents across government, trade, and households adjust their choices, financial market participants tend to respond by pricing in uncertainty risk in real time. The year 2025 was marked by heightened uncertainty, which had a palpable impact on financial markets.\"\n\nThe survey also revealed that the impact of uncertainty on financial markets extends beyond just increased volatility and risk premiums. Research indicates that extended periods of uncertainty can influence the financial sector through at least three main channels. First, financial market participants tend to delay decisions when faced with uncertainty. Second, increased uncertainty can raise borrowing costs by widening credit spreads and financial intermediation expenses. Third, sustained uncertainty may lead to more significant market corrections across various asset classes.",

It added that universities should have the freedom to curate and offer courses based on industry requirements and students’ aptitudes.\n\n“Flexibility is the key to building capable talent in India,” the survey said, pointing to the Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhishthan Bill, 2025 as a foundational reform. It said the proposed legislation represents “an essential first step” in giving higher education institutions the autonomy to adapt their curricula in line with rapidly evolving technology trends.\n\n“As the floor for what is considered a fundamental skill shifts with every technological revolution, the passage of the bill will afford our higher education system the freedom to keep pace with the evolving world,” the survey said.\n\nThe document also called for a rethink of how policymakers define formal education and work experience. “Now is the time for policies to reevaluate what constitutes ‘formal education’ and what constitutes ‘work experience’,” it said, noting that the traditional separation between classrooms and industry exposure may no longer work in an AI-driven economy.\n\nIndia already has enabling frameworks in place to support such changes, the survey said.\n\n“With the National Education Policy 2020’s Multiple Entry Multiple Exit provisions, the Academic Bank of Credits, and the National Credit Framework, India has the policy infrastructure in place to make this vision real,” it added.",

        "full_content": "India’s gig workforce stands at 77 lakh workers, accounting for just over 2 percent of total employment, underscoring both the growing role and the still limited scale of platform-led work in the country’s labour market, according to the Economic Survey 2025–26.\n\nThe Survey notes that gig employment has expanded rapidly over the past few years alongside the growth of digital platforms, smartphone penetration and digital payments, while highlighting persistent challenges related to income stability, access to credit and social security coverage.\n\nData cited in the Survey shows that the gig workforce increased from around 77 lakh workers in FY21 to about 1.2 crore by FY25, a rise of nearly 55 percent in four years. Despite this growth, the sector continues to represent a small share of overall employment, reflecting the dominance of traditional jobs across agriculture, manufacturing and services.\n\nLooking ahead, the Survey estimates that non-agricultural gig work could account for 6.7 percent of India’s workforce by 2029–30, contributing as much as Rs 2.35 lakh crore to GDP, as platform-based work expands across delivery, logistics, transportation, IT services and other segments.\n\nSector-wise data shows that gig employment is concentrated in e-commerce and logistics, which together account for 52 lakh workers, with 37 lakh in e-commerce and 15 lakh in logistics. BFSI and manufacturing employ 10 lakh gig workers each, followed by retail at 7 lakh. Transportation and IT account for 6 lakh and 5 lakh workers, respectively.\n\nSmaller segments include healthcare, IT-enabled services, construction and education, with around 3 lakh workers each. Sectors such as automotive (1 lakh), hospitality (0.8 lakh), infrastructure (0.7 lakh), telecom (0.5 lakh) and power and energy (0.3 lakh) together form a relatively limited share of the overall gig workforce.\n\nThe Survey notes that demand for gig labour varies significantly by task type and skill level, ranging from high-turnover delivery and retail roles to specialised professionals such as programmers, physicians and legal consultants working across multiple clients.\n\nDespite the sector's expansion, the Survey flags income volatility as a key concern. Around 40 percent of gig workers earn less than Rs 15,000 per month, reflecting uneven demand, variable payouts and the absence of assured wages.\n\nIrregular earnings and limited employment histories have also resulted in restricted access to formal credit, with many gig workers falling into the “thin-file” category. Limited access to finance constrains their ability to invest in productive assets such as vehicles or specialised equipment, making it difficult to move into higher-paying gigs.\n\nAlgorithms and worker vulnerability\n\nThe Survey highlights the growing role of platform algorithms in determining work allocation, performance monitoring, wages and supply-demand matching. While these systems enable operational efficiency and scale, they also raise concerns around transparency, algorithmic bias and burnout.\n\nIt also notes that limited skilling and concerns over job losses linked to technological advances such as artificial intelligence and machine learning add to worker vulnerability, particularly in low-skilled gig roles.\n\nOn regulation, the Survey reiterates that gig and platform workers have been formally recognised under the Code on Social Security, while remaining outside traditional employer–employee relationships. It highlights the need to expand access to social security measures such as provident fund, insurance and maternity benefits through welfare frameworks and benefit portability.\n\nWhile referencing global regulatory developments such as the European Union’s Platform Workers’ Directive and Spain’s rider law, the Survey does not indicate any move towards employee reclassification in India.\n\nThe Survey states that policy efforts should focus on improving access to skilling, credit and productive assets, with the objective of enabling upward mobility and ensuring that gig work does not remain a low-income necessity. As the gig economy expands further, addressing income insecurity and strengthening worker protections will be key to sustaining its contribution to employment and economic growth.",

        "full_content": "The shares of Coal India and Bharat Coking Coal sharply gained in trade on January 29 after the government designated coking coal as a 'Critical and Strategic Mineral' under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.\n\nThe newly-listed shares ofBharat Coking Coal(BCCL) jumped nearly 5 percent to Rs 39 apiece in the afternoon trading hours of Thursday.Coal Indiashares meanwhile gained around 3 percent to Rs 456.95 apiece.\n\nGovt designates coking coal as critical mineral:\n\nThe Ministry of Coal is a press statement said that the decision was taken on the basis of the recommendations of the High-Level Committee on Implementation of Viksit Bharat Goals (HLC-VB) and policy inputs from NITI Aayog, recognising the “strategic role of coking coal in ensuring mineral security and meeting the requirements of the domestic steel sector”.\n\nThe ministry noted that India has approximately 37.37 billion tonnes of coking coal resources, largely located in Jharkhand, with additional reserves in Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh. “Despite this domestic availability, imports of coking coal have increased from 51.20 million tonnes in 2020–21 to 57.58 million tonnes in 2024–25. Currently, around 95 %  of the coking coal requirement of the steel sector is met through imports, leading to significant foreign exchange outgo,” it added.\n\nThe inclusion of coking coal in the category will likely facilitate faster approvals, improve ease of doing business and accelerate exploration and mining activities, including of deep-seated deposits, the government said. “Mining of critical minerals is exempt from public consultation requirements and permits the utilisation of degraded forest land for compensatory afforestation, measures that are also expected to encourage greater private sector participation,” it added.\n\nThe amendment is expected to reduce India’s import dependence, strengthen supply-chain resilience for the steel sector, and support the objectives of the National Steel Policy, according to the ministry.\n\nWhat the Economic Survey said about coal:\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey in the Parliament earlier today. According to the survey, coal “remains crucial” as India has the fifth-largest coal reserves and is the second-largest consumer. Coal contributes 55 percent to the national energy mix and fuels over 74 percent of total power generation, it added.\n\nThe survey noted that India’s coal industry reached historic heights in FY25, producing 1,047.52 million tonnes (MT) of coal. This marked a 4.98 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase from the Rs 997.83 MT. “This represents the highest coal production the country has ever achieved, demonstrating the industry's impressive growth and importance to India's energy needs,” it added.\n\n“Driven by this strong domestic output, imports registered a significant 7.9 per cent decline, falling from 264.53 MT in FY24 to 243.62 MT in FY25.15 Furthermore, the ratio of domestic production to consumption has also steadily improved over the past decade, as production growth has consistently outpaced consumption growth,” the Economic Survey further said.\n\nAdditionally, the survey noted that India’s steel industry faces critical dependence on imported Coking Coal. “To mitigate global supply risks, the Ministry of Coal launched Mission Coking Coal in 2022 with a view to significantly enhance domestic raw coking coal production to 140 MT by 2030,” it said.\n\nCoal India shares hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 456.95 apiece today. The stock has gained around 8 percent in one week, and 14 percent in one month.\n\nBharat Coking Coal shares made a stellar stock market debut on the exchanges earlier this month, listing with a premium of nearly 96 percent, following a massive subscription of 147 times between January 9-13 in the primary market.\n\nShares of Bharat Coking Coal Ltd were listed at Rs 45 per share on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). The stock has so far declined around 13 percent since listing.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

Nearly half of the issuances (about 47 per cent of total issuances) were concentrated in bonds maturing beyond 10 years. This provided the necessary support for managing rollover risk.\n\nOverall, the weighted average maturity (WAM) of borrowings stood at about 19.14 years in FY26 so far, compared with 20.66 years in FY25. The weighted average coupon (WAC) of fresh issuances during FY26 (as on 19 January 2026) has declined to 6.65 per cent as compared to 7.11 per cent in FY25.\n\nOver the longer term, the weighted average coupon on outstanding debt has fallen from 7.71 per cent in FY20 to 7.25 per cent in FY25.",

        "full_content": "The Centre is on track to reduce its fiscal deficit to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in FY26, fulfilling the commitment made in FY21 to halve the deficit ratio within five years, the Economic Survey 2025–26 said.\n\n“The government has targeted a fiscal deficit of 4.4 percent for FY26 and is on course to achieve it, thus fulfilling the commitment made in FY21,”  it said.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the survey in Parliament on January 29.\n\n“It is noteworthy that the government was determined to and succeeded in bringing down the fiscal deficit ratio as promised, despite it not being a legislative target,” the survey said, underlining the credibility of the consolidation path.\n\nThe adjustment was achieved even as expenditure quality improved. Fiscal consolidation, it said, took place “even while improving the quality of fiscal expenditure with a concurrent emphasis on capital expenditure”.\n\n“In the year of the pandemic, the fiscal deficit of the Central Government reached 9.2 per cent of GDP, partly on account of pandemic-related and induced expenditure and to a determination to bring below-the-line budget expenditures above the line,” the survey said, recalling the extraordinary fiscal expansion during the Covid-19 shock.\n\nThe sharp widening of the deficit was accompanied by a clear intent to end off-budget practices. “It also aimed to draw a line under such practices in the future,” the survey said, adding at the time, “the finance minister committed to reducing the Central Government’s fiscal deficit ratio by at least half in five years”.\n\nFollow our live blog for the latest on Economic Survey 2025-26\n\nMedium-term fiscal discipline under scrutiny\n\nThe survey emphasised that fiscal credibility has taken on greater importance in the current global environment, where capital flows are sensitive to policy predictability and debt dynamics. With government bonds now included in global indices, investors are increasingly assessing general government finances rather than focusing solely on the Centre.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, meeting the FY26 deficit target assumes particular significance, signalling the government’s intent to anchor expectations through disciplined fiscal management, it said.\n\nThe assessment suggests that adherence to the announced consolidation path, combined with a sustained push towards capital expenditure, has helped balance near-term growth support with medium-term stability, demonstrating that fiscal consolidation and growth-supportive spending need not be mutually exclusive when underpinned by credible policy intent and execution.\n\nCapital expenditure focus and credibility gains\n\nThe survey said the consolidation strategy was not driven by expenditure compression alone but by a reorientation towards growth-supportive spending, with a sustained emphasis on capital expenditure alongside revenue mobilisation and improved expenditure management.\n\nThis approach strengthened fiscal credibility at a time when global investors were increasingly focused on macro stability and medium-term fiscal anchors.\n\n“Among other things, the conservative and prudent approach to fiscal management, which enhanced fiscal credibility, led to India’s sovereign rating upgrades by several credit rating agencies in FY26,” it said.\n\nIndia got credit rating upgrades from multiple agencies in 2025, marking a significant shift after a prolonged period without upgrades. The upgrade by a major global rating agency was India’s first such improvement in nearly two decades, reflecting improved confidence in the country’s macroeconomic and fiscal trajectory, it said.",

        "full_content": "India’s push to rapidly expand data centres and AI compute capacity could face significant bottlenecks due to rising costs, infrastructure constraints and global shortages of critical hardware such as GPUs, the Economic Survey released on January 29 said.\n\nThe Survey said that while sufficient compute capacity is essential for training and developing cutting-edge artificial intelligence models, surging global demand for GPUs and limited supply of key components such as high-bandwidth memory chips and storage are pushing up costs. This could make the financial viability of large-scale data centre expansion increasingly challenging for India.\n\n“Even if the sovereign, domestic investors, or financial institutions are willing to finance data centre expansion, plans may need to be put on hold until GPU supplies are secured,” the Survey noted, highlighting that higher demand from international buyers could choke the availability of GPUs for domestic players.\n\nAccording to the Survey, the interaction between financial constraints, infrastructure readiness and external supply dependencies will determine the pace and scale of India’s AI compute expansion.\n\nIt cautioned that simply making financing available may not be sufficient if other bottlenecks such as grid availability or hardware access remain unresolved.\n\nTo analyse these risks, the Survey has proposed an Agent Based Modelling (ABM) framework, allowing financing, electricity grid capacity and access to hardware to interact through feedback loops. The objective is to identify scenarios where “coordination failures” can emerge, even when demand for AI infrastructure remains strong.\n\nThe government clarified that the exercise is a policy stress test rather than a forecasting tool. It does not attempt to estimate optimal compute capacity or exact investment needs. Instead, it seeks to uncover structural vulnerabilities in India’s AI infrastructure ecosystem and identify leverage points where policy interventions could be most effective.\n\nThe Survey also underlined the limits of price-based or subsidy-led approaches in isolation. When financial constraints, power infrastructure gaps and global hardware shortages coincide, subsidies alone may not accelerate capacity creation.",

        "full_content": "Amidst stability, credit growth has picked up again in the second half of the year. The Economic Survey tabled in Parliament by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on January 29 said that a key factor driving credit growth is a sharp increase in loans against gold jewellery, which have risen by 125.3 percent (YoY), possibly due to rising prices of the yellow metal.\n\n\"In terms of sectoral deployment of non-food credit, among the categories of agriculture and allied activities, industry, services and personalloans,the highest YoY growth has been observed in personal loans, with an increase of 12.8 per cent in November 2025. A significant factor contributing to this growth is a substantial rise in loans against gold jewellery, which have increased by 125.3 per cent (YoY), likely due to the increasing prices of gold,\" the survey said.\n\nAfter moderating earlier in FY26, lending picked up sharply towards the end of 2025. As of December, bank credit was growing at 14.5 per cent year-on-year. Personal loans have led this growth, especially loans against gold jewellery, which have surged due to rising gold prices.\n\nIndia’s banking system has demonstrated strong signs of stability, supported by healthier balance sheets, low bad loans, and consistent profits. Recent data indicates that scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) are in a much better position than a few years ago, and this improvement boosts overall economic confidence.\n\nOne of the biggest positives is asset quality. The gross non-performing asset (GNPA) ratio and net NPA ratio of SCBs have fallen to multi-decadal lows, indicating that banks are better managing stressed loans. At the same time, banks remain well capitalised. The capital-to-risk-weighted-asset ratio stood at a strong 17.2 percent in September 2025, per the economic survey.\n\nThe survey also revealed that bad loans in industry, services, and personal loans declined over the past six months. Industry GNPA fell to 1.9 percent, services to 1.8 percent, and personal loans to 1.1 percent by September.\n\nAgriculture remains a concern, with a higher GNPA of 6 percent, which improved slightly from 6.1 percent in March 2025.\n\nBanks are also recovering more money from stressed assets. Recovery rates have nearly doubled since FY18, aided by improved resolution mechanisms. \"The recovery rate in NPAs in SCBs has approximately doubled from 13.2 per cent in FY18 to 26.2 per cent in FY25,\" stated the Economic Survey.\n\nThe survey showed that the slippage ratio of SCBs, indicating the growth of NPAs relative to standard loans and advances at the start of the fiscal year, improved from 7.1 percent in FY18 to 1.4 percent in FY25, and declined further to 1.3 percent in the September quarter.",

        "full_content": "More and more people are looking to AI for getting budget breakdowns and retirement projections in seconds. It makes you wonder if you still need a human financial advisor at all. After all, an algorithm doesn’t forget details, doesn’t get tired, and doesn’t charge a percentage of your assets.\n\nThe short answer is this: AI can help you build a financial plan, but it still struggles to understand one.\n\nYou can use AI when the problem is structured and data-heavy. Give it your income, expenses, assets, liabilities, expected returns and time horizons, and it can generate scenarios almost instantly. It can model retirement cash flows, test different withdrawal rates, suggest asset allocations, and show how small changes today might affect outcomes decades later.\n\nFor people who like clarity and structure, this is powerful. AI tools are also great for education. They explain concepts, flag obvious gaps, and help you think through “what if” situations without judgement.\n\nUsed well, AI can make financial planning far more accessible and less intimidating.\n\nBut financial planning is not a maths exam. It sits at the intersection of money, behaviour, fear, family and uncertainty.\n\nAI doesn’t really know what it means when someone says, “I want to feel secure,” or “I’m scared of becoming a burden,” or “I don’t trust markets after what I lived through.” It can respond with words, but it doesn’t read between the lines.\n\nA human advisor notices hesitation, contradictions, and emotional blind spots. They recognise when a client says they want high returns but panics at a 10 percent fall. Or when someone insists on retiring early without fully acknowledging health risks or family responsibilities.\n\nThose gaps are often where financial plans fail.\n\nBehaviour matters more than optimisation\n\nMany people don’t run out of money because their plan was mathematically flawed. They run out because they abandoned it at the wrong time.\n\nThey stop investing during market crashes. They overspend when things feel comfortable. They delay uncomfortable decisions like insurance, wills, or reducing lifestyle costs.\n\nAI can recommend the “right” action. It cannot sit across from you and talk you out of a bad one when emotions take over.\n\nA good human advisor often adds value not by maximising returns, but by preventing costly mistakes.\n\nLife doesn’t stay inside templates\n\nAI works best with stable assumptions. Real life rarely cooperates.\n\nCareers change. Health issues appear. Parents age. Children take unexpected paths. Marriages evolve. Some plans need to be redrawn not because the numbers changed, but because priorities did.\n\nA human advisor adapts the plan around life. AI adapts life to the plan. That difference matters.\n\nThink of AI as a very capable co-pilot. It’s excellent for drafting a first version of a plan, stress-testing ideas, comparing options, and staying organised. It can help you prepare better questions, understand trade-offs, and keep track of your progress.\n\nFor people who are financially aware, disciplined, and comfortable making decisions, AI may be enough for large parts of the journey.\n\nBut when decisions involve trade-offs between security and freedom, between family needs and personal goals, or between fear and opportunity, human judgement still plays a critical role.\n\nThe choice isn’t AI or a human advisor. It’s how the two work together. AI reduces costs, improves clarity and democratizes access to planning tools. Human advisors bring context, empathy, accountability and experience.\n\nUsed together, they can produce better outcomes than either could alone.",

        "full_content": "Private investment in India remains constrained not by a lack of intent or financial stress but by deeper structural factors, which keeps corporates cautious on large expenditures, the Economic Survey 2025–26, released on January 29, has said.\n\nWhile public capex has scaled up sharply in recent years and corporate balance sheets are healthier, the survey argued that private investment will not automatically follow unless the cost of capital, institutional frictions and fiscal incentives are addressed more decisively.\n\nA central argument in the survey is that India’s cost of capital remains structurally high, limiting the appetite for long-gestation private projects.\n\nBeyond interest rates and banking spreads, the survey frames this as a macroeconomic outcome of India’s persistent current account deficit and dependence on foreign savings. Countries that rely on external capital, it argued, must pay a risk premium, making capital more expensive across the economy. As a result, even financially strong firms prefer incremental expansion, brownfield projects or services-led growth over large greenfield manufacturing investments.\n\nAccording to the survey, this structural constraint helps explain why India’s private investment response has been uneven despite a sustained public infrastructure push. The survey acknowledged that public capital expenditure has improved logistics, eased supply-side bottlenecks and raised the economy’s potential growth rate. Public capex can crowd in private investment only when complemented by predictable policies, lower input costs and stronger institutional capacity. Without these, public spending risks becoming a ceiling rather than a catalyst for private capex, the survey noted.\n\nThe survey also draws a sharp distinction between productive public investment and transfer-heavy fiscal strategies, particularly at the state level.\n\nWhile Centre's capex and interest-freeloansto states under the Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment scheme have helped protect infrastructure spending, the growing reliance on unconditional cash transfers by several states is flagged as a risk. Such spending, the survey said, raises revenue deficits and crowds out fiscal space for capital formation, indirectly dampening private investment sentiment by weakening the pipeline of infrastructure projects and complementary public goods.\n\nAnother reason for subdued private capex lies in the sectoral skew of investment, the economic survey said.\n\nThe survey explained why private investment has gravitated more towards services than manufacturing. Services firms can scale with lower fixed capital, bypass weak infrastructure, and adapt more quickly to regulatory or market changes. Manufacturing, by contrast, imposes “hard constraints” on land, power, logistics, skills and governance. Until these constraints are addressed comprehensively, private manufacturing investment is likely to remain selective rather than broad-based.\n\nThe survey also cautioned against relying on protectionist trade measures to stimulate private manufacturing investment.\n\nHigh tariffs in upstream sectors, it said , may provide temporary relief to capital-intensive producers but often raise costs for downstream industries, hurting export competitiveness and discouraging scale. Lowering the cost of capital, improving logistics and ensuring reliable energy supply are presented as more effective ways to revive private capex than negotiated tariff protection.\n\nUncertainty in the global environment further complicates the private investment outlook, the survey noted.\n\nIt highlighted rising geopolitical risks, trade fragmentation and volatile capital flows as factors that make firms more cautious about committing to long-term investments. In such an environment, policy credibility, regulatory stability and execution capacity become critical determinants of private investment decisions. Firms are more likely to invest when rules are predictable and approvals time-bound, even if global conditions remain uncertain.\n\nThe survey also pointed to asset monetisation and disinvestment as an underutilised lever to support both public and private investment.\n\nRecycling public capital from mature assets can fund fresh infrastructure projects, reduce pressure on public borrowing and create a pipeline of investable opportunities for long-term private capital, including pension funds and insurers. Done well, this approach can strengthen the link between public capex and private participation.",

While these risks remain manageable, they reinforce the importance of maintaining adequate buffers and policy credibility,” the Survey said.\n\nIndia and the United States have concluded six rounds of talks for a trade deal so far. Both nations have reaffirmed their commitment to continue dialogue with the aim of reaching an early conclusion of a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nThe recent US decision to exempt over 200 agricultural and food products from elevated tariffs marks a constructive shift in India–US trade dynamics. The move restores price competitiveness for key Indian exports, including spices, tea, coffee, nuts, and processed foods, helping offset earlier tariff pressures that had constrained market access, the Survey noted.\n\nThe Survey added that slower growth in key trading partners, tariff-induced trade disruptions, and volatility in capital flows could intermittently weigh on exports and investor sentiment.\n\nHowever, for India, these global conditions translate into external uncertainties rather than immediate macroeconomic stress.",

One-time registration for insurance intermediaries, relaxation of IRDAI approval norms for equity transfers, and the reduction in Net Owned Funds requirements for foreign reinsurers, from Rs 5,000 crore to Rs 1,000 crore, are expected to facilitate market entry, improve risk absorption capacity, and strengthen reinsurance depth in the domestic market.\n\nBeyond capital formation, the Act strengthens consumer trust and market integrity.\n\nThe creation of a Policyholders’ Education and Protection Fund aims to improve insurance awareness and financial literacy, while enhanced regulatory powers for the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), including the authority to disgorge wrongful gains and impose higher penalties, are designed to strengthen compliance and governance standards across insurers and intermediaries.\n\nThe alignment of insurance regulations with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 further integrates the sector with India’s digital public infrastructure, enabling scale while safeguarding policyholder data.",

        "full_content": "India operates just about 0.11 airports per million people, far below the United States’ 47.35 and China’s 0.39, underlining the vast untapped potential for expansion in the country’s civil aviation sector, the Economic Survey 2025–26 tabled by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman January 29 said.\n\nDespite the relatively sparse airport density, India has emerged as the world’s third-largest domestic aviation market, after the US and China. The Survey highlighted that the number of operational airports in the country has more than doubled to 164 in 2025 from 74 in 2014, reflecting a decade of rapid infrastructure creation and policy-led expansion.\n\nFurther capacity is in the pipeline. The government has granted in-principle approval for 24 greenfield airports, of which 13 are already operational, including the much-anticipated Navi Mumbai International Airport. These additions are expected to significantly ease congestion at metro hubs while strengthening regional and urban connectivity.\n\n“India’s civil aviation sector is on a sustained growth trajectory, supported by a conducive policy environment, rising demand and steady infrastructure expansion,” the Survey said. It noted, however, that the sector remains sensitive to global economic cycles and requires continuous capacity upgrades. Even so, current passenger volumes represent only a fraction of the country’s long-term potential.\n\nSince FY20, modernisation projects at airports across the country have increased the combined passenger-handling capacity of operational airports to around 575 million passengers per annum. In FY25, Indian airports handled 412 million passengers, marking a 10 percent increase over 374 million passengers in FY24.\n\nGovernment projections state that annual passenger traffic could rise to 665 million by FY31, driven by rising incomes, improved regional connectivity and continued urbanisation.\n\nA key driver of this growth has been the government’s regional connectivity push. As of FY25, 657 routes connecting 93 airports, including heliports and water aerodromes, have been operationalised, improving access to remote and aspirational regions while keeping air travel affordable.\n\nBuilding on this, the Survey noted that a modified UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) scheme has been announced. The revamped programme aims to connect 120 new destinations and enable air travel for 4 crore passengers over the next decade.\n\nThe Survey also pointed to steady progress in the air cargo segment. Air cargo volumes increased from 2.53 million metric tonnes (MMT) in FY15 to 3.72 MMT in FY25, while 2.95 MMT was handled in FY26 up to December. Growth has been supported by policy reforms, infrastructure upgrades and improved logistics integration.\n\nHowever, after registering a robust 10.5 percent growth in FY25, air cargo expansion moderated to about 5 percent during April–November 2025. According to industry assessments cited in the Survey, the slowdown reflects a mix of factors, including higher operating costs, capacity constraints, geopolitical uncertainties affecting international routes, and a normalisation of demand following strong growth in the previous year.\n\nBeyond airports and airlines, the Survey underscored the importance of a growing ancillary ecosystem. Expansion in airport and air navigation infrastructure, along with the development of Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facilities and aircraft leasing capabilities, is strengthening India’s aviation value chain.\n\n“These developments, coupled with deeper technology integration, position civil aviation as a key driver of nationwide economic connectivity and integration,” the Survey said.\n\nTaken together, the data suggests that while India has made significant strides in expanding its aviation footprint over the past decade, the low airport-to-population ratio leaves ample headroom for long-term growth, reinforcing aviation’s role as a critical enabler of economic development.",

        "full_content": "India’s medium-term growth potential has strengthened to around 7 percent from 6.5 percent earlier, reflecting the cumulative impact of sustained policy reforms, strong macroeconomic fundamentals and improved growth momentum across key indicators, according to the Economic Survey 2025–26.\n\n“Together, the developments make a persuasive case that India’s potential growth has risen to around 7 per cent over the medium term,” the survey said, adding the economy is “positioned on a path of steady expansion amid global uncertainty”.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey in Parliament on January 29.\n\nAccording to the survey, the upward revision in potential growth reflects calibrated improvements across capital accumulation, labour input and trend total factor productivity (TFP). “When combined, these calibrated improvements in capital accumulation, labour input and trend TFP generate an upward shift in potential GDP growth from 6.5 per cent to around 7 per cent over the medium term,” it said.\n\nThe assessment, it added, reflects “the compounding effect of sustained reforms interacting with strong macro-financial fundamentals”. The balance of risks around growth remains “broadly even”, leading to an outlook of “steady growth amid global uncertainty, requiring caution, but not pessimism”.\n\nThe Survey noted that while global uncertainties remain elevated, domestic growth drivers are expected to continue supporting economic activity. “With macroeconomic stability in place and ongoing reform efforts, the economy appears well-positioned to sustain growth in the near term,” it said, outlining an outlook for FY27 shaped primarily by domestic strengths alongside evolving external conditions.\n\nHigh-frequency indicators signal stronger momentum\n\nThe Survey said the revised growth assessment is buttressed by higher growth trends observed in high-frequency indicators in recent years. Growth in e-way bill generation, purchasing managers’ index (PMI) indicators and non-food bank credit has “remained persistently above their respective pre-pandemic averages, rather than reverting to previous growth trends”.\n\n“This performance suggests a more robust underlying pace of economic activity and an improved growth momentum,” the Survey said, pointing to a strengthening of the economy’s medium-term trajectory.\n\nSustained deregulation efforts at the state level are also playing a key role. The Survey said these initiatives are “enabling small and medium enterprises to expand and integrate more effectively into formal value chains, elevating the economy’s medium-term growth potential”.\n\nIn parallel, direct and indirect tax reforms are expected to strengthen revenue flows over the medium term. This, the Survey said, would “directly reduce incremental borrowing requirements and, in turn, the interest burden as fiscal consolidation progresses”.\n\nOver the past three years, reform momentum has strengthened across several areas critical for medium-term growth. Manufacturing-oriented initiatives such as Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, foreign direct investment liberalisation and logistics reforms have supported capacity creation.\n\nThe Survey also pointed to tax simplification and the setting up of high-level committees for regulatory reforms, including those involving state governments, as signalling a shift towards greater regulatory clarity and certainty.\n\nImpact of Labour market reforms in medium term\n\nAs economic activity normalises, labour market reforms have also begun to take effect. The survey said labour law consolidation, reduced regulatory compliance and state-level reforms have “begun to lower frictions in the labour market”.\n\nSustained investments in education, skilling and the apprenticeship ecosystem are strengthening workforce quality and employability. “Taken together, these factors are likely to support a stabilisation of labour input growth over the medium term, at a level higher than pre-pandemic period,” the survey said.",

        "full_content": "India’s insurance sector's biggest change is simple but structural: reducing high distribution and acquisition costs, according to Economic Survey 2026.\n\nUnless these cost inefficiencies are dismantled, insurance will remain expensive for customers and limited in reach, despite the sector’s strong balance sheets and financial stability, the report says.\n\nFor years, the industry has operated in what can be called a “low-penetration, high-cost” model.\n\nInsurance companies are financially strong and well-capitalised, but the cost of selling insurance is too high, the report flags. Expensive distribution channels, heavy commissions, and inefficient acquisition models have pushed up the price of protection. This has made insurance less affordable for large sections of the population, keeping penetration low even as the industry grows in size.\n\nIn the life insurance segment, private insurers are showing healthy topline growth, but profits are not growing at the same pace. Rising acquisition expenses are eating into margins, leaving net profits largely flat.\n\nSimply put, insurers are selling more policies, but earning proportionally less from them because it costs too much to acquire each customer.\n\nThe non-life insurance sector faces a similar challenge, according to the report.\n\nHigh combined ratios mean that underwriting operations are not generating enough profits on their own. To stay profitable, insurers are increasingly relying on investment income to support their core business. This strategy is risky, as it makes profitability dependent on capital market performance rather than on the strength of insurance operations themselves.\n\nThe solution lies in rationalising acquisition and distribution costs, the report suggests.\n\nDigitising distribution, through direct platforms, embedded insurance, partnerships with fintechs and platforms, and technology-led sales models, can significantly reduce the cost of reaching customers. Lower costs would allow insurers to price products more accurately, offer better value to policyholders, and make insurance more affordable.",

        "full_content": "The Centre has significantly strengthened the regulatory enforcement framework for the insurance sector by raising the maximum penalty for violations by insurers tenfold, from Rs 1 crore to Rs 10 crore, while also empowering the regulator to order disgorgement of wrongful gains, according to the Economic Survey 2025-26.\n\nAccording to the report, the enhanced powers have been granted to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), enabling it to direct insurers and intermediaries to return any unlawful profits earned through regulatory breaches, mis-selling, or non-compliance with statutory provisions.\n\nThe move marks a sharp tightening of supervisory oversight aimed at strengthening policyholder protection and improving market discipline.\n\nUnder the revised framework, insurers that default in complying with, or act in contravention of, the provisions of the Insurance Act or the IRDAI Act will now face penalties of up to Rs 10 crore, compared with the earlier ceiling of Rs 1 crore.\n\nInsurance intermediaries, including brokers, agents and other distribution entities, have also been explicitly brought within the scope of this penal provision, widening the accountability net across the sector’s value chain.\n\nThe Survey noted that the combination of higher financial penalties and disgorgement powers is intended to act as a strong deterrent against regulatory violations, particularly in areas such as mis-selling, unfair business practices, governance lapses and systemic non-compliance.\n\nDisgorgement provisions allow the regulator to strip violators of economic benefits derived from wrongdoing, making regulatory breaches financially unattractive rather than merely a cost of doing business.",

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey 2025-26 has made an unambiguous pitch for capital expenditure as the central pillar of India’s growth strategy, arguing that sustained public investment in infrastructure has lifted the economy’s potential growth rate while crowding in private investment.\n\nThe survey, often described as the government’s report card on the economy, contrasts capital spending with transfer-heavy expenditure, warning that the latter offers only transient welfare gains, while capex delivers durable improvements in productivity, incomes and competitiveness.\n\nAt the Centre, the rebalancing of expenditure towards capital formation is presented as one of the most significant post-pandemic fiscal shifts.\n\nCapital expenditure has been scaled up from an average of about 1.7 percent of GDP in the pre-Covid period to around 3 percent of GDP after the pandemic, with effective capital expenditure reaching close to 4 percent of GDP in FY25. This expansion was made possible by a sharp rationalisation of revenue expenditure, which declined from 13.6 percent of GDP in FY22 to 10.9 percent in FY25, creating fiscal space for productive asset creation\n\nThe survey credits this improvement in expenditure quality for helping India sustain high public investment even while consolidating its fiscal deficit.\n\nFollow our live blog for the latest on Economic Survey 2025-26\n\nBetween FY20 and FY25, the share of capital spending in total central government expenditure rose from roughly 12.5 percent to 22.6 percent, a shift that has coincided with faster infrastructure build-out and easing of supply-side constraints. Rating agencies, which upgraded India’s sovereign rating in 2025, explicitly cited this pivot towards growth-enhancing capex as a key factor underpinning fiscal credibility\n\nThe survey highlighted infrastructure expansion, particularly in transport and logistics, as a major contributor to the upward revision in India’s potential growth rate to 7 percent. The survey pointed to the rapid expansion of airports, highways and inland waterways as reducing transaction costs and improving economy-wide efficiency, reinforcing the argument that public investment is now yielding tangible productivity dividends.\n\nThe survey also highlighted the role of the Centre in protecting capital expenditure at the state level through the Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI) scheme. Launched during the pandemic, the scheme provides 50-year interest-freeloansto states specifically for capital spending. Allocations under SASCI have risen sharply from Rs 12,000 crore in FY21 to Rs 1.5 lakh crore in FY26, with cumulative releases of nearly Rs 4.5 lakh crore since inception. As a result, state capital expenditure has remained broadly stable at around 2.4 percent of GDP despite rising fiscal pressures\n\nHowever, the survey also strikes a cautionary note. It flags the growing use of unconditional cash transfers by several states, warning that these schemes are increasing revenue deficits and crowding out growth-enhancing capital and human capital investments.\n\nWhile such transfers provide short-term income support, the survey argues they weaken long-term growth by diverting scarce fiscal resources away from infrastructure and productive asset creation\n\nThe survey underscored the need for recycling public capital through asset monetisation and strategic disinvestment. It suggests that proceeds from equity monetisation in public sector enterprises should increasingly be channelled into future-oriented infrastructure and technology investments, including through platforms such as the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), to sustain the capex cycle without overburdening public balance sheets\n\nThe broader message from the Economic Survey is that India’s capex push is no longer a counter-cyclical response but a structural strategy.\n\nCapital expenditure is positioned as the bridge between fiscal consolidation and long-term growth, with infrastructure spending seen as essential for crowding in private investment, improving export competitiveness and strengthening macroeconomic resilience. The survey’s warning is equally clear that diluting this strategy through populist spending risks undermining the very growth momentum that public investment has helped create.",

        "full_content": "If you own shares or equity mutual funds and need cash urgently, a loan against shares (LAS) can help. Taking a loan against your shares means you won’t have to sell your investments, avoid a capital gains tax at that moment, and the interest rate is often lower than an unsecured personal loan.\n\nBut LAS is not “easy money”. It is a secured loan tied tightly to market movements, and that changes the risk equation in ways many borrowers underestimate.\n\nWhat exactly is a loan against shares?\n\nWhen taking a loan against shares you can borrow money by pledging your listed shares or equity mutual fund units as collateral. The shares remain in your name, and you continue to get dividends or corporate benefits, but the lender has the right to sell them if you are unable to pay off the loan.\n\nTheseloansare offered by banks, NBFCs and brokers through a pledge mechanism linked to your DEMAT account. The loan amount is usually a percentage of the market value of the pledged securities, known as the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio.\n\nFor most equity shares, the LTV is around 40-50 percent. For equity mutual funds, it can go up to 50-60 percent, depending on the fund and the lender.\n\nHow the money is disbursed and repaid\n\nOnce your shares are pledged, the loan is either disbursed as a lump sum or set up as an overdraft facility. Interest is charged only on the amount you use, not on the full sanctioned limit.\n\nThis flexibility makes LAS attractive for short-term needs like business cash flow gaps, bridge financing, or covering an unexpected expense without disturbing long-term investments.\n\nRepayment terms vary. Some lenders expect periodic interest payments with the principal repaid at the end, while others allow partial repayments anytime.\n\nThe real risk: Market movements\n\nThis is where loans against shares differ sharply from most other loans.\n\nIf the market falls and the value of your pledged shares drops, your LTV shoots up automatically. When it crosses the lender’s comfort level, you get a margin call. That means you must either add more shares, bring in cash, or repay part of the loan.\n\nIf you don’t act quickly, the lender has the right to sell your shares to recover the loan, often at precisely the wrong time from an investor’s perspective.\n\nThis forced selling risk is the single biggest drawback of LAS.\n\nCosts you should look beyond interest rates\n\nInterest rates on LAS are usually lower than personal loans, but they are not the only cost. There may be pledge charges, renewal fees, and penal interest if margins are breached.\n\nAlso, because the loan is linked to volatile assets, the “mental cost” of constantly tracking markets is real. A sharp correction can turn a calm borrowing decision into a stressful one overnight.\n\nWhen a loan against shares makes sense\n\nLAS works best when the borrowing need is short-term and predictable, and when the pledged portfolio is diversified and not excessively volatile.\n\nIt can also make sense if selling your shares would trigger a large capital gains tax or disrupt a long-term investment plan, and you are confident you can repay or reduce the loan quickly.\n\nBusiness owners and self-employed professionals often use LAS as a temporary liquidity tool rather than a long-term borrowing solution.\n\nIf your income is uncertain, your shares are concentrated in a few stocks, or you are already uncomfortable with market volatility, LAS can amplify stress.\n\nIt is also a poor choice for long-term consumption spending. Using volatile assets to fund lifestyle expenses over many years increases the risk of forced liquidation.\n\nIf you cannot meet a margin call without selling the same shares you pledged, the structure is already too risky.\n\nA loan against shares is not inherently good or bad. It is a sharp financial tool that works well in specific situations and cuts badly in others.\n\nUsed thoughtfully, it can provide low-cost liquidity without derailing your investment journey. Used casually, it can push you into selling quality assets at the worst possible time.\n\nBefore taking one, ask yourself not just whether the interest rate is attractive, but whether you are prepared for what happens if markets move against you.",

There is no threat of higher inflation from higher-priced crude oil imports now.\n\nThe rupee underperformed in 2025. India runs a trade deficit in goods. Its net trade surplus in services and remittances is not enough to offset it. India depends on foreign capital flows to maintain a healthy balance of payments. When they run drier, rupee stability becomes a casualty, survey said.\n\nDomestic currency has been under pressure in the last few months, especially after the US imposed tariffs on India. Further it cam under pressure due to dumping of Indian equities by the foreign investors, delay in India-US trade deal, and rally in the Japanese bond yield.\n\nEven after this, the intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) remained limited to protect the currency from the sharp depreciation.\n\nThe local currency sanks to a new low of 92.0163 against the US dollar this morning.",

Infrastructure projects delivered healthy execution internationally, while domestic execution was impacted by headwinds in central-funded water projects. Energy projects continued to see strong execution; however, cost overruns in select hydrocarbon projects weighed on margins, which are expected to remain soft over the next 2-3 quarters. In Hi-tech manufacturing, an execution ramp-up in Precision Engineering drove growth, while L&T’s participation in the 87 MALE drone procurement program with its technology partner, General Atomics, further strengthens its growth prospects. Management remains optimistic, supported by an anticipated pickup in private capex, an improving share of private-sector opportunities (~35% of domestic infrastructure prospects), and expansion into new verticals such as data centers, semiconductors, and electrolyzers, while reiterating its ~15% YoY revenue growth guidance and ~8.5% P&M margins for FY26.\n\nWe maintain our ‘Buy’ rating valuing the core business at a PE of 22x Sep’27E (same as earlier) arriving at a SoTP-derived TP of Rs4,806 (Rs4,766 earlier).\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

GE Vernova T&D India (GVTD) reported a strong quarter with 58.4% YoY revenue growth and a 1000bps YoY improvement in EBITDA margin to 26.7%. On the back of sustained execution strength over the past few quarters, management has upgraded its FY26 EBITDA margin guidance to the higher end of mid-20s (mid20’s earlier). During the quarter, GVTD secured a VSC-HVDC order (Khavda– South Olpad), which is expected to be booked in subsequent quarters having a ~4-year execution timeline. Domestic order pipeline remains robust, led by TBCB opportunities generating across states, while export order in pipeline experienced a delay from the customer side now expected in H2FY27. Adequate existing capacity provides headroom to execute HVDC KhavdaSouth Olpad projects alongside potential new HVDC wins. Ongoing capex of ~Rs10bn through FY28 and effective raw-material pass-through mechanisms support operating leverage and margin resilience.\n\nWe believe 1) a healthy order pipeline in the power market, 2) a robust order book (Rs143.8bn), and 3) the management’s focus on margin improvement augur well for strong revenue & profit growth of GVTD. The stock is trading at a P/E of 51.7x/42.6x on FY27/28E. We maintain our ‘BUY’ rating with a revised TP of Rs4,050 (Rs4,005 earlier) valuing the stock at a PE of 65x Sep’27E (same as earlier).\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey said that India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has a big role in expanding the credit uptake among a new segment of users across smaller towns of the country.\n\nThe country's digital payments ecosystem closed 2025 on a record note, with UPI transactions hitting fresh highs in both value and volume in December, reinforcing the platform’s position as the country’s default retail payment rail.\n\n\"DPI payment interfaces, such as UPI, provide transaction data to assess creditworthiness,\" it said, adding that while the expansion of bank accounts is a necessary foundation, it is the effective use of those accounts that ultimately determines whether financial inclusion translates into meaningful\n\n\"A growing body of research shows that a public, interoperable payment infrastructure can play a catalytic role in this transition by converting basic access into active financial participation,\" the Economic Survey said.\n\nUPI is the world’s largest real-time payments system and processes over 21 billion transactions every month worth more than Rs 27 lakh crore, reflecting deep adoption across consumers and merchants. December 2025 turned into another milestone month, with UPI transaction volumes touching 21.6 billion, the highest ever recorded, surpassing 20.47 billion in November 2025.\n\nTransaction value rose to Rs 28 lakh crore, up from Rs 26.3 lakh crore a month earlier and above the previous peak of Rs 27.3 lakh crore seen in October 2025.\n\nThe Economic Survey said that UPI bridges the gap between account ownership and access to formal credit by generating verifiable transaction histories and sharply reducing transaction costs. It also noted the role of fintechs in enabling the credit uptake.\n\n\"Digital Public Infrastructure reshapes credit markets by enabling banks and fintechs to expand lending across the risk spectrum, with fintechs playing a distinctive role in reaching new-to-credit borrowers who were previously excluded from formal finance,\" the Survey said.\n\nRegions with affordable internet and widespread bank account penetration experienced the\n\nstrongest credit expansion, underscoring the layered nature of financial inclusion and the complementary roles of incumbents and new entrants.\n\nEconomic Survey also noted that the growth in credit linked to digital payments did not come at the cost of higher default rates, the richer transaction data allowed lenders to better identify\n\nunderserved but creditworthy borrowers.\n\n\"This evidence highlights the power of publicly provided, interoperable infrastructure to support inclusion at scale and to align technological change with macro-level financial development,\" it added.\n\nGrowth remains strong, but the pace moderates\n\nDespite a high base, growth momentum remained resilient through the year. Transaction volumes expanded 29.3 percent year-on-year in December 2025, while transaction value grew 20.3 percent, indicating that expansion is being driven more by deeper penetration and behavioural change than by rising ticket sizes.\n\nDecember marked the second instance in 2025 where volume growth slipped below 30 percent, suggesting a gradual normalisation in growth rates after several years of rapid expansion, albeit from a much higher base.\n\nA year of sharp scale-up for UPI\n\nOver the full year, UPI’s scale-up has been pronounced. Annual transaction volumes increased from 172.2 billion in 2024 to 228.3 billion in 2025, while transaction values rose from Rs 246.8 lakh crore to Rs 299.7 lakh crore, taking annual digital payments close to the Rs 300 lakh crore mark.\n\nThe platform is now embedded across grocery purchases, fuel payments, dining, local mobility, bill payments and a widening range of low-value merchant transactions.",

        "full_content": "IT shares declined up to 3 percent on Thursday after two sessions of gains, as investors booked profits across the sector. Stocks such as Persistent Systems, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCL Technologies led the losses amid selling pressure.\n\nThe Nifty IT index, which had risen 1.2 percent over the previous two sessions, gave up those gains and fell 1.5 percent in trade.\n\nKey factors behind the decline\n\n1) US Federal Reserve decision:The fall came after the US Federal Reserve held interest rates, in line with expectations, citing elevated inflation and resilient economic growth. Markets are not pricing in another rate cut until the June policy meeting. Higher US interest rates tend to support the dollar and Treasury yields, making emerging markets such as India relatively less attractive for foreign investors.\n\n\"The Fed decision is likely to lead to short-term challenges in US rate-sensitive sectors. Globally, this may lead to a slight market decline as investors adjust to the expectation of no immediate rate cuts,\" said Rajesh Palviya, Head of Research at Axis Securities.\n\nThe Indian IT sector, valued at about USD 283 billion, derives a significant portion of its revenue from the United States, making developments in the world’s largest economy critical for the industry.\n\n2) Profit booking:After the recent rally, profit booking was seen across IT stocks, leading the Nifty IT index to surrender all its gains from the past two sessions.\n\nShares ofTCSdeclined more than 2 percent, whilePersistent Systemsemerged as the biggest laggard, falling up to 3 percent. Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Infosys and HCL Technologies were down up to 1 percent. All ten constituents of the Nifty IT index were trading in the red.\n\n3) Weak US dollar:The US dollar extended its losses this week, slipping to a four-year low against a basket of currencies. A weaker dollar can weigh on Indian IT companies as it reduces the value of dollar-denominated revenues when converted into rupees, impacting earnings visibility for export-oriented firms.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Dumping of Indian equities by the foreign investors, delay in India-US trade deal and rally in the Japanese bond yield have added to the pressure.\n\nEven after this, the intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) remained limited to protect the currency from the sharp depreciation.\n\nThe survey said India’s inflation, headline and core, excluding precious metals, will likely be higher in FY27 than in FY26.\n\nIn December, the RBI revised its inflation projections for FY26 from 2.6 per cent to 2 percent, owing to a good kharif harvest and healthy rabi sowing. The IMF has projected an inflation rate of 2.8 percent in FY26 and 4 percent in FY27, the survey said.\n\nThe RBI’s forecast for headline Inflation for Q1 and Q2 of FY27 currently stands at 3.9 and 4 per cent, survey added.\n\nOn January 22, a Moneycontrol poll of 14 economists, bank treasury heads and fund managers on RBI policy expectation on rate action in February found that experts were divided on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation projections. Some experts said the central bank may remain in wait and watch mode before revising inflation forecast ahead of the new base year series for GDP and CPI.\n\nIndia’s inflation firmed up in December, rising to a three-month high of 1.33 percent from 0.7 percent in November, government data released on January 12 showed.\n\nEven with the uptick, headline inflation has now stayed below the RBI’s lower tolerance threshold of 2 percent for four consecutive months, underlining how price pressures have cooled meaningfully since the middle of the year.",

        "full_content": "India's external sector has remained strong owing to deepening global intergration , resilient services trade and expanding trade network, the Economic Survey for 2025-26 which was tabled in Parliament on January 29 said.\n\nThe government document released three days before the presentation of the Budget said India would needed a strong export-oriented policy to achieve strong export growth.\n\n\"A robust and stable currency can only be achieved through export competitiveness. History demonstrates that countries with sustained manufacturing export success are those that have maintained hard currency status, characterised by currency stability and strength,\" the survey noted.\n\nCAD stood at 1.3 percent of the GDP at the end of the September quarter. In FY25, current account deficit had narrowed to 0.6 percent.\n\n\"India’s external sector enters this phase of global fragmentation with strengthened buffers, diversified trade linkages and improving resilience. The policy challenge lies in leveraging these strengths to sustain external stability while supporting a high-growth trajectory in a world where global integration is increasingly shaped by strategic, rather than purely economic considerations,\" the survey highlighted.\n\nHowever, deficit is likely to remain contained this year with services exports making up for some of the slowdown in merchandise exports.\n\nIndia’s services exports at $304 billion in the first nine months of the year were nearly 7 percent higher compared to the previous year.\n\nUntil Q2, remittances were 10.7 percent higher compared with the previous year.\n\nUS tariffs are expected to keep the pressure on trade but India’s diversification play seems to have provided some relief. The country has finalised four trade agreements in the past year alone, having signed deals with the UK, New Zealand, Oman and the European Union.\n\nIts trade deal with European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which counts Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland as its members, came into force this year.\n\nAMoneycontrolanalysis shows that these deals will help cushion the impact of US tariffs once they take effect. Of the roughly $47 billion Indian exports facing 50 percent or more in US levies, nearly $40 billion , or 84 percent, can be absorbed by the EU alone.\n\nIndia exported $3.1 billion worth of precious metal jewellery to the US in 2024 but only $784 million to the EU. The bloc imported $17.2 billion worth of precious metal jewellery during the year, leaving a large untapped market.\n\nSimilarly, in seafood, India exported close to $1.9 billion worth of frozen shrimp to the US in 2024, while shipments to the EU were roughly a third of that value. Total EU imports of frozen shrimp stood at about $3.9 billion, suggesting room for India to scale up exports if tariff and non-tariff barriers are eased.",

Deflation in food prices persisted for seventh straight month, with the December reading at -2.71 percent.\n\n\"The trajectory of core inflation will need to be closely monitored in the context of monetary policy easing and potential upward pressures from global base metal prices,” the survey said, pointing to new CPI series having implications for inflation assessment and warranting careful interpretation of price dynamics.\n\nStarting February 12, the CPI series will shift to a new 2024 base, with an updated consumption basket that includes more items and assigns a higher weight to non-food components, which will also help contain food related volatility.\n\nCiting IMF data, the survey said inflation to average 2 percent this fiscal, may not exceed 4 percent coming fiscal as well.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India expects inflation to average 2 percent for FY26 and 4 percent in the first half of FY27.\n\nIn a Moneycontrol poll conducted in October, economists pegged FY27 inflation at around 4 percent as well.\n\nGST rate cuts have also started showing up in inflation.\n\nAn earlier analysis by Moneycontrol found that prices in consumer electronics and automobiles fell sharply between September and December, marking a far stronger pass-through than seen in recent years.\n\nAverage prices declined 3.6 percent over the September–December period. This is in contrast to the same months in 2024 and 2023, when prices in these categories barely moved, falling by just 0.3 percent on average.\n\nInflation has taken a backseat when it comes to perceptions as well.\n\nGlobal uncertainty has emerged as the single biggest concern for economists heading into the FY27 Budget, overtaking domestic inflation and fiscal risks, according to a pre-Budget poll of 20 economists.\n\nWhen asked about their primary concern for the economy, six respondents cited US and global headwinds, making it the most frequently flagged risk. These include trade protectionism, slowing global growth, and heightened geopolitical tensions.\n\nCXOs seem less concerned about inflation as well.\n\nOver half of the respondents were confident in policymakers controlling inflation below the RBI’s target rate of 4 percent, which also contributed to brighter outlook for cost of capital.\n\nOver two-thirds of respondents expected the central bank to cut rates in FY27.\n\nThe RBI has cut rates by 125 basis points since the start of 2025, bringing the policy rate to 5.25 percent.\n\nEconomists have pencilled in another rate cut in the February meeting following the Budget announcement.",

        "full_content": "India’s economy is expected to log 6.8 -7.2 percent growth in the coming year, according to the Economic Survey tabled by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on January 29.\n\n“With domestic drivers playing a dominant role and macroeconomic stability well anchored, the balance of risks around growth remains broadly even. Taking these considerations together, the Economic Survey projects real GDP growth in FY27 in the range of 6.8 to 7.2 per cent,” the Economic Survey noted.\n\nThe government’s estimate is higher than the International Monetary Fund’s forecast of 6.4 percent and World Bank’s projection of 6.5 percent growth.\n\nThe Economic Survey this time has been released two days before the presentation of the Union Budget where all eyes will be on the finance minister to continue the growth momentum and attract private capex.\n\nThe Indian economy will likely grow 7.4 percent in 2025-26, according to the first advance estimates released by the government earlier this month.\n\nReal GDP growth rose to 8 percent in the first half of the year, with the economy logging 7.8 percent growth in the first quarter and 8.2 percent in the second quarter of the year.\n\nWhile the RBI projects 7.3 percent growth for this fiscal, with 7 percent projection for Q3 and 6.5 percent for Q4, economy could still surprise on the upside.\n\nMoneycontrol’s Eco Pulse, a real-time tracker of economic momentum, indicated a steady momentum in December with a value of 53.7 helped by stronger industrial activity and robust rural demand. A reading of above 50 indicates stronger than average growth, while below 50 reading signals moderation.\n\nThe recovery in FY26 was driven largely by investment and manufacturing. Investment emerged as a key growth engine, expanding 7.8 percent compared with 7.1 percent in previous year.\n\nEconomists in a Moneycontrol survey were hopeful of the economy hitting 10.1 percent nominal growth in FY27, while over 70 percent respondents to a Moneycontrol CXO poll highlighted optimism about economy growing over 6.5 percent plus in FY27.\n\nNearly one in five respondents in the pre-Budget survey expect India’s economy to grow above 7 percent in FY27, a sharp improvement from last year when only a small fraction of corporate leaders were extremely optimistic about growth. The share of pessimistic respondents also dropped sharply. Only 6.5 percent of CXOs now expect growth to slip below 6 percent, compared with 15.6 percent in the previous year’s survey, pointing to improving confidence in the domestic macroeconomic environment.",

        "full_content": "Wondering if you can save on capital gains if you invest ancestral house sale proceeds in bonds and property? Today’s Ask Wallet Wise explains how the exemption works under sections 54 and 54EC.\n\nMy grandmother purchased a residential house property in 1956. It was bequeathed to me and I have mutated it in my name in 2024. If I sell it now, can I invest the entire proceeds in bonds and property to save capital gains?\n\nExpert’s Advice: Though there is no cost of assets received as a gift from specified relatives or as inheritance, either under a will or under personal law, the cost for the purpose of computing the capital gain is taken to be the cost for which the same was purchased by the last owner who had paid for it.\n\nFor capital assets acquired before April 1, 2001, the fair market value on that date can be taken as the cost for the computation of capital gains. As the house acquired in 1956 was received by you as an inheritance, you can opt to take the fair market value on April 1, 2001, as your cost for computing the capital gains. Likewise, the holding period for determining whether the capital asset has become a long-term asset or not is also counted from the date on which the same was acquired by the last owner who had paid for it.\n\nSince the holding period of the residential house is more than two years, the difference between the sale price and the fair market value (as discussed above) will be taxed as long-term capital gains in your hands. To save tax on such long-term capital gains, you have two options, which can be used singularly or in combination. Please note that under both options, you have to invest only the long-term capital gains and not the entire sale proceeds.\n\nThe first option is available under Section 54, where you invest the unindexed long-term capital gains for the purchase or construction of another residential house in India within the prescribed time period.\n\nFor buying a ready-to-move-in house, the investment has to be made within two years from the date of sale of the existing house. Even if you buy a residential house within a year before the date of sale of the existing residential house, exemption under Section 54 can be claimed.  For self-construction or booking an under-construction house, a longer period of three years is available from the date of sale of the house, within which the construction of the house needs to be completed and possession obtained.\n\nThe amount which is not utilised for the purchase or construction of the house by the due date of filing your income tax return is required to be deposited in a bank account under the Capital Gains Account Scheme. The deposited money has to be used within the time prescribed for the purpose of buying or constructing the residential house.\n\nThe second option is under Section 54EC. You have to invest the long-term capital gains in Capital Gain Bonds of a specified financial institution within six months from the date of sale of the existing house.  A maximum of Rs 50 lakhs can be invested in these bonds in one financial year, as well as for claiming exemption in respect of a single year.",

The broader crypto market slipped after the US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at 3.5 percent–3.75 percent, wiping $2.9 trillion off the market.\n\n\"The drop was led by bitcoin’s falling below $88,000 amid low liquidity and cautious sentiment. The cryptocurrency, however, stayed rangebound between $86,000–$91,000, with open interest concentrated near $90,000 ahead of Friday’s options expiry. For now, crypto markets appear locked in consolidation-active, but waiting for a decisive macro or technical catalyst,\" said Riya Sehgal, Research Analyst, Delta Exchange.\n\nCoinSwitch Markets desk said, \"From a technical perspective, $90K remains key resistance, with a sustained break required to unlock upside toward $91K–$92K, while $89K continues to act as strong near-term support, where buyers have repeatedly stepped in.\"\n\nEthereum was down 1.95 percent, Tehter 0.03 percent, XRP 1.67 percent, Solana 3.16 percent, Dogecoin 2.20 percent, and Cardano 2.04 percent.

Gold continues to mark new highs, which has negatively impacted the crypto markets as the liquidity appears to have rotated into traditional assets,\" said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\nAccording to Avinash Shekhar, Co-Founder & CEO, Pi42, bitcoin’s inability to sustain a move above $90,000 is more indicative of short-term hesitation than structural weakness. \"The fact that bitcoin is hovering near key technical zones with clearly defined liquidation thresholds shows that participants are positioning carefully around upcoming catalysts rather than exiting aggressively,\" he said.\n\n\"Derivatives data suggest positioning has tightened, keeping volatility contained for now. As macro clarity improves and liquidity conditions normalise,\" Shekhar said. Bitcoin’s ability to defend the range should support the next leg of the move toward higher levels, including the $95,000.\n\nWhat’s happening in the crypto market?\n\nHere’s a rundown of the crypto market according to WazirX founder Nischal Shetty and CoinDCX research team:",

        "full_content": "Harmonising the rules under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act has emerged as a significant issue for rural housing finance ahead of Budget 2026.\n\nLenders say inconsistent enforcement across states slows loan recovery, raises risks and makes banks hesitant to lend in villages and small towns. For borrowers, this often results in fewer options, higher interest rates and long delays in approving homeloans.\n\n“We recommend budgetary measures for more credit supply to the rural and lower middle-income segments in India. To achieve this, the Union Budget 2026 can include measures for liberalising branch-opening norms for gold loan NBFCs to accelerate outreach and deepen market penetration, especially for secured gold loans which carry relatively lower risk,” Muthoot FinCorp Ltd CEO Shaji Varghese said.\n\nRationalising capital risk weights for gold loans by NBFCs can lower lending costs and promote increased credit flow to rural and semi-urban markets.\n\nHarmonising SARFAESI Act applicability for NBFCs in line with banks and housing finance companies (HFCs) will help drive rural housing credit and strengthen recovery mechanisms for smaller-ticket mortgage loans, Varghese said.\n\nIt should also offer targeted schemes to ensure customers who experienced temporary or one-time credit default are not permanently excluded from formal banking channels . The Budget should also promote formalisation of gold lending by encouraging policy reforms that shift activity from informal channels to regulated institutions and strengthen consumer protection, he said.\n\nThe SARFAESI Act authorises banks and financial institutions to recover non-performing assets (NPAs) without the intervention of courts. It enables lenders to seize, manage and auction secured properties, residential and commercial, to recover loans if a borrower defaults, typically after a 60-day notice period.\n\n\"The Union Budget 2026 can play a meaningful role by deepening domestic liquidity and strengthening risk-sharing frameworks such as credit guarantees and co-lending structures. These measures can help lower borrowing costs, support longer and more predictable tenures, and create repayment structures that offer greater certainty to borrowers,\" Godrej Capital MD & CEO Manish Shah said.\n\nEncouraging stable long-term savings and recognising high levels of tax compliance can further strengthen the funding base of the financial system and reinforce trust in formal participation. \"The objective is not just to build a larger financial ecosystem, but a more resilient and efficient one, where capital flows productively, risk is shared responsibly and finance supports India’s next phase of inclusive and sustainable growth,” Shah said.\n\nAs the government looks for ways to promote affordable housing and increase formal credit in rural areas, experts say clearer and standardised SARFAESI rules can enable lending opportunities. A more predictable recovery process will encourage banks to explore deeper into the countryside, where housing demand is growing but access to finance remains limited, they say.",

        "full_content": "Silver has stolen the spotlight in the commodities world, driven by strong industrial demand, global economic uncertainty and surging prices.\n\nLike gold, silver is increasingly seen not just as a hedge against inflation and currency volatility but as a strategic asset class in diversified portfolios. Data from Ace MF shows Indian silver exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reported spectacular gains with one-year returns of more than 270  percent and three-year gains near 70 percent across most funds underscoring bullion’s powerful move.\n\nThe silver ETF ecosystem has grown rapidly, attracting inflows as investors seek regulated, liquid exposure to rising prices without the hassles of owning physical metal. A wide array of ETFs now lets you participate in silver’s upside via your demat account with transparency and cost efficiency.\n\nTop silver ETFs by performance and size\n\nAccording to the latest AUM and performance data, Nippon India Silver ETF leads the pack with assets of nearly Rs 28,944-crore and a one-year return of 272 percent . ICICI Prudential Silver ETF follows with Rs 14,828-crore AUM and a 274 percent gain over one year.\n\nOther large funds such as HDFC Silver ETF, SBI Silver ETF and Kotak Silver ETF also delivered robust results, with one-year returns clustering around the 270-plus mark. Notably, Tata Silver ETF reported the highest year-to-date absolute performance at 708 percent , reflecting heightened momentum in silver prices. Lesser-sized offerings from DSP, Axis and UTI also posted similar stellar gains, illustrating how silver’s rally has lifted nearly the entire ETF category.\n\nWhy silver ETFs are gaining traction\n\nSilver’s dual identity as both a precious and industrial metal has boosted its appeal. Strong demand from solar panel manufacturing, electronics and other tech sectors, coupled with safe-haven buying during uncertain times, has underpinned prices.\n\nUnlike physical silver, ETFs eliminate concerns about storage, purity and safety, and can be traded like stocks on exchanges. This ease of access has helped propel total AUM in combined gold and silver ETFs beyond ₹1 lakh crore, establishing them as mainstream investment vehicles.\n\nAccording to market watchers, the expanding investor base for precious metal ETFs signals a shift toward passive, regulated instruments that offer transparency along with bullion exposure.\n\nSilver ETF Taxation: What investors should know\n\nTaxation can materially affect net returns from silver ETFs. In India, silver ETFs are treated as listed securities for tax purposes. If held for more than 12 months, gains qualify as long-term capital gains and are taxed at a flat 12.5 percent on the amount exceeding the basic exemption, without indexation benefits. Selling within 12 months triggers short-term capital gains, which are taxed at the investor’s slab rate.\n\nFor comparison, physical silver typically attracts long-term capital gains tax at 20 percent with indexation if held for over three years, though digital silver and ETFs streamline holding periods and tax treatment.\n\nSilver ETFs have been standout performers, reflecting strong price action and investor enthusiasm in 2025–26. They offer a cost-efficient, liquid way to access silver’s upside without physical handling. However, like all commodity-linked assets, they can be volatile and are best used as part of a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk appetite and investment horizon. The commodity exposure should be 10-15 percent of your portfolio.",

Also, heightened uncertainty boosts safe-haven demand as investors seek assets less exposed to policy error or fiscal strain.\n\n\"The January FED meeting held the base rate as largely expected, with Chair Powell striking a balanced but cautious tone. He acknowledged that the labour market is becoming more stable, but job growth is slowing as labour force participation declines and demand softens, with some of this being linked to AI in the near-term,\" Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead at VT Markets.\n\nInflation remains above target but is broadly in line with expectations. At the same time, incoming data points to clearly stronger growth and a better overall outlook, giving the FED confidence to stay patient rather than trying to pre-empt.\n\nPowell again continued to stress that policy will remain firmly data-driven. With risks to both inflation and employment having diminished and expectations in line, Powell said ‘’rate hikes are not anyone’s base case’’. Further cuts would be warranted if the labour market weakens, if labour risks re-emerge, or if tariff-related price pressures fade. He also warned that the US budget deficit is unsustainable, underscoring longer-term fiscal risks that complicate the policy backdrop.\n\n\"Globally, this dynamic can loosen financial conditions outside the US, supporting emerging market assets and commodities, while keeping risk sentiment fragile. Equities may grind higher, but with higher cross-asset volatility as markets adjust to a Fed that is increasingly sensitive to downside risks,\" Maxwell said.\n\nOutlook: Will gold continue its momentum?\n\n\"Gold traded strongly positive with gains... on MCX.  Ongoing tariff uncertainty from the US and continued allocation into safe-haven assets have further supported the rally. However, after such a sharp and extended upmove, gold is entering an overheated zone where volatility can increase,\" said Jateen Trivedi, VP research analyst, commodity and currency, LKP Securities.\n\nThe US central bank kept the policy rate unchanged after Fed policymakers voted 10-2 to hold the central bank's benchmark interest rate in the 3.50-3.75 percent range. The US unemployment rate in December stood at 4.4 percent. The yield on the 10-year Treasury is up at 4.25 percent, and the two-year Treasury yield is at around 3.57 percent.\n\nGold also surged amid ongoing tension between the US and Iran and the crises in Ukraine and Gaza. US President Donald Trump's 100 percent tariff threat against Canada if it strikes a trade deal with China and warning of a 25 levy against South Korea have intensified the safe-haven demand in bullion.",

        "full_content": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will table the Economic Survey in both Houses of Parliament on January 29, 2026, at 11 a.m., setting the macroeconomic and policy backdrop for the Union Budget to be presented on February 1.\n\nThe Economic Survey 2025–26 is expected to present an assessment of India’s growth trajectory, labour market trends and investment outlook at a time when the economy has shown resilience amid global uncertainty. The document is likely to build on last year’s narrative of steady expansion, while updating the government’s short-term gross domestic product (GDP) outlook in light of stronger-than-expected momentum through 2025.\n\nThe Survey is expected to set out its outlook on growth and employment, with a sharper focus on productivity gains, private capital expenditure and the role of digital technologies – particularly artificial intelligence – in reshaping labour markets and skill requirements.\n\nLast year’s Economic Survey (2024–25) made the case for medium-term structural reforms and projected real GDP growth for FY2025–26 in the range of 6.3 percent to 6.8 percent. The upcoming Survey is expected to review actual economic outturns since then and explain any recalibration of the near-term growth assessment.\n\n2025 signals: Upside to growth\n\nThrough 2025, Chief Economic Adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran repeatedly pointed to the possibility of a stronger growth outcome than earlier estimates, particularly after robust quarterly GDP prints in the second quarter of the fiscal. He indicated that FY2025–26 growth could be “north of 7 percent” and flagged the prospect of India approaching the USD four-trillion economy milestone, citing sustained momentum in manufacturing and services.\n\nGrowth and the numbers:The Survey is expected to lead with a data-driven assessment comparing last year’s projection band of 6.3–6.8 percent with the latest growth indicators. While maintaining a cautious tone, it may reflect an upward bias to the outlook, taking into account recent momentum.\n\nExports amid geopolitical risks:Exports are likely to feature as a key area of concern amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty, supply-chain disruptions and uneven global demand. Last year’s Survey noted that India’s exports of goods and services remained resilient despite global headwinds, but warned that trade is sensitive to conflicts, protectionism and volatility in energy and freight costs. The new Survey is expected to revisit these risks, assess pressures on merchandise exports and highlight the role of services exports, market diversification and free trade agreements in cushioning external shocks.\n\nInvestment and supply-side push:Private capital expenditure and foreign direct investment may be highlighted as central drivers of expansion, alongside policy prescriptions to sustain the investment cycle and ease bottlenecks.\n\nLabour, technology and AI:Building on last year’s special essay on artificial intelligence and employment, the Survey is expected to deepen its analysis of how automation and generative AI are altering labour demand, productivity and skill formation.\n\nClimate and green transition:The document may revisit social indicators and green investment priorities to present a balanced view of growth.\n\nFor markets and ratings agencies, the Economic Survey serves as a comprehensive stock-taking exercise that frames the Union Budget. Any upward shift in the official growth narrative – including an acknowledgement that growth may exceed the earlier 6.8 percent ceiling – will shape expectations around fiscal arithmetic, policy priorities and the broader economic outlook.",

But its domestic auto industry has been among the world's most protected, with the government levying tariffs of between 70% and 110% on imported cars.\n\nPRICIEST EUROPEAN CARS BENEFIT FROM BIGGEST DUTY CUTS\n\nWhile India agreed under the deal to reduce import tariffs on cars above an import price of 15,000 euros ($17,963) to 10% over time, details of how the reductions will be implemented were not disclosed publicly.\n\nA senior Indian government official, however, said New Delhi agreed to immediately reduce import duties on 100,000 traditional internal combustion engine cars annually split between three price categories.\n\nEuropean cars with an import price of 15,000 euros to 35,000 euros will see tariffs reduced to 35%, with annual imports capped at 34,000 units, said the official, who asked not to be named as the deal still requires legal vetting.\n\nCars priced 35,000 euros to 50,000 euros will be charged a 30% duty, with imports limited to 33,000 units a year, the official said. And 33,000 cars priced over 50,000 euros will also be subject to a reduced tariff of 30%.\n\nThe two highest price categories will see the largest tariff reductions. And the cap for all three categories combined will be raised to 160,000 units over 10 years, the official said.\n\nIndia's trade ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the details of the agreement.\n\nMORE INDIANS DEVELOPING A TASTE FOR LUXURY\n\nAt a time when a growing number of Indians are developing a taste for opulence - from expensive homes to watches and even bathroom fittings - luxury cars made up less than 1% of the 4.4 million passenger vehicles sold in the country last year.\n\nWhile executives have said that lower tariffs are unlikely to translate into immediate price cuts, they said the reductions will allow them to bring more vehicles to the market.\n\nLower import taxes should also be a boost for other European automakers such as Volkswagen, Renault and Stellantis, which have said increased trade will also result in increased technology transfer and shared supply chains.\n\nLOCAL EV MANUFACTURERS TO REMAIN PROTECTED FOR NOW\n\nIndia will, meanwhile, also cut import duties to 30% to 35% on a total of 20,000 European-made electric vehicles, the official said, but only five years after the trade deal is implemented.\n\nThose tariff cuts will only apply to EVs priced above 20,000 euros in order to protect domestic players like Tata Motors and Mahindra.\n\nSimilar to combustion engines, the duty on EVs will reduce to 10% over five years and the annual import quota will rise to 90,000 units, the official added.",

        "full_content": "It is not just wine and spirits drinkers who stand to gain from the proposed India–European Union free trade agreement. Pet owners, especially those buying imported dog food, could also see prices ease as tariffs are lowered under the pact.\n\nPremium European brands such as Farmina and Royal Canin are likely to become more affordable once duties are reduced, potentially expanding their footprint in a market where imports are still dominated by Asian suppliers. Currently, the EU accounts for less than 10 percent of India’s pet food market, underscoring the headroom for growth once price barriers come down.\n\nCommerce ministry data show that Thailand has steadily strengthened its dominance in India’s dog and cat food imports, accounting for more than 62 percent of imports in FY25, up from 39 percent in FY18. South Africa and China are other notable suppliers, while the EU’s share has declined sharply over the years, from more than 50 percent in FY18 to about 19.5 percent in FY25. Within Europe, France, Italy and Spain remain the largest suppliers, though their individual shares are well below their earlier peaks.\n\nDespite the EU’s shrinking import share, India’s overall pet food imports have surged as rising incomes, urbanisation, and changing lifestyles fuel pet ownership. Imports of dog and cat food have more than doubled over the past five years and risen sixfold over the past decade, the data show.\n\nIndia imported $72.19 million worth of dog and cat food in the eleven months of 2025, compared with $35.05 million during between January and November 2018. A decade ago, imports during the same period stood at just $11.2 million.\n\nIf tariff reductions under the EU trade deal translate into lower retail prices, European brands could regain market share lost to Asian competitors, while Indian consumers benefit from a wider choice and more competitive pricing in an increasingly crowded pet care market.",

        "full_content": "The Central government will stick to its goal of 4.4 percent fiscal deficit as there is no room for further easing, said professor Mahendra Dev, the chairman of the PM-Economic Affairs Council. However, the government now needs to target its debt-to-GDP ratio, which currently stands at 56.1 percent, he said in an interview.\n\nIn addition, the top economist said the recently concluded India-EU free trade deal will help soften blow from external factors, as New Delhi seeks to cut trade dependence on few countries. The professor also expressed confidence that India will grow at 6.5-7 percent in FY27.\n\nYou have described India EU-FTA as transformative. What are the implications short-term and long-term implications?\n\nThe India-EU FTA is being called as the mother of all deals because 2 billion people and 27 to 28 countries are involved. So, it's a great opportunity for both sides. India will benefit with exports in many labour-intensive commodities like textiles, gems and jewelry and auto parts.\n\nAnd similarly, Europe will benefit from their exports of many commodities to India, including wines and luxury cars. So, it's mutually beneficial for both and part of diversifying exports to other countries. India has sealed several trade deals in the last two years or so. So, I think India is trying to diversify, avoiding dependence on few countries. That’s the strategy.\n\nDoes the India-EU FTA cushion us comfortably against other external pains?\n\nYes, most of it. Of course, in the short term, there may be some problems. For example, textiles and others sectors may get affected. But I think in the next one or two years, we can have more diversified exports. So, in that way, India's growth is not affected due to US tariffs.\n\nSo, what kind of policy interventions will enable our businesses to deal with those regulatory hurdles, especially with CBAM?\n\nAs the finance minister, commerce minister mentioned, it is for all the countries. So, I think that can be probably negotiated. Then we have to be more technology-oriented where carbon emissions can be reduced.\n\nFrom a policy perspective, do you think there is room for more support to MSMEs for easier tech access?\n\nI think the government is already taking a lot of measures for MSMEs. There are three main problems for MSMEs. One is credit, the working capital, particularly, and then technology, they have to adopt technology. And third is marketing. I think government facilitates some of these things. And then, of course, large corporate sector also has to help the MSMEs.\n\nYou have said a weakening rupee is not a structural issue. What can the budget do to address the capital outflows?\n\nWeakening rupee has an impact on imports, particularly because we also import some of the commodities for export purposes, so that cost will increase. But on the other hand, why I said it's a cyclical, not a structural one problem is because it has happened in the last one year or so. One of the issues is that there is uncertainty on the US-India trade deal. So, once I think it's done, that problem will not be there and that's why I said it's a cyclical. Because if you see over time, India's rupee compared to, if you see last five years, the depreciation is not that high. It's only this year that the currency has slipped 6% or so. So, that's why I said it's maybe a question of one year or two years kind of thing. I think the people will come to India. And investments in AI may reduce after some time. So, people will come to India.\n\nWhat do you think are the reasons for the private sector not stepping up investments?\n\nYou need to have growth rate of seven to 8% for that. Right now, we have investment rate of about 30 percent and we need to increase it to around 35 percent. The government has been raising capital expenditure in the last few years to help the private sector. India has been adopting several measures such as GST, ease of compliances and several other steps. This will push the private sector to invest more. Some of the industries said uncertainty is one of the reasons. However, it's the right time to invest because the balance sheets are very good, corporate balance sheets and bank balance sheets, the so called twin balance sheet problem is not there. So, I think this is the right time to invest. But some of the CMIE data shows that there some investments are already happening. So that way, I'm hopeful in the next few years, with these reforms and the government capital expenditure will have multiplier effects on private investment.\n\nIs there a case in the Budget to perhaps look at encouraging consumption through other ways and through other methods?\n\nNo, government has already done some of the reforms through GST and income tax that will increase the consumption and similarly, monetary policy also has done reduction in interest rates. So, all those things will lead to consumption pick up in the next six months.\n\nCan you give your perspective on India's declining debt trajectory. Do you think there's room right now for fiscal easing, or should India stick to its fiscal consolidation?\n\nI think, for fiscal easing there is no room. The government will stick to the goals of 4.4 percent fiscal deficit, although it's not a goal. Now, debt-to-GDP is the goal, which is 56.1 percent for this year. For the next financial year, we have to go to 55 percent, that’s how it will be 50 percent (by FY31). That’s the goal, and the government will achieve it.\n\nIt’s often said that India needs to grow between 7-8 percent, then only we see a cycle change in per capita income…\n\nPer capita income, generally they say, is between Rs 2,500-3,000. For it to double, about Rs 5,000-5,500 or so. I think generally it takes six years to double the per capita income. But in long term, we need to have 7-8 percent growth, and that depends on several sources of growth.\n\nOne is, you know, human capital, skills, education, health, that's the one which we need to focus. Second, is labour intensive manufacturing sector. And third is women participation in workforce. The rates are lower now about 35 percent, world average is 50 percent.\n\nAlso, the structural transformation from agriculture to manufacturing and services is needed. Because India has 46 percent of working population in agriculture, which is 15 percent of GDP. So that unless we shift the workers to manufacturing and services with skills, education and other things, then we can't achieve higher growth.\n\nWe have been missing our divestment targets? Do you think the government has dropped the idea?\n\nI don't think the government has dropped something because they're trying. I think the government is probably trying to divest IDBI Bank. But the government is waiting for the right time…because the markets and all also have to be, suitable for disinvestment. So probably over time, I think they will try to achieve the targets.\n\nYou wrote a piece on PSU IPOs, can you tell us what’s driving the optimism behind?\n\nEarlier, one or two decades back, PSUs faced a lot of losses and Budget had to give protection to them. But now PSUs are having profits. Some may be problematic, but even PSU banks are doing well. So, because of the efficiency improvement in both public enterprises and banks, the people have changed their perception.\n\nBharat Coking Coal went for IPO. I think, it was subscribed 147 times. And similarly, several other public sector enterprises in recent years have got a lot of subscriptions for IPOs. So, I think lot of efficiency improvement has happened in the sector.\n\nWhen we look at, where we are from an economic point of view -- the weakening rupee, you said, is not a structural issue, but a lot of people are hurting. So, in this, how does an average Indian feel optimistic about when it comes to the economy, and what is driving your optimism?\n\nAs I mentioned, the weakening of the rupee is maybe a concern at individual level, sending people abroad or those things…but from the economy point of view, I don't think one should worry because our inflation is low. When the rupee deficits, inflation increases generally. So that is not a worry.\n\nAnd then our growth is also good. So that way, from the macro-economic point of view, it's not a problem. That's why I said it's a cyclical, individual level. Of course, one benefits on loses in this kind of thing on the ease of living.\n\nIf you see the structural reforms in the last 10 years, I think a lot of things have been done, including IBC and then RERA. So, that has improved certain things. But as I kept on saying, states are also important in this journey. They also have to participate at the ground level, efficiency improvement in this. So, my sense why I'm optimistic about India, because the growth rate is higher, and then we have lot of focus.\n\nWe are also paying attention to health, education skills now, which will improve. And then our demographic dividend, which we will have. Because for all the countries, aging is a problem. They're becoming, you know, above 40-50, whereas we still have our median age at 29.",

        "full_content": "It’s one of the most common UPI mistakes, and one of the most stressful. You make a payment, see the success message, and only then realise the money has gone to the wrong UPI ID. The amount may not even be large, but the fear is immediate because UPI moves fast and gives you no obvious way to pull money back.\n\nWhat happens next is far less dramatic than people assume, and often far less reassuring.\n\nWhy a successful UPI payment is hard to undo\n\nUPI transfers are built to be instant and final. Once a transaction shows as successful, the money has already moved from your bank account into someone else’s. Unlike card payments or failed bank transfers, there is no cooling-off window and no automatic reversal. This is the part many users find hard to accept. Even though the payment was a mistake, the bank cannot simply take the money back. Legally and technically, it now sits in the recipient’s account, and any reversal depends on their consent. That design choice is deliberate. UPI prioritises speed and certainty over reversibility. The trade-off is that the responsibility to verify details sits squarely with the sender.\n\nWhat the bank and the app actually do\n\nThe first thing you should do is raise a complaint within the UPI app you used. Every transaction has a dispute or “wrong transfer” option. This doesn’t reverse the money, but it creates a formal trail and triggers communication between banks. Your bank then reaches out to the recipient’s bank, which in turn informs the account holder that money has been credited by mistake and asks whether they are willing to return it. If the recipient agrees, the reversal is processed and the money usually comes back within a few working days.\n\nIf the recipient ignores the request or refuses, the bank’s role becomes limited. Banks cannot\n\ndebit an account without authorisation, even when the credit was accidental. At this point, you may be advised to submit a written complaint or, in some cases, approach the police. That step can help establish pressure, but it does not guarantee recovery.\n\nWhen the money comes back automatically\n\nThere is one situation where users often get lucky. If the UPI ID you entered does not exist at all, the transaction usually fails and the money is automatically returned to your account within a short time. This is why checking whether the transaction was marked “successful” or “failed” matters so much.\n\nOnce it’s successful, however, the outcome depends entirely on the person at the other end.\n\nWhy speed helps, but doesn’t solve everything\n\nRaising a complaint quickly is still important. It increases the chance of contacting the recipient before the money is spent and signals that the transfer was genuinely accidental. But speed does not change the underlying rule. There is no deadline within which banks can force a reversal.\n\nThis is also why UPI fraud cases are harder to resolve than people expect. If money is sent voluntarily, even under deception, recovery is not automatic. Accounts can be flagged or frozen if fraud is proven, but that does not always translate into money coming back.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth about UPI mistakes\n\nThe reason wrong UPI transfers feel so harsh is because the system works so well when things go right. Instant payments leave very little room for human error. The brief moment when the recipient’s name flashes on the screen before you hit confirm is not a formality. It is the only real safeguard you have.\n\nUPI assumes attentiveness, not forgiveness. Once you understand that, the rules make more sense, even if they feel unforgiving.\n\nCan my bank reverse a wrong UPI transfer on its own?\n\nNo. If the transaction is successful, the bank cannot debit the recipient’s account without\n\ntheir consent or a legal order.\n\nHow long does it take to get the money back if the recipient agrees?\n\nUsually a few working days, depending on the banks involved and how quickly the recipient\n\nWhat if the recipient refuses to return the money?\n\nYou can escalate the complaint and, if advised, approach the police, but recovery is not",

        "full_content": "India and European Union (EU) together comprise of 2 billion people, 25% of global GDP and one third of global trade. A free trade deal (FTA) between the two countries marks a giant step for the global economy. While the trade discussions have been happening for nearly two decades, more intense discussions started from 2022 and concluded on January 27, 2026.\n\nGiven the status of India-US trade deal, the India-EU FTA is symbolic in terms of India being able to find other markets for most of the goods that are exported to the US. It should also be viewed considering the global supply chain restructuring initiatives to reduce dependency on China. The deal will put the US on the backfoot and show cases that India will not compromise on access to agriculture and dairy because of the large farmer population which depends on these sectors. Taken positively it shows that India is willing to give access to higher-end products, such as wines, or niche agricultural products, such as kiwis etc. This might be a template along which the India-US trade deal can happen.\n\nAccording to the EU perspective, 96% of goods exported by the EU are going to have reduced or zero tariffs, while the Indian perspective is that 99% of Indian exports will have privileged access.\n\nSeveral Indian sectors are likely to benefit from the FTA. EU imports around $100 billion worth of footwear and leather goods. Currently, India exports around $2.4 billion to the EU in this category. The tariffs will be reduced to zero, from as high as 17%, immediately once the deal is in force. This should support Indian companies gaining larger market share over time. Another sector is marine products (tariffs of upto 26% to be reduced) which opens a market of $53 billion with a current export value of just $1 billion. Gems and jewelry sector currently at $2.7 billion exports to EU will be able to target the $79 billion imports market in the EU.\n\nApparel and textiles is a sector where India could see zero tariffs and access to a $263 billion EU imports market. Currently, India exports $7 billion to the EU. This could be a significant boost to Indian manufacturers in this sector. Plastics and rubber are another EU imports market worth $317 billion of which India currently has a share of only $2.4 billion. Chemicals is another sector worth $500 billion EU imports market where India gets privileged access.\n\nMedical devices including spectacles, lenses and measuring and testing equipment could find a large market. Similarly, engineering goods get access to a $2 trillion market of which current share is only $16. 6 billion.\n\nOn the services side, the IT/ITes, professional services, educational services and R&D and other knowledge-based services will get a boost with predictable visa frameworks to support business development and delivery in the EU. This will also support Indian students to continue post-study work in the EU.\n\nTraditional medicine including Ayurveda is also going to find a large market.\n\nFrom an investment perspective, one should not get too excited and act in haste. There is no reason to start investing in any of these sectors without proper analysis. Of course, the market leaders in these sectors are likely to get the maximum benefit from the privileged market access. One needs to estimate how much gains each company has in terms of revenues from this over the next 3-5 years. This needs to be incorporated in the valuation models and then the revised intrinsic value needs to be compared to the current market prices. Only if the market price is significantly lower than the intrinsic value would it make sense to invest in those companies.\n\nWhat one can definitely focus on is being aware of the sectors or growth vectors which are likely to benefit given the above FTA details. For example, Services and Industries are two growth vectors which get a significant boost from this. A portfolio approach to this growth vector which focuses on the full universe of Services companies and at any given time invests in a select set of companies which are significantly mispriced given the growth opportunity is likely to deliver satisfactory returns over the long-term as the FTA benefits unfold. Similarly, the Industries growth vector would benefit from the access to engineering markets.\n\nWe would suggest a disciplined approach to companies in these sectors following the Scientific Investing Framework as opposed to a knee-jerk reaction to ad-hoc stocks which are touted as beneficiaries of the FTA.",

        "full_content": "The recent conclusion of negotiations on the long-pending India-European Union Free Trade Agreement (FTA) marks a watershed moment in India’s external economic policy, one that could meaningfully reshape trade flows, competitiveness, and investor confidence over the coming decade. After nearly two decades of intermittent talks, the pact was finalised at a summit held in New Delhi, with leaders on both sides hailing it as a significant step towards deeper economic integration between two of the world’s major trading blocs.\n\nEssentially, the deal aims at extensive tariff removal and regulatory harmony in areas of goods, services, and investment. Following its ratification, the agreement is projected to gradually eliminate or significantly reduce duties on over 90 percent of bilateral trade by value, thereby granting Indian exporters access to the EU's largely protected market and, at the same time, raising Indian tariffs on key European products.\n\nThere are several layers of consequences for the Indian industry. On one hand, export sectors like pharmaceuticals, textiles, gems and jewellery, and labour-intensive manufactures are expected to become major beneficiaries of a deeper market access through reduced tariffs and regulatory alignment with EU standards. Some initial rough calculations point to export increases amounting to billions of dollars in categories such as ready-made garments, where preferential treatment, if given, can hold out a great competitive advantage for India against its rivals like Bangladesh and Vietnam.\n\nBesides tariff reductions, the FTA also envisages services trade liberalisation and mobility of skilled professionals, which could further boost India's current large IT, business services, and telecom exports to the EU. To many exporters, this comes as an important non-tariff factor that may help in lowering the barriers that have, for a long time, been associated with the lack of regulatory harmony in services.\n\nOn the import side, a lowering of tariffs on capital goods, intermediate inputs, and high-technology products from Europe, such as machinery, precision instruments, and specialised components, could result in reduced production costs for Indian manufacturers. In time, this cheaper access to quality inputs may lead to a closer integration with the European value chains, increase productivity, and result in more foreign direct investment in the manufacturing and technology sectors.\n\nHowever, the way forward is not without its complications. The implementation will be subject to ratification by the Indian parliament as well as the respective legislative bodies of the EU member states, and full liberalisation is anticipated to be brought in gradually over several years. Meanwhile, there still remain some structural issues: the rigorous EU standards for sanitary, phytosanitary, and environmental compliance might diminish the nominal tariff benefits if Indian exporters do not improve their quality and traceability systems.\n\nBesides, the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), a climate-linked levy on carbon-intensive imports, still remains a sticking point in the overall regulatory landscape. Although not fully settled within the agreement, CBAM could significantly influence the competitiveness of the steel, aluminium, and chemicals sectors, especially small and medium enterprises that are still trying to figure out new compliance regimes.\n\nConsidering these factors, the FTA's effect on investor confidence might even be more significant than its trade provisions. The agreement shows that India is ready to align with the high-standard global trade frameworks and to change its economic partnerships to different ones, especially considering the tariff fight with the United States.\n\nOverall, the India-EU Free Trade Agreement is a reflection of both a great opportunity and a highly challenging task. It may drastically improve the export competitiveness of India, bring the key industrial segments up to date, and help India become an even more important player in global value chains. However, to make the most of these opportunities, the necessary level of domestic reforms, strict adherence to regulatory standards, and continuous diplomatic efforts will be required on both sides as they will have to deal with the complex interaction of trade, climate policy, and strategic economic priorities.",

        "full_content": "Many parents notice that the Aadhaar card issued to small children looks different. It is blue, not white. This is the Blue Aadhaar card, issued to children below the age of five, and it follows a slightly different set of rules.\n\nThe biggest difference is that children under five do not have to give biometric details. No fingerprints or iris scans are taken. Instead, the Aadhaar number is linked to the Aadhaar of one parent or legal guardian. The idea is simple. Biometric details in young children change quickly, and capturing them too early creates problems later.\n\nThe Blue Aadhaar card contains the child’s name, date of birth, gender and Aadhaar number. A photograph of the child is taken at the time of enrolment. The card also carries a reference to the Aadhaar number of the parent who is linked to the child’s record.\n\nParents can apply for a Blue Aadhaar by taking the child to an authorised Aadhaar enrolment centre. One parent must already have Aadhaar. The process is largely the same as adult enrolment, except that biometric details are skipped. The child’s details are entered, the photograph is taken, and the parent’s Aadhaar is used for verification. Once this is done, an Aadhaar number is generated for the child.\n\nThe Aadhaar number issued at this stage is permanent. It does not change as the child grows older. What changes is the information linked to it.\n\nWhen the child turns five, biometric details have to be updated. This includes fingerprints, iris scans and a fresh photograph. The update must be completed before the child turns seven. If this step is missed, Aadhaar-based authentication may stop working until the update is done. This can create problems when Aadhaar is required for school admissions or other official processes.\n\nThere is another mandatory biometric update when the child turns 15. This update is meant to account for physical changes during adolescence. At both stages, the Aadhaar number remains the same. Only the biometric records are updated.\n\nAadhaar is not legally compulsory for children. However, it is increasingly asked for in everyday situations. Schools often ask for it at the time of admission. It is also used for government health schemes, scholarships and bank-related services. Because of this, many parents choose to enrol their children early to avoid complications later.\n\nThe Blue Aadhaar card itself does not expire and does not need to be replaced. Once biometric updates are completed, it automatically functions like a regular Aadhaar card. Parents mainly need to remember the two update stages, at five and at 15.\n\n1. Is the Blue Aadhaar a different kind of Aadhaar?\n\nNo. It is the same Aadhaar system, issued without biometric details for children under five.\n\n2. What happens if biometric details are not updated after age five?\n\nAadhaar authentication may not work until the biometric update is completed.\n\n3. Can Aadhaar be issued soon after birth?\n\nYes. Aadhaar can be issued to newborns as long as one parent has a valid Aadhaar number.",

        "full_content": "Vodafone Ideais not looking at fresh equity infusion at this stage and believes its current funding roadmap, backed by bank loans, promoter support and adjusted gross revenue (AGR) relief, is sufficient to execute its three-year turnaround plan, CEO Abhijit Kishore said, even as the company awaits the outcome of a reassessment of its Rs 87,695 crore AGR dues.\n\nResponding to investor queries, Kishore said the telecom operator is targeting Rs 25,000 crore in bank funding and Rs 10,000 crore in non-funded facilities to support its planned Rs 45,000 crore capital expenditure over the next three years.\n\nWith annual EBITDA of around Rs 9,200 crore, the company’s debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at roughly 2.5x — a level, he said, is manageable for an infrastructure-heavy business.\n\n“We are not looking at equity at this point in time,” Kishore said. “Two years later, we will evaluate how the situation evolves. But today, we believe we have adequate funding through the instruments we have outlined.” He added that both promoters remain committed and engaged in the business.\n\nSpeculation about a potential equity raise or induction of a strategic investor has persisted given Vi’s leverage and upcoming liabilities. However, management indicated that internal cash flow improvement, operational efficiencies and incremental debt will support both network investments and statutory obligations.\n\nA key factor underpinning that confidence is the AGR relief framework under which the company’s dues have been frozen at Rs 87,695 crore as of December 31, 2025, with a staggered, back-ended repayment schedule over 10 years.\n\nAt the same time, a reassessment of AGR dues for the period FY07 to FY19 is underway. “The reassessment has started and is progressing at a very encouraging pace,” Kishore said, declining to provide a timeline or indicate the potential quantum of relief. “We have all the supporting documents and are deeply engaged at multiple levels.”\n\nChief Financial Officer Tejas Mehta said about Rs 80,000 crore of AGR dues are already recognised on the balance sheet, with the balance disclosed as contingent liability in line with the frozen amount. He termed it premature to estimate the outcome of the reassessment.\n\nOn spectrum liabilities, the company made clear it is not seeking any moratorium or deferment from the government. Over the next three years, Vi faces spectrum payment obligations of about Rs 49,000 crore — approximately Rs 7,000 crore in the first year, Rs 15,000 crore in the second and around Rs 27,000 crore in the third.\n\n“We are not seeking any moratorium on spectrum liabilities. That is already built into our cash flow planning,” Kishore said. “Over the next three years, we have spectrum dues of around Rs 49,000 crore, and we are comfortable servicing them.”\n\nManagement said spectrum payments will be met through a combination of improving EBITDA, internal cash generation and planned bank funding. The company has set a target of tripling EBITDA over three years, driven by subscriber stabilisation, customer upgrades and capex-led revenue expansion.\n\n“With EBITDA expansion, operational efficiencies and bank funding, we believe we are in a comfortable position to service both spectrum payments and capex,” Kishore said. “Spectrum payments are part of our committed financial roadmap.”\n\nThe Rs 45,000 crore capex programme — in addition to around Rs 18,000 crore already invested over the past six quarters — will be front-loaded, with higher spending in the first two years to accelerate network rollout and returns. Roughly 70% of the outlay will be directed toward radio access, with the remainder allocated to transport and core network infrastructure.",

        "full_content": "If you don’t know your UAN off the top of your head, that’s completely normal. Most people don’t. It’s not something you use every month, and unless you’ve actively checked your PF online, it probably never mattered — until suddenly it does.\n\nYou try to check your balance or move your PF after changing jobs, and everything grinds to a halt at one question: “Enter your UAN.” Cue frustration.\n\nThe important thing to know is this: your UAN isn’t missing. It already exists. You just need to pull it out of the system once.\n\nWhat the UAN is, in plain terms\n\nYour Universal Account Number is a 12-digit number given by the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation. Think of it as your permanent PF identity.\n\nEvery time you change jobs, your employer opens a new PF account. All those accounts sit under the same UAN. That’s why EPFO keeps asking for it — it’s how they know all those PF balances belong to you.\n\nThe way most people find their UAN (and it usually works)\n\nIf your mobile number is linked to your EPF account, this is the simplest route.\n\nGo to the EPFO member portal and click on “Know your UAN”. Enter your mobile number and the captcha. An OTP comes to your phone.\n\nAfter that, the site asks for one more detail — PAN, Aadhaar, EPF member ID or passport number. You don’t need all of them. Just one that matches their records.\n\nIf everything lines up, your UAN appears on the screen and also comes as an SMS. For many people, this is a five-minute job.\n\nBefore all that, check your salary slip\n\nThis sounds boring, but it’s surprisingly effective.\n\nMany employers print the UAN on salary slips or annual salary statements. Look near the PF deduction line. If you’re still working with the same company, this is often the fastest way — no OTPs, no portals, no patience required.\n\nWhen the EPFO site tests your sanity\n\nSometimes the portal just… doesn’t behave. OTPs don’t arrive. Details don’t match. You get vague error messages that explain nothing.\n\nIf that happens, don’t keep retrying for hours. Just ask your HR or payroll team. They can see your EPF details and tell you your UAN directly. This is especially useful if your account was created years ago and your phone number has changed since then.\n\nThe most common problem: your old mobile number\n\nThis trips up a lot of people.\n\nIf the mobile number linked to your EPF account is no longer active, OTPs won’t reach you. In that case, you’ll first need to update your mobile number, either through the EPFO portal or with help from your employer.\n\nOnce the new number is approved and linked, the UAN lookup usually works smoothly.\n\nOne thing people forget after finding their UAN\n\nJust finding the UAN isn’t enough.\n\nDo this once, and future you will be grateful.\n\nYou don’t need to memorise your UAN. You just need to know how to retrieve it when the moment comes. Once you have it, activate it, save it somewhere safe, and make sure your contact details are up to date.\n\nThat small bit of effort can save you a lot of irritation later — usually at the exact moment you least want it.\n\n1. Is my UAN the same as my PF account number?\n\nNo. PF account numbers change with every job. Your UAN stays the same.\n\n2. Can I end up with two UANs?\n\nYes, it happens sometimes because of employer errors. EPFO allows you to merge them.\n\n3. Do I need Aadhaar to find my UAN?\n\nNot always. But Aadhaar and PAN are needed for withdrawals and online claims.\n\n4. Can I do this without a mobile number?\n\nNot online. OTP verification is mandatory, so you’ll need employer help.\n\n5. Does my UAN stop working if I take a career break?\n\nNo. It stays valid even if you’re not employed for years.",

        "full_content": "Vodafone Idea’s prolonged AGR burden had pushed the telco into a “vicious cycle” of funding constraints, underinvestment and customer losses — but the worst is now behind it, CEO Abhijit Kishore said, unveiling what he called a three-year reset plan aimed at restoring growth and profitability.\n\nFor years, the uncertainty around adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues kept lenders wary, limiting capital access and slowing network expansion. “The AGR overhang meant funding was not available. Without funding, investments and deployments suffered. That hurt network experience, impacted brand perception and led to subscriber losses,” Kishore said during the analyst and investor meeting on January 28. “That has been the cycle we were stuck in.”\n\nThe cycle, he argued, has now been broken by three developments. The first was Vi’s Rs 3,300 crore fundraise through non-convertible debentures (NCDs), secured even before AGR clarity emerged.\n\nThe second was the extension of the contingent liability adjustment mechanism (CLAM) with promoter Vodafone Plc. Originally capped at Rs 8,400 crore for seven years post-merger and expiring in June 2025, the agreement has now been extended until December 31, 2025. Of the remaining Rs 6,400 crore, Rs 2,300 crore will be infused in cash over the next 12 months, while shares worth Rs 328 crore have been earmarked for monetisation.\n\nThe third — and most critical — trigger is the AGR relief framework. Vi’s dues have been frozen at Rs 87,695 crore as of December 31, 2025, with a staggered and back-ended repayment schedule over 10 years. Annual payments will be capped at Rs 124 crore for the first four years, followed by Rs 100 crore annually for the next four, with the reassessed balance payable in six equal instalments between FY36 and FY41.\n\n“This is a definitive, long-term solution with clear visibility on cash flows,” Kishore said, adding that the relief strengthens not just Vi but India’s broader digital infrastructure ecosystem.\n\nWith regulatory uncertainty easing, Kishore declared a “Vi 2.0 reset” and laid out a three-year roadmap built around what he called the “1-2-3” framework: sustained customer additions, double-digit revenue growth and tripling EBITDA.\n\nTo deliver this, Vi will invest Rs 45,000 crore over the next three years — in addition to Rs 18,000 crore already invested over the past six quarters — taking total planned investment to over Rs 60,000 crore in roughly four years.\n\nThe bulk of the new capital will go toward aggressive network expansion. Vi plans to achieve 4G parity with competitors across its 17 priority circles — which contribute over 99% of revenue — within 12 to 24 months. Simultaneously, it will expand 5G coverage across urban markets with populations above 20,000 over the next 12–30 months.\n\nThe company also aims to convert remaining 2G sites to 4G in select circles, expand fixed wireless access (FWA) offerings for home and small-office users, and prepare for satellite communication services through its partnership with AST SpaceMobile, which Kishore expects to materialise over the next 18–24 months.\n\nSince its follow-on public offer (FPO), Vi has already invested Rs 16,000 crore, adding over 100,000 sites, increasing capacity by 43% in key markets and expanding population coverage from 77% to about 86 percent. The company has launched 5G in 43 cities, with Kerala becoming the first fully covered circle.\n\nOperational metrics are showing early signs of improvement. Annual subscriber losses, which had averaged 15–16 million over recent years, have narrowed to 5.3 million so far this year. Excluding a deliberate slowdown in low-quality customer additions in one quarter, net losses were just 1.5 million — a swing of nearly 12 million compared to prior trends.",

        "full_content": "The Government of India, in its last Union Budget, increased the foreign direct investment  (FDI) limit in the insurance sector to 100 percent. This move was a necessary and positive step, strengthening capital availability and reinforcing confidence in the sector’s long-term potential.\n\nAs the Union Budget approaches, expectations are focused less on ownership structures and more on the operating environment that ultimately determines penetration, profitability, and the sector’s contribution to the broader economy.\n\nFrom a market participant’s standpoint, the next phase of insurance growth will be driven not by incremental capital, but by policy choices that improve demand quality and duration of liabilities.\n\nFiscal policy: Signalling matters more than numbers\n\nFrom a fiscal standpoint, insurers are not expecting surprises. What matters is credibility and predictability. The assumption is that the government will continue on a path of gradual consolidation while protecting growth-oriented expenditure, especially capital spending.\n\nFor long-term allocators like insurers, the composition of borrowing is as important as the headline deficit. A predictable issuance calendar, stable maturity distribution, and clarity on the medium-term fiscal glide path are essential for duration management and asset-liability matching. Policy continuity that supports long-term domestic savings also strengthens fiscal outcomes by anchoring demand for government securities and reducing reliance on volatile external flows.\n\nIn this sense, fiscal discipline and insurance sector growth are mutually reinforcing rather than competing objectives.\n\nTax policy shapes risk behaviour\n\nTax policy remains the most powerful behavioural lever for insurance adoption. Insurers are not seeking broad tax concessions. What they are seeking is neutrality. Pure protection products like term life, health insurance, and basic accident cover reduce future economic vulnerability and implicit fiscal risk. A tax regime that does not penalise simplicity would materially improve protection penetration and portfolio quality.\n\nRetirement products present a similar issue. Insurance-based annuities provide guaranteed income streams, yet its tax treatment often compares unfavourably with alternative pension products. When tax outcomes dictate product choice, retirement adequacy suffers. Greater alignment across retirement instruments would allow households to choose based on risk and income needs rather than tax arbitrage.\n\nMicro-insurance needs economic viability\n\nMicro-insurance remains essential for financial inclusion, but its economics are fragile. High transaction costs, compliance overheads, and limited pricing flexibility constrain scale, despite clear social need. The industry is not looking for subsidies. It is looking for enabling conditions like simplified compliance for small-ticket policies, lower frictional costs, and support for digital-first distribution. When micro-insurance becomes viable, it reduces dependence on post-event fiscal support and improves resilience at the household level.\n\nPublic schemes: Scale to sustainability\n\nGovernment-sponsored insurance schemes have expanded coverage rapidly, particularly in health and agriculture. The next phase must focus on sustainability. Claims volatility, pricing discipline, and service delivery remain uneven, creating stress for insurers and contingent fiscal exposure for the state. From an industry perspective, the emphasis now should be on better data, clearer accountability, and smarter risk-sharing rather than further expansion. Improving scheme design is more effective than increasing allocations.\n\nInsurance as a structural buyer of duration\n\nFrom a capital markets perspective, insurance plays a role that is often underappreciated. Growing premium pools translate into long-duration liabilities, which naturally flow into government securities, infrastructure bonds, and high-quality corporate credit.\n\nIn an environment of uncertain global capital flows, insurers act as stable, counter-cyclical investors. Policy stability that supports steady insurance growth indirectly deepens bond markets, smoothens the government borrowing programme, and lowers systemic volatility.\n\nHigher insurance penetration also reduces the likelihood that economic shocks migrate onto the sovereign balance sheet, making insurance an understated but effective tool of fiscal risk management.\n\nCREATING A Strong Insurance Industry Landscape\n\nAlthough GST exemptions on retail life and health insurance have eased costs for policyholders, insurers remain unable to claim input tax credits on critical services such as distribution, customer support, and technology. These unrecoverable expenses elevate operating costs and eventually translate into higher premiums. To address this, the industry is urging the government to introduce a more flexible input credit framework and undertake broader GST rationalization in Budget 2026 to contain cost escalation and make insurance products more affordable.\n\nImproving affordability in rural and social insurance\n\nExpanding insurance coverage in rural markets continues to be constrained by cost sensitivity, particularly for low-premium products. Even modest transaction expenses, such as stamp dut,y can materially raise the final price of these policies. Offering stamp duty exemptions for rural and social sector insurance, similar to the framework used under PMJJBY, would help lower entry costs, enhance affordability, and support deeper penetration in underserved regions.\n\nUpdating outdated tax deductions\n\nSection 80D limits have failed to keep up with rapid medical inflation, with even standard family floater premiums now surpassing the allowable deduction. To offer meaningful relief, these limits must be significantly increased so they more accurately reflect current healthcare costs and provide genuine financial support to policyholders.\n\nFrom an insurer’s standpoint, Budget 2026 is not about higher spending or new incentives. It is about policy consistency, tax neutrality, and regulatory alignment. If these are delivered, insurance can do what it is structurally designed to do—protect households, stabilise the financial system, and convert long-term savings into long-term growth.",

        "full_content": "For most people, the address on their PAN card is an afterthought. You apply for PAN early in life, often using a parent’s house or a temporary address, and then you move on. Years pass. You change cities, rent homes, maybe even buy one. The PAN card address stays exactly where it was.\n\nNothing breaks immediately, so it’s easy to assume it doesn’t matter.\n\nBut PAN is no longer just a tax number you quote once a year. It sits quietly behind almost every financial system now. Bank accounts, investments, KYC checks, tax refunds, notices, all of it runs through PAN records maintained by the Income Tax Department. And somewhere in those records sits an address.\n\nMost people realise this only when something goes wrong. A tax notice goes to an old house. A refund is stuck because some verification didn’t line up. A bank flags a mismatch between PAN and Aadhaar during a routine KYC update and suddenly asks for documents you don’t have handy.\n\nNone of this is dramatic, but all of it is annoying and time-consuming.\n\nIf your Aadhaar already has your current address, updating your PAN address through Aadhaar is one of the simplest clean-ups you can do.\n\nHow to update your PAN address\n\nTo update your PAN address online, go to the official Protean (NSDL) or UTIITSL portal. Select ‘Changes or Corrections in existing PAN Details,’ fill out the form with your details, choose either e-KYC (Aadhaar-based) or document upload and submit your request. You will receive an acknowledgement to track your updated PAN card request. If you do Aadhaar-based KYC, it will get updated in minutes.\n\nAadhaar works as a single source of address for many systems now. It is issued and maintained by the Unique Identification Authority of India, and once PAN is linked to Aadhaar, the tax system is allowed to pull basic details like address directly from it.\n\nWhat this means in practice is that you don’t need to go hunting for electricity bills, rent agreements or bank statements just to change your PAN address. If Aadhaar already shows where you live now, PAN can simply mirror that.\n\nThat’s the key point. PAN does not magically update itself when Aadhaar changes. You have to initiate the update. But when you do, Aadhaar removes most of the friction.\n\nHow the update actually feels in real life\n\nThe process is online. You authenticate using Aadhaar, approve the address fetch, and submit the request. There’s no physical visit and no couriering documents. If everything lines up, the update usually goes through without drama.\n\nOne important thing people miss is this: if your Aadhaar address is outdated, updating PAN first won’t help. PAN will only copy what Aadhaar already has. So Aadhaar needs to be correct before you touch PAN.\n\nWhat does and doesn’t change after the update\n\nYour PAN number never changes. It is permanent. Updating the address does not affect your tax filings, past returns, refunds or assessments. It only changes where official communication is sent and how your identity details appear across linked systems.\n\nYou can choose whether you want a new physical PAN card with the updated address. Many people skip this now and rely on an electronic PAN instead, which is fully valid and avoids delivery problems, especially if you move often.\n\nWhy people usually delay this and regret it later\n\nPAN address updates are rarely done proactively. They’re done in response to a problem. A notice arrives at the wrong place. A bank puts an account on hold until details match. A refund is delayed because something didn’t verify cleanly.\n\nNone of these situations are serious on their own. But they all require follow-ups, emails, uploads and waiting. Updating your PAN address using Aadhaar is one of those boring housekeeping tasks that doesn’t feel urgent, until suddenly it is.\n\nIf you’re someone who moves houses often, especially on rent, keeping Aadhaar as your “main” address and syncing PAN to it is usually the least painful way to stay aligned.\n\n1. Does changing my PAN address affect my tax history or returns?\n\nNo. It does not change past filings, liabilities or refunds. It only updates your address for communication and verification.\n\n2. If I update Aadhaar, does PAN update automatically?\n\nNo. PAN does not update on its own. You have to separately request the address update using Aadhaar.\n\n3. Do I need a new physical PAN card after updating the address?\n\nNo. A digital PAN is equally valid. A physical card is optional.",

HAL would like to lease about 10 to 20 which can be bought from Russia directly in flyaway condition.\n\n“The leasing is a separate track because we buy out the aircraft directly. Manufacturing is setting up the facilities. And, as I said, in three years we will do the roll-out in a semi knock-down condition. Bring all the assemblies, assemble it. That is the target in three years. So, bring in all the facilities, bring in the test equipment and get it going. That is the target for three years,” he said.\n\n“In the next year or so, year and a half, we can get in about 10 aircraft. So, that is the idea that we are bringing in,” he said, adding that he is expecting a demand for over 200 SJ100 aircraft for Indian regional connectivity push.\n\n“We see a good market of upwards of 200 aircraft for this size of India and you know in the local region. So, there is enough market for an aircraft of this size.\n\nThe HAL official said the company would commence production of SJ100 in its existing facilities in the next three-four years.\n\nSunil said the aerospace major is in touch with some companies in GIFT City in Gujarat on leasing issues.\n\nGoing forward, in the next three to four years down the line, the SJ 100 and helicopters are going to become a significant component of the company’s revenues.\n\nHe further said state-owned Pawan Hans Ltd will procure 10 Made-in-India Dhruv New Generation (NG) helicopters from HAL and deploy them for offshore operations of ONGC.\n\nFurther there is an order from BSF for Dhruv NG choppers.\n\nReplying to a query, he said the company clocked Rs 31,000 crore revenues last year and this year it expects 7-8 per cent growth this fiscal.",

        "full_content": "The free trade agreement (FTA) between India and the European Union will be dynamic in nature whose benefits will materialise only if the government and the private sector leverage the opportunities it creates, Ernst & Young (E&Y) chief policy advisor DK Srivastava said on January 28.\n\nA day earlier, India and EU finalised an agreement after talks that stretched over two decades, slashing tariffs on most goods with aim to  boost trade.\n\n“I see tremendous potential in the FTA with the EU. It is going to be dynamic and evolving, which will not happen by itself,” Srivastava toldMoneycontrolin an interaction. “The private sector and the government will have to take advantage of the openings that will become available.”\n\nThe agreement offers India a chance to deepen its integration with European markets. Srivastava said trade agreements by themselves do not guarantee outcomes and must be backed by coordinated policy action, investment decisions and industry preparedness to translate market access into real economic gains.\n\nThe FTA will now go through a multi-stage process before it can be implemented. The final text will undergo what is referred to as “legal scrubbing”. Legal experts on both sides will vet the final text to ensure compliance with domestic and international laws.\n\nIt will also have to be ratified by the European Parliament and individual countries. A process that typically takes a year or more.\n\nAlongside with the trade pact, India and the EU agreed to security and defence partnership and enhanced dialogue on strategic ties.\n\nOne of the areas with significant potential is defence manufacturing, particularly through joint ventures, he said.\n\n“I see tremendous scope, as there is a strategic agreement on defence co-development and co-production. The maximum potential will be in that area,” Srivastava said.\n\nSuch partnerships can help Indian firms scale up manufacturing capabilities and integrate with global markets. “India can initiate a number of joint ventures in all of these areas so that we can access not only our large domestic market but also the EU market and the world market as a whole, and can give the benefit of economies of scale,” Srivastava said.\n\nAccording to him, FTA’s success will depend on how strategically India responds to the opportunities that emerge. “It is an evolving scenario, and it depends on how we play it,” he said.\n\nSrivastava said the Union Budget will play a critical role in determining how effectively India can capitalise on opportunities in sectors that require high upfront investment and are technology-intensive.\n\n“The Union Budget should allocate higher amounts so that co-production and co-development in defence initiatives and advanced technology sectors like artificial intelligence and data centres can be encouraged,” he said.\n\nTechnological capability would be a decisive factor in these sectors. Predictable policy support and adequate budgetary allocations would be essential to crowd in private investment, he said.\n\nOn the 16th Finance Commission, Srivastava said India needs a well-balanced system of fiscal transfers that supports both the Centre and the states over the long term without creating structural stress.\n\n“In the longer term, we look for a system of fiscal transfers so that it leaves both Centre and states’ finances in good financial health,” he said. “Excessive transfers or deficient transfers from the Centre to states are problematic.”\n\nWhile the 16th Finance Commission has completed its work and submitted its report to President Droupadi Murmu, the recommendations will be made public only after being laid before Parliament, a process that will coincide with the presentation of the Budget.\n\n“The Finance Commission is supposed to establish that kind of balance to leave both tiers in suitable fiscal balance,” Srivastava said.\n\n'Justice' to lower-income and mineral-rich states\n\nOn horizontal devolution, Srivastava called for stronger equalisation to address disparities among states. “On the horizontal side, inter-state distribution among states, we look at a system with the content of equalisation in overall transfers so that justice can be done to lower-income states and mineral-rich states that have suffered so far,” he said.\n\nSuch states should also gain from India’s expanding economy, Srivastava said, advocating a more equitable distribution framework that ensures neither the Centre nor the states are fiscally disadvantaged.",

The sharp pickup was driven by a broad-based acceleration across manufacturing, capital goods and infrastructure-linked segments, signalling resilient momentum at the end of the calendar year.\n\nManufacturing output—the largest component of the index—expanded 8.1 percent in December, compared with 8.5 percent in November, underscoring steady factory activity despite global uncertainty. Mining output rose 6.8 percent, while electricity generation grew 6.3 percent, pointing to sustained demand from both industry and households.\n\nCapital goods output increased 8.1 percent, reflecting continued strength in investment demand, even as growth moderated slightly from the double-digit pace seen in November. Infrastructure and construction goods remained a key support, rising 12.1 percent, marking another month of robust expansion linked to public capex and project execution.\n\nConsumer demand also showed improvement. Consumer durables output rose 12.3 percent, indicating stronger spending on discretionary items such as appliances and electronics. Consumer non-durables, which had been volatile for much of the year, expanded 8.3 percent, reversing the weakness seen in several earlier months.\n\nPrimary goods output grew 4.4 percent, while intermediate goods rose 7.5 percent, suggesting improving traction across the supply chain and reduced bottlenecks in manufacturing processes.",

        "full_content": "Most dormant accounts aren’t discovered because someone went looking for them. They surface when a debit card fails, a transfer bounces, or the banking app quietly tells you the account is inactive. It feels serious in the moment, but in most cases it’s just the bank being cautious, not punitive.\n\nA bank account is usually marked dormant when there has been no customer-driven activity for a long time, often two years or more. That means no deposits, no withdrawals, no transfers. Even logging into your app doesn’t always count. Banks follow broad guidelines set by the Reserve Bank of India, mainly to prevent fraud in accounts that appear forgotten.\n\nWhat dormancy does not mean is that your money is stuck or gone. The account is restricted, not frozen. The bank just wants to confirm that the person trying to use it is actually the account holder.\n\nIn practice, reactivation is less about banking and more about identity. For many people, the easiest option is simply going to the branch where the account is held and saying, “This account is dormant, I want to reactivate it.” You’ll usually be asked to fill out a short request form and show basic KYC documents like an ID and address proof. Some banks also ask you to make a small transaction, even a token deposit or withdrawal, just to register activity.\n\nIf your documents are in order, the account often becomes active the same day or within a couple of working days.\n\nSome banks now allow dormant accounts to be reactivated online or through their app, but this depends heavily on how old the account is and whether your KYC details are already complete. If your mobile number is linked and your documents are up to date, the app route can work. If not, the system will push you back to the branch. That’s not the bank being difficult; it’s compliance.\n\nWhere people usually get stuck is KYC. Older accounts often have outdated addresses, missing PAN details, or documents that no longer meet current standards. In those cases, the bank won’t reactivate the account until everything is updated. Once that’s done, the rest tends to move quickly.\n\nAs for charges, banks typically don’t charge a fee just for reactivating a dormant savings account. However, if your account had minimum balance rules and those weren’t met over time, those charges may still exist separately. It’s worth asking about this upfront so there are no surprises later.\n\nReactivation timelines are usually short. If nothing needs fixing, it can be done immediately or within a day or two. If documents need updating, it might take a bit longer, but it’s rarely a long-drawn process.\n\nCharges and minimum balance — one practical example can be added. We could briefly note that reactivation itself is free, but penalty charges may reduce the balance if the account was below minimum.\n\nA few things people often worry about unnecessarily: yes, your money continues to earn interest even when the account is dormant. Yes, you can choose to close the account instead of reactivating it if you no longer need it. And no, dormancy is not the same as an account freeze, which usually involves legal or regulatory issues.\n\nThe simplest way to avoid this happening again is to keep the account lightly active. One small transaction every so often is usually enough.\n\nIn the end, a dormant account is really just the bank saying it hasn’t heard from you in a while. Once you show up and say, “Yes, this is still my account,” things usually fall back into place with far less drama than people expect.\n\n1. Will I lose my money if my bank account becomes dormant?\n\nNo. Your money stays safe in the account and continues to earn interest as per the account rules. Dormant just means transactions are restricted until the bank verifies your identity.\n\n2. Can I reactivate a dormant account without visiting the branch?\n\nSometimes. If your KYC details are already up to date and your mobile number is linked, some banks allow reactivation through their app or internet banking. Older accounts usually still need a branch visit.\n\n3. How long does reactivation usually take?\n\nIf your documents are in order, it can happen the same day or within a couple of working days. Delays usually happen only when KYC details need updating.",

        "full_content": "The rupee’s slide over the past few months has turned the external sector into a key macro risk just as the government prepares for Budget 2026. With capital flows turning volatile, foreign investors pulling money out of Indian equities and global uncertainty weighing on emerging market currencies, economists say the Budget will be closely watched for signals on how India plans to shore up investor confidence, attract foreign capital and maintain fiscal credibility.\n\nThe rupee has weakened significantly in recent months, moving from around 86 to nearly 92 against the US dollar, driven by a mix of external and domestic pressures. These include delays in the India-US trade deal, sustained foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows, heavy dollar demand from importers and relatively limited intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The currency is currently trading near 91.73 to the dollar.\n\nEconomists point out that the depreciation is no longer just a currency story but a reflection of stress in India’s balance of payments. Gaura Sengupta, an economist at IDFC First Bank, said the capital account turned negative in the third quarter of FY26, amplifying pressure on the rupee.\n\n“The depreciation pressure on the rupee reflects the BoP deficit, with the capital account turning negative in Q3 FY26. The Budget is expected to focus on measures to support capital inflows,” Sengupta said.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Budget 2026 is expected to place renewed emphasis on attracting stable foreign capital. Measures such as enhancing foreign direct investment (FDI) limits in select sectors and offering tax incentives to overseas investors are likely to be considered.\n\nEconomists also expect the government to double down on its investment-led growth strategy through higher on-budget capital expenditure and policies aimed at crowding in private investment.\n\nSupport for exports is another area likely to gain prominence. With global demand remaining uneven, the government may announce targeted measures to diversify export markets for both merchandise and services, reducing dependence on a narrow set of geographies and improving resilience to external shocks.\n\nTax policy could also play a role in calming volatile portfolio flows. Madhavankutty G, group chief economist at Canara Bank said changes in withholding taxes and capital gains tax could help ease concerns among foreign investors and slow FII outflows.\n\n“Some changes in the tax structure, especially on withholding taxes and capital gains tax, can be expected to alleviate concerns on FII outflows,” Madhavankutty said.\n\nAt the same time, global investors will be watching the Budget for reassurance on fiscal discipline. Madhavankutty expects the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to reaffirm the government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation while retaining flexibility to support growth when she presents the Budget on February 1. A clearly articulated medium-term fiscal roadmap, including the debt-to-GDP trajectory, could be crucial in anchoring investor confidence at a time when the rupee and capital flows are under strain.",

        "full_content": "Public Provident Fund is one of the few long-term savings options where interest is calculated monthly but credited annually. That small detail creates an opportunity most investors miss. The government calculates PPF interest based on the lowest balance in your account between the 5th day and the last day of every month. If your contribution reflects in the account on or before the 5th, it earns interest for the entire month. If it comes in on the 6th or later, you lose that month’s interest completely.\n\nIn simple terms, the calendar date of your investment matters just as much as the amount.\n\nThe “extra month” interest trick explained\n\nThe trick is straightforward. Make your PPF contribution on or before the 5th of the month, ideally on the 1st. When you do this, your money earns interest for that full month. Delay it by even one day beyond the 5th, and that same money starts earning interest only from the next month.\n\nOver one year, this can mean earning interest for 12 months instead of 11. Over the full 15-year PPF tenure, the difference becomes meaningful, especially for those investing the maximum allowed amount.\n\nHow much difference does this actually make?\n\nAt today’s PPF interest rate, losing one month of interest on a large annual contribution may not feel dramatic in year one. But compounding works quietly. Over long periods, consistently investing before the 5th can add tens of thousands of rupees more to your maturity value, without any extra risk or effort.\n\nThis benefit is highest for investors who deposit a lump sum once a year. If you invest monthly, the same rule applies to every deposit, making timing even more important.\n\nThe safest approach is to set a personal rule to invest on the 1st of the month or immediately after the new financial year begins in April. Many banks take one or two working days to credit PPF deposits, so cutting it close to the 5th can backfire. Online transfers usually reflect faster, but even then, allowing a buffer is smart.\n\nIf you invest once a year, doing it in early April ensures you get interest for all 12 months of the financial year. If you invest monthly, treat the 1st as your fixed investment date.\n\nPPF is not about quick wins. It rewards consistency and patience. This timing rule does not change your risk, lock-in, or tax status. It simply ensures that your money works for you for the maximum possible time, every single month.\n\nOver a long horizon, small habits like this separate average returns from optimal ones.\n\n1. Is it enough to deposit before the 5th, or must it be on the 1st?\n\nAny deposit credited on or before the 5th qualifies for that month’s interest. Investing on the 1st is recommended only to avoid delays in bank processing.\n\n2. If I invest monthly, does this rule apply to every month?\n\nYes. Each monthly contribution earns interest only if it is credited before the 5th of that month. Miss the date, and that deposit earns interest from the following month.\n\n3. Does this strategy change my PPF maturity date or lock-in period?\n\nNo. Your PPF maturity and lock-in remain exactly the same. This strategy only affects how much interest you earn along the way, not the account rules.",

        "full_content": "PNB Housing Finance has no plans to exit corporate lending and the recent reduction in the loan book was part of a broader revamp of the business, managing director and CEO Ajai Kumar Shukla has said.\n\nThe company has now in place the required structure, leadership and sourcing teams, with plans to grow the segment's share of its total loan book to 8–10 percent within the next three years even as retail lending will continue to dominate the portfolio, Shukla told Moneycontrol in an interview.Edited excerpts:\n\nA fraud account was reported recently, though it was written off in FY23. Why the delay?\n\nAn account turning NPA (non-performing asset) does not automatically qualify as fraud. After the account was written off with 100 percent provisioning, a detailed forensic and due diligence process was undertaken. During this process, certain unfulfilled commitments came to light, following which the board decided to classify it as fraud in line with good governance practices.\n\nHave the regulator been informed and what action is being taken?\n\nYes, the fraud has been reported to the NHB (National Housing Bank) within the stipulated timeline. Legal proceedings are ongoing and remedial actions are in progress. The builder is also exploring options such as bringing in a partner or a buyout to resolve the matter.\n\nDespite a strong overall retail performance, affordable housing disbursements declined 15 percent YoY to Rs 786 crore in the December quarter? Why did this happen when prime and emerging segments are growing?\n\nThe decline in affordable disbursements was largely due to challenges in certain southern markets, particularly Tamil Nadu, following a government ordinance that temporarily disrupted activity. As a precautionary measure, the company adopted a wait-and-watch approach. The issue has since been clarified by the government and the management believes the market is now well placed for a revival.\n\nHow will disbursements shape up now that the issue has been resolved?\n\nThe fourth quarter is traditionally stronger for the industry and the company is already seeing month-on-month improvement. January disbursements are in line with expectations and the management expects the remaining two months of the quarter to be even better.\n\nCorporate loan assets have reduced sharply to Rs 272 crore, down 78 percent. Can we expect corporateloansto go to zero?\n\nNo, corporate loans will not go to zero. The reduction was a conscious strategic decision as the company revamped its corporate finance business. The structure, leadership,and sourcing teams are now in place, and business growth has resumed.\n\nIn the current calendar year, some momentum will be visible, translating into around 3-4 percent of the book by (the end of) FY26. FY27 will see further acceleration, with corporate loans rising to around 6-7 percent. Over the next two-three years, the corporate loan book is expected to stabilise at around 8-10 percent of the total portfolio, with retail forming the remaining 90 percent.\n\nWith pressure on NIMs across the sector due to rate cuts, how is the company planning to protect margins?\n\nThe company’s NIM stands at around 3.63 percent, within its guided range of 3.6-3.7 percent, which it continues to maintain. The strategy focuses on increasing the share of affordable, emerging, and construction finance businesses, which offer better yields and help sustain margins.\n\nManagement believes there is limited scope for further rate cuts. However, if a cut does occur, the benefit may be partially passed on by banks and institutions. Any impact on margins would be offset by higher-yielding segments like prime, emerging, and construction finance. The company aims to maintain NIMs in the 3.6-3.7 percent range even in that scenario.\n\nCapital adequacy has declined sequentially. Is there any plan to raise capital?\n\nThe company remains well-capitalised and does not see any need for raising capital in the near term.\n\nBorrowing costs have reduced sharply. What has driven this improvement?\n\nThe reduction is mainly due to better-negotiated term loans, benefits from repo-linked and MCLR-linked lending and refinancing through NHB at subsidised rates. Continuous churning from higher-cost to lower-cost borrowings has also helped bring down the blended cost.\n\nThe borrowing pattern is expected to remain largely the same in the near term, with adjustments depending on the interest rate trajectory in the next financial year.\n\nGross NPAs in the affordable segment have risen to 0.66 percent. Should this be a concern?\n\nWhile GNPA has edged up, it remains among the best in the industry and well within the company’s guidance. The increase was partly due to temporary disruptions in southern markets. Asset quality has since stabilised, with minimal difference between Q2 and Q3 figures, and management does not see any major concern.",

        "full_content": "Gold and silver ETFs surged up to 5 percent on January 28, mirroring the sharp rise in precious metals. Analysts have commented on whether it is time to take money out of equity markets and increase exposure to precious metals.\n\nElevated valuations in several markets, particularly in the AI and tech sectors, along with concerns about rising debt and earnings sustainability, mean equities are facing tighter conditions than they have in recent years, said Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead, VT Markets.\n\nWhat makes gold and silver so attractive?\n\nThe analyst further said that alongside this, Indian markets are facing the impact of wider macro issues with slowing growth signals, persistent geopolitical risk, and uncertainty around the path of interest rates. All of this combined makes gold and silver more attractive as defensive assets for investors, he said.\n\n\"Gold and silver also continue to look attractive. With real yields showing signs of peaking and central banks maintaining strong gold purchases, precious metals are benefiting from their role as stores of value. Silver adds an additional layer, given its industrial demand tied to energy transition and electronics,\" Maxwell said.\n\nThe rally is fueled by a perfect storm of factors heightened geopolitical risks which includes Middle East tensions and tariff threats under US policy shifts, said Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza. “This has positioned precious metals as a classic safe haven play,” he added.\n\nWhile safe-haven demand and industrial catalysts remain supportive, experts caution that this is not the optimal entry point for fresh allocations.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the decision should not be driven by recent price movements, but by how these assets behave and where they fit in a long term portfolio, said Subhendu Harichandan, Executive Director, Anand Rathi Wealth.\n\nFor investors, a lot will depend on portfolio objectives, time horizons and balance, Maxwell said. Gradually reallocating a portion of equity gains into gold or silver ETFs can help hedge downside risks, inflation surprises and policy missteps, according to the analyst. “However, making a more substantial shift away from equities assumes a sharp correction that is not yet clearly established yet,” he added.\n\nSiddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara, said that although gold and silver ETFs are surging to fresh lifetime highs, it would be premature for investors to shift a large part of equity capital to precious metals at these levels.\n\n“During times of volatility, metals serve as excellent portfolio diversifiers and thus, perform well but in the long run, equities are the main contributors to wealth creation. Therefore, a balanced strategy, first of all, maintaining a core equity exposure and then, gradually adding gold and silver through small, phased purchasing on bottoming, helps one stay on the right side of risk management and one's long, term plans as opposed to just following the recent peaks,” he said.\n\nChasing the recent velocity of gains risks buying at near-term peaks, while patience and strategic rebalancing will serve long-term goals better, according to the analyst. With gold and silver prices witnessing a sharp surge, investors in precious metals may consider booking partial profits at current levels rather than making fresh allocations, said Swapnil Aggarwal, Director, VSRK Capital.\n\nTiwari from Bonanza has highlighted different investment strategy for different kinds of investors:\n\nInvestors who don’t have any exposure to precious metals:These investors should consider gradually adding 5-10 percent via ETFs to hedge against ongoing uncertainty, inflation, or dollar weakness.\n\nInvestors who are heavily invested in equity markets:A partial rebalance by trimming overperforming stocks to fund metals allocation can improve risk adjusted returns without abandoning growth potential.\n\nCautious investors:If you are concerned about near term froth, you should monitor for corrections strong rallies often see healthy pullbacks before resuming. Avoid leverage or over concentration, the analyst said.\n\nDiversification remains the timeless principle. Equities offer long term compounding tied to corporate earnings, while precious metals provide insurance against systemic risks, Tiwari added.\n\nAjit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking, concluded by saying that gold and silver are not substitutes for equities - they are portfolio stabilisers. “With equities still driven by earnings growth and metals acting as a hedge against global uncertainty, currency volatility, and geopolitical risks, the right approach is not switching, but rebalancing. Investors should maintain a diversified asset mix across equities, debt, and precious metals, using metals as a strategic allocation rather than a tactical trade,” he said.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "Donald Trump did not set out to make the world more cooperative. Yet, paradoxically, his tariff tantrums have done precisely that.\n\nBy turning trade into a weapon-slapping duties, tearing up arrangements, and threatening allies as casually as rivals, the US has pushed the rest of the world to look for insurance.\n\nNew trade corridors are being stitched together, deals fast-tracked, and old negotiations dusted off. The newly signed India-EU agreement must be read squarely in this context.\n\nThis isurvashee shapam upakaram—a curse that turns into a blessing.\n\nTrump’s America-first economics has forced both India and Europe to hedge against US unpredictability. For Brussels, India offers scale, growth, and a democratic counterweight in a fragmented world.\n\nFor New Delhi, Europe provides market depth, technology, capital, and—crucially —diversification away from overdependence on any one bloc. The deal is less about romance and more about realism.\n\nAfter nearly two decades of on-again, off-again talks, speed itself tells a story. What was earlier bogged down by disagreements over tariffs, data, labour standards and sustainability was suddenly propelled by geopolitical urgency.\n\nEurope wants to reduce its exposure to US trade volatility and Chinese supply chains. India wants stable access to high-value markets at a time when global trade rules are becoming messier, not clearer.\n\nOn paper, the agreement looks impressive. Tariff reductions across a wide range of goods, better access for Indian services, investment facilitation, and deeper regulatory cooperation could all materially improve India’s export profile.\n\nEngineering goods, textiles, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and IT-enabled services stand to gain. For an economy that still struggles to break into global manufacturing value chains, Europe’s market—large, affluent and rules-based—offers a genuine opportunity.\n\nBut trade deals are won or lost not in summit photographs, but in execution. And this is where caution is warranted.\n\nSome of the clauses that Europe considers non-negotiable—particularly around climate and sustainability—can easily turn into hidden trade barriers.\n\nCarbon taxes, border adjustment mechanisms and stringent compliance norms may sound virtuous, but they risk penalising Indian exporters who operate in a very different cost and energy ecosystem. If carbon pricing becomes an indirect tariff, the promised market access could quickly narrow.\n\nThere is also the question of regulatory asymmetry. European firms are adept at navigating complex compliance regimes; Indian MSMEs are not.\n\nWithout serious domestic hand-holding — on standards, certification, logistics and finance — the benefits of the deal could accrue disproportionately to large firms, leaving smaller exporters squeezed out. Trade liberalisation without trade preparedness is a familiar Indian story, and not a happy one.\n\nThen there is timing. Europe’s own economy is slowing, grappling with energy transitions, political fragmentation and demographic headwinds.\n\nDemand growth may not be as robust as headline trade projections suggest. India, meanwhile, must ensure that it does not open sensitive sectors prematurely or concede policy space that it may need as its manufacturing ambitions evolve.\n\nNone of this negates the strategic value of the deal. In a world where the US is unreliable and China is assertive, India-EU cooperation makes geopolitical sense. It signals that India can still strike large, complex agreements without being boxed into binary choices. It also reinforces India’s claim to being a serious player in shaping post-US-centric trade architecture.\n\nYet optimism must be tempered with realism. Trump’s tariffs may have nudged the world towards each other, but they have not made trade easier — only more political.\n\nThe India-EU deal is an opportunity born out of disruption, not stability. Whether it becomes a growth engine or a missed chance will depend on how deftly India manages the fine print, supports its exporters, and negotiates future disputes.\n\nFor now, the curse has yielded a blessing. Whether that blessing endures will only be known with time.\n\nThe devil, of course, lies in the details.\n\nInvesting insights from our research teamEU-India FTA: Sectoral shake-up – Who gains, who loses?India–EU FTA: Not much impact on India’s mass passenger vehicle marketAsian Paints Q3 – Volume improves; pricing remains constrainedBruised but Not Broken: Stocks worth a bet amid the market weaknessMarico Q3 FY26: In-line performance, multiple growth triggersTata Consumer Q3 FY26: Growth businesses continue to deliverDCB Bank Q3 FY26: Earnings momentum builds, re-rating still has legsWhat else are we reading?Budget Snapshot | Why time is now the biggest creditor riskTrade as Strategy: Why the India–EU FTA belongs to today’s age of geoeconomicsWhy Japan’s yen intervention could rattle global marketsBig realty firms Q3 results show some cracks in luxury home salesCan BJP break Mamata's grip on Bengal in 2026?Physical or electronic bullion, where does the money lie?Investors bet on ‘hot’ US economy heading into mid-term elections(republished from the FT)Why the India–EU Trade deal finally happened and what it says about coercive trade practicesUnion Budget must spell out measures to strengthen corporate earnings growth, vital to bringing back FPIs and re-energizing the marketWhy this ‘Indian bear market’ should worry us a bitBudget 2026–27 calls for a stronger state-led capex pushIndia’s True Two-Front Battle: America and ChinaUnion Budget ideas to transform India’s citiesHow to win allies and get rich at the same timeBudget 2026 and the MSME Growth Agenda: Reducing compliance burden and enabling scaleMarketsBudget 2026 Playbook: 5 triggers that could ignite a post-Budget market rallyTech and StartupsBudget 2026: Food delivery ecosystem pushes for tax relief as costs pressure mounts on restaurants\n\nTechnical Picks: RECLTD, NLCINDIA, NMDC, ONGC, BEL\n\nDinesh Unnikrishnan Moneycontrol Pro",

The strong momentum pushed the Nifty India Defence index up by around 5 percent during the session.\n\nKey factors behind the sharp rise in defence shares\n\n1) India-EU defence pact:India and the European Union on Tuesday concluded a defence and security agreement aimed at enhancing cooperation in areas such as counter-terrorism, the Indo-Pacific and joint development of military hardware. The pact was finalised at the India-EU summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and European Council President Antonio Costa.\n\nOfficials said the agreement would improve interoperability in the defence sector and create opportunities for Indian companies to participate in the EU’s Security Action for Europe (SAFE) programme, supporting long-term growth prospects for domestic defence manufacturers.\n\n2) Rub-off from BEL rally:Shares ofBELjumped 10 percent to a record high of Rs 457.50 after the firm reported a 20.4 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit for the December quarter, while revenue from operations increased nearly 24 percent.\n\nBEL, which is also a constituent of the Nifty 50 index, saw heavy buying interest, triggering a spillover effect across other defence stocks.\n\n3) Pre-Budget rally:The rally also comes ahead of the Union Budget scheduled for February 1. The Nifty India Defence index gained about 5 percent amid expectations that the government may announce a meaningful increase in capital expenditure for the defence sector, according to brokerage firms.\n\nThe index extended gains for a second straight day and has risen more than 8 percent over the past two sessions.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "If you’ve opened an account without visiting a branch, signed documents digitally, and managed everything from your phone, you’ve already brushed up against what neo banks are trying to do. They’re not trying to replace banks altogether. They’re trying to remove the friction people associate with banking.\n\nIn the Indian context, most neo banks are not banks in the legal sense. They don’t have their own banking licence. Instead, they operate on top of an existing, regulated bank. Your money sits with that partner bank. The neo bank provides the app, the interface, and the features you use day to day.\n\nThink of it as a modern front desk built in front of a very traditional back office. The rules, compliance, and custody of funds remain old-school. The experience is what’s new.\n\nWhat you can actually do with a neo bank\n\nFor everyday use, neo banks cover most basics. You can open a savings account, get a debit card, receive salary credits, make UPI payments, transfer money, and pay bills. Where they feel different is in how clearly and quickly things happen.\n\nTransactions show up instantly. Spending is grouped automatically. You can freeze or unfreeze your card, change limits, or switch international usage on and off from the app itself. There’s less chasing customer care and more control in your own hands.\n\nSome neo banks focus on specific needs rather than everyone. Niyo, for instance, found early users among travellers and students by making foreign spending simpler and more transparent.\n\nDo they giveloansor credit cards\n\nUsually, no, at least not directly. When a neo bank offers a credit card, overdraft, or loan, it typically comes from a partner bank or NBFC. The neo bank handles the digital experience. The actual lender decides who qualifies, at what rate, and reports the loan to credit bureaus.\n\nFrom the user’s point of view, it feels smoother. From a risk and regulation point of view, it’s still traditional lending underneath.\n\nIs your money safe This is where clarity matters. In India, the money in a neo bank-linked account is held by a licensed bank regulated by the Reserve Bank of India. The neo bank itself doesn’t hold deposits.\n\nIf a neo bank shuts down or pivots, your account doesn’t vanish. It continues with the partner bank. Still, it’s worth knowing which bank that is before you sign up, instead of treating all fintech apps as the same.\n\nNeo banks work best for people who are comfortable doing everything on their phone and don’t need branch access. Freelancers, gig workers, young professionals, and frequent travellers often find them easier to live with than traditional bank apps. They are also useful for people who want a clearer picture of where their money goes without having to manually track it.\n\nWhere traditional banks still matter\n\nFor big-ticket loans, business credit, or situations where you want face-to-face problem-solving, traditional banks still dominate. Neo banks aren’t built for that depth. They’re designed to make routine banking feel less painful, not to handle every financial need.\n\nNeo banks provide speed and convenience, but they have limitations. Mostly, they do not possess their own banking licence and rely on partner banks for deposits and credit. Customer support is often only available online, product offerings are limited, and account continuity may be disrupted if partnerships end, leading to uncertainty for long-term users.\n\nNeo banks aren’t a revolution. They’re a layer. They sit on top of the existing banking system and make daily money management smoother and more transparent. For most people, they work best alongside a traditional bank, not instead of one.",

        "full_content": "Sterlite Technologies has flagged a fresh supply-chain risk from China even as demand improves, primarily driven by North American telecom fibre rollouts and data centre buildouts.\n\nThe company warned that restricted exports of germanium, vital for optical fibre manufacturing, from China, which accounts for around 80 percent of the global supply, could add to cost pressures, alongside American tariffs.\n\nSterlite Technologies chief executive officer Ankit Agarwal told Moneycontrol, “Availability of germanium will be a risk factor for us, which we are looking to mitigate.”\n\nThe company is evaluating alternative sourcing options in Europe, the US and other geographies amid a broader global push to secure critical mineral supply chains.\n\nAgarwal said the company expects improved margins but it would depend on two or three factors, including mitigate or reducing the impact of US tariffs, which remain significant, and availability of germanium.\n\n“More than 70–80 percent of germanium supply comes from China and sourcing is currently a challenge due to restrictions,” he said.\n\nGermanium is a key input in optical fibre manufacturing, used to raise the refractive index of the fibre core and enable efficient, low-loss signal transmission.\n\nHigh-purity germanium dioxide is added during production to improve telecom and data centre performance.\n\nChinese curbs can directly impact fibre production costs and supply chains.\n\nAgarwal said rare earth self-sufficiency is becoming a policy priority globally, including in India.\n\nThe caution on raw materials comes even as STL narrowed quarterly loss and reported higher EBITDA for the December quarter , supported by improving demand in North America and growing traction in the data centre and enterprise segment.\n\nAgarwal said STL remains focused on the US and Europe, where fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) expansion, 5G deployments and accelerating data centre capital expenditure are driving demand.\n\nBeyond hyperscaler investments, fibre requirements within and between data centres are also growing.\n\nThe company secured nearly Rs 500 crore in orders from the data centre and enterprise segment, with the order book improving sequentially. This segment now contributes about 20 percent to revenue and is expected to rise to 30 percent over the next 12–18 months, the company said.\n\nMargins, however, remain under pressure from US tariffs. While reported EBITDA margins are currently around 11–12 percent, Agarwal said they would have been closer to 19–20 percent in the absence of tariffs.\n\nSTL is targeting utilisation levels above 70 percent, which it believes can sustainably generate 20 percent EBITDA margins.\n\nTo cushion the tariff impact, STL is optimising output at its US cable facility while continuing to serve the market through both domestic and global operations.\n\nRevenue contribution from the US increased to nearly 36 percent from about 25 percent last year, with both volumes and revenue rising. Agarwal expressed hope that an interim India–US bilateral trade agreement could provide relief.\n\nOn broader market trends, North America is leading the recovery in global fibre demand, driven by telecom and data centre investments. Europe remains stable but is expected to accelerate data centre build-outs amid supportive regulations.\n\nIn India, BharatNet investments are expected to provide medium-term visibility, while the domestic data centre market, currently around 1.5 gigawatts, could expand to 7–8 gigawatts by 2030, creating incremental demand for fiber infrastructure. Fibre-to-the-home and fibre-to-enterprise deployments are also expected to remain strong.\n\nWhile recent data centre interconnect (DCI) wins have largely come from North American telecom customers, Agarwal said global hyperscaler investments in Europe and Asia could translate into similar opportunities over time, though near-term growth remains concentrated in the US.\n\nAt home, he expects all three private telecom operators, including Vodafone Idea, following clarity on adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, to continue investing in fibre networks to support 5G rollouts, FTTH expansion and data centre connectivity.",

The surge, which mirrored international markets, is driven by escalating geopolitical concerns, US tariff threats, a weakening rupee, robust industrial demand and strong speculative interest.\n\nThe India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA) pegged the metal's price at Rs 3,61,821 per kilogram at 12:30 pm, up 5.64 percent from the previous day's close at Rs 3,42,507 per kilogram on January 27.\n\nOn the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), silver futures surged to a new peak of Rs 3,82,479, and continued to hover at Rs 3,78,813, representing 6.32 percent increase from the previous close.\n\nIn the international market, Comex spot silver was trading above $114 per ounce, which is a 8.32 percent gain from the previous close.\n\nMeanwhile, the rupee was trading at 91.62 against the US dollar, up 0.19 percent from its previous close. A weak rupee has made imports and commodities more expensive.\n\nHere is how a kilogram of silver has moved.\n\nThe Augmont Bullion, published on January 27, said silver surged past the $115 mark, driven primarily by a sharp weakening of the US dollar and rising policy uncertainty.\n\n\"The dollar slipping to a four-year low, combined with slumping US consumer confidence and concerns over the labour market, has strengthened the case for defensive assets,\" the report stated.\n\nAdded to this, tariff threats and perceived pressure on Fed independence have amplified geopolitical and policy risk premiums—firmly underpinning gold and silver prices.\n\nThe report said that silver is resuming higher towards $120 (Rs 3,90,000). Key support is seen at $103 (Rs 3,40,000); a break could lead to retracement towards $100 and $97.",

        "full_content": "As the Union Budget 2026 draws closer, taxpayers are expecting the government to prioritise easing TDS norms, simplifying compliance, and strengthening dispute resolution frameworks, instead of rolling out major policy changes.\n\nRethinking the need for TDS requirements\n\nThere is a demand for reducing TDS for people in the lower and middle-income groups. For many taxpayers, the current system creates unnecessary paperwork and cash flow problems. “With current TDS rates ranging from 10 percent to 30 percent, TDS significantly reduces cash flow for both salaried workers and entrepreneurs. Faster refunds must be introduced immediately; taxpayers currently experience a 6-12 month waiting period before receiving their refund, causing billions of rupees in lost capital. said Karthik Narayan, Vice President (Tax & Transition), Stellar Innovations.\n\n“AI technology should be utilised to allow Refund Payments to be processed within 30 days, and taxpayers should be able to file Form 16 in a simplified manner. The threshold for TDS exemption should also be raised to Rs 5,00,000,” Narayan said.\n\nTax professionals say Budget 2026 could make a meaningful difference without resorting to headline-grabbing tax cuts.\n\nAnkit Rajgarhia, Designate Partner at Bahuguna Law Associates, says the focus should be on certainty rather than frequent changes to rates or slabs. “What is needed is a simplified withholding framework with fewer rates and clearer rules,” he says. Faster dispute resolution and administrative remedies to address long-pending litigation would also ease pressure on the system, he adds. For salaried taxpayers, Rajgarhia believes clearer provisions and a stronger standard deduction within the new tax system would provide targeted relief.\n\nRefund delays remain another persistent concern. Despite improvements in automation, refunds are still held up over minor mismatches between employer filings, bank-reported data and annual information statements. In many cases, these discrepancies have little bearing on actual tax liability but still trigger verification checks that slow processing.\n\nFor households managing EMIs, education expenses and regular investments, refunds are not incidental. Excess tax deducted during the year represents money that could have been deployed elsewhere. With most income data already available digitally, taxpayers argue that refund timelines should be shorter and more predictable.\n\nThe impact of conservative withholding is not limited to individuals. Businesses, particularly in sectors with tight cash cycles, also feel the strain. Multiple layers of tax deduction on payments to vendors and service providers can lock up working capital and increase compliance overheads.\n\nSubham Kalindi, a senior executive at a renewable energy company, says high upfront deductions affect liquidity at both the individual and project level. “When cash is locked away because of conservative withholding, it creates stress across the value chain,” he says. “Using real-time income visibility more effectively can reduce this pressure without weakening revenue collection.”\n\nWhile individual taxpayers are focused on cash flow and refunds, investors are watching Budget 2026 for stability rather than fresh tax tinkering. Ravi Singh, Chief Research Officer at Master Capital Services, does not expect further changes to capital gains taxation this year. According to him, long-term investors have already adjusted to recent revisions, and predictability now matters more than incremental concessions.\n\nAcross income groups, the message is consistent. Taxpayers are asking for a system that deducts more accurately during the year and returns excess amounts without friction.\n\nIf the simplified tax system is meant to make compliance easier, many believe that promise should extend beyond filing day.",

        "full_content": "Zoho has entered the enterprise resource planning (ERP) market, taking on global giants such as SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft in a space long dominated by legacy players.\n\nThe company is launching its ERP platform first in India, positioning it as a more integrated, affordable, and user-friendly alternative for businesses.\n\nAt the same time, Zoho has announced the expansion of its presence in Kumbakonam with a new campus that can eventually accommodate up to 2,000 employees, strengthening its hub-and-spoke model and its focus on rural development through technology.\n\nExplaining the thinking behind this move, founder and chief scientist Sridhar Vembu says legacy ERP companies are “bloated, expensive and greedy,” echoing what customers themselves feel.\n\nThat critique shapes Zoho’s ambition to build simpler, customizable, and India-first products.\n\nIn this conversation with Moneycontrol, Vembu speaks about Zoho’s ERP strategy, the Kumbakonam expansion, plans for north India, semiconductor design, navigating the AI wave, and why patience and long-term product thinking remain central to Zoho’s approach.\n\nWhy does Zoho believe it can challenge legacy ERP players?\n\nERP is competitive, but Zoho knows how to compete. We have proven that on a global scale. What I like about this market is that we are facing legacy players like SAP and Oracle who are bloated, expensive, greedy, and just money-grubbing. Customers themselves say these things. We want to directly attack that with a much better value proposition that is more user-friendly, customizable, and ready to go.\n\nWhy launch ERP in India first?\n\nIndia is not an afterthought for us. For SAP or Oracle, India is an afterthought. For us, it is our first market. That is why our ERP is tailored for India from the beginning and deeply integrated with India’s DPI stack, including banking, payments, and e-commerce.\n\nWhat makes Zoho’s ERP different?\n\nIt is much more user-friendly and much more integrated. Nobody does e-commerce well in the ERP space. We do. It becomes a kind of digital nervous system for the enterprise. It is more customizable and much more affordable.\n\nHow big is the ERP opportunity?\n\nGlobally, it is at least a $253 billion market, bigger than CRM. We have built this system over 17 years with all the subsystems. We are the only player that comprehensively covers all aspects of ERP. We expect to take a decent and fair share of the market, though I cannot predict exact numbers.\n\nWhat does today’s Kumbakonam announcement mean to you personally?\n\nThis is my native region. People often think I am from Tenkasi, but I was actually born not far from here. So it is a particularly special moment for us.\n\nWhat are Zoho’s plans for Kumbakonam?\n\nWe already have about 250 people spread across two offices here. We want to invest and grow in this region just like we have done in Tenkasi. Most of our investments are going into rural parts, and this region is a key part of that push. We think of it as rural development through research and development.\n\nHow many jobs can the new campus support?\n\nWe have about 250 people now and want to grow that to around 2,000. That is what the campus is built for. How fast we reach that depends entirely on how the products grow.\n\nHow is this similar to your hub-and-spoke model?\n\nIt is very similar to what we pioneered in Tenkasi. We plan schools, and we may eventually run our own K-12 school under NAOS. We may run clinics. We invest in rural communities, like restoring ponds. We encourage employees to participate in community activities. We are not here just to build software. We also want to be part of the holistic development of the region.\n\nHow do you see the talent pool in Kumbakonam?\n\nThe talent situation is good all over India. Kumbakonam is special because this is the land of Srinivasa Ramanujan. There is strong mathematical and software talent here. We invest heavily in training and in nurturing this talent.\n\nWhat are the timelines for scaling this campus?\n\nThat depends on product adoption and global growth. We do not try to predict exact timelines. But the campus is built so that we can scale up to ten times in terms of talent pool.\n\nWatch the video interview: Small town, Big tech: Sridhar Vembu on Zoho’s rural push, AI Bubble, SaaS consolidation & many more\n\nWhat is Zoho’s right to win in ERP?\n\nOur value proposition is simple. We are more affordable, more customizable, and much more user-friendly. We are deeply integrated with our own ecosystem. And India is our first market, not an afterthought. That is why we believe we can win.\n\nAre you still planning expansion in north India?\n\nYes. We paused for about a year or a year and a half because we had to navigate the AI shift. We did not want to distract ourselves. Now we feel more confident. This year, we will have some announcement from Uttar Pradesh.\n\nWhat is happening with your semiconductor plans?\n\nWe are investing in semiconductor design. We have put the fab plan on hold for now because of our focus on AI. We will revisit it in a couple of years. We have too many things going on right now.\n\nDo you think there is an AI bubble?\n\nThere is definitely a bubble component. A company raised $2 billion at a $12 billion valuation with no product, just based on the founders’ resumes. Now people are leaving and there is still no product. That tells you everything. AI is real, but you can over-invest and waste a lot of money. That will happen in AI too.\n\nHow is Zoho approaching AI differently?\n\nWe are both AI-boosting our business and AI-proofing our business. We are confident we will survive and prosper. Just like SaaS came back to reality and Zoho was one of the winners, we hope to navigate AI in the same way.\n\nShould India build massive foundational models like the US?\n\nThere are three problems. First, India is limited to around 50,000 GPUs, while the major players have millions. Second, GPUs are extremely expensive. Third, the power requirement is enormous. Each GPU uses 500 to 700 watts, and they are talking about gigawatt-scale data centres. We cannot blindly copy the US. We have to be smarter and more patient.\n\nThere has been some talk about a slowdown in Arattai’s growth. How do you see its progress?\n\nPace is not the most important thing for us. What matters is consistency and seriousness in execution. The team has been working continuously on Arattai, even during holidays, and that shows their commitment. It is doing well, and we are steadily improving the product. We are focused on building it the right way rather than rushing for quick milestones.\n\nWhat can we expect from Zoho this year?\n\nThere will be many product launches. We have a strong pipeline. More importantly, we are combining everything into a powerful platform. Our “operating system for business” is becoming much stronger, with deeper AI integration and our own models, not just API wrappers.\n\nConsolidation will continue. There are too many companies. Many are buying growth through marketing and struggling to make profits. There will be fewer players, and we hope to be one of the winners.\n\nHow would you sum up Zoho’s approach today? And what would be your budget expectations?\n\nWe focus on patience, long-term product building, and strong R&D. We have navigated major technology shifts before, and we will do it again. My only ask from the budget is that it should focus on R&D and accelerate R&D investments in India.",

        "full_content": "Most people don’t think about their PPO number when they retire. In fact, many don’t even know they have one. It usually comes up only when something doesn’t work the way it should. A pension gets delayed. A bank asks for a number you can’t find. A life certificate doesn’t go through.\n\nThat number they’re asking for is the Pension Payment Order, or PPO.\n\nOnce you retire under the Employees’ Pension Scheme, your monthly pension runs on this number. It’s how the system knows who you are, how much pension you’re entitled to, and where the money should go. As long as your pension keeps coming on time, you may never need to look it up. But the moment there’s a hiccup, the PPO becomes important.\n\nThe PPO is issued when your pension claim is processed by the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation. Earlier, pensioners were often given a physical PPO booklet. Many older retirees still have one lying in a cupboard somewhere. These days, PPOs are mostly digital, which is why many people don’t realise a number has been generated at all. Also, the PPO continue for family pension, and is it still used after the pensioner’s death.\n\nUnlike your Provident Fund account number or Universal Account number, the PPO only matters after retirement. It stays with you for life. Even if you change banks or move to another city, the PPO does not change.\n\nPeople usually need the PPO number for things that sound routine but quickly turn stressful without it. Submitting a life certificate. Changing the bank where the pension is credited. Checking why a pension hasn’t come in one month. Raising a complaint. Banks and EPFO offices almost always ask for the PPO first.\n\nIf you don’t know your PPO number, there are a few practical ways to find it.\n\nOne way is through the EPFO pensioner portal, where pension-related details can be viewed once you log in with the required information. Another option many retirees find easier is the UMANG App. The app brings multiple government services together. Under EPFO pension services, you can retrieve PPO details after verification. For people comfortable using a smartphone, this often turns out to be the quickest route.\n\nYour bank is another reliable source. If your pension is already being credited, the bank has your PPO number on file. Sometimes it appears on pension slips or annual pension statements. A visit to the pension desk at your branch can usually sort it out.\n\nSome retirees also find their PPO number in old paperwork from the time they retired, such as pension sanction letters or correspondence from EPFO. It’s worth checking before assuming the number is lost.\n\nThere’s often confusion between PPO numbers, PF account numbers and UANs. They serve different purposes. The PF number and UAN are linked to your working years and provident fund contributions. Even after retirement, they may be needed for PF withdrawals or service history. The PPO is different. It is used only for pension. Monthly pension payments are tracked through the PPO, not the UAN.\n\nKeeping your PPO number written down somewhere accessible can save a lot of back-and-forth later. Most pension-related issues are easier to resolve once that number is available. As more services move online, quoting the correct PPO has become unavoidable.\n\nFor many retirees, the PPO only matters when something goes wrong. Knowing where to find it makes those situations far less stressful.\n\n1. Is the PPO number the same as my UAN or PF account number?\n\nNo. UAN and PF account numbers relate to your employment and provident fund. PPO is issued after retirement and is used only for pension payments.\n\n2. Will my PPO number change if I change banks?\n\nNo. The PPO number remains the same for life. Only the bank account linked to it can be changed.\n\n3. What if I can’t find my PPO number online or in old papers?\n\nYour pension-disbursing bank or the EPFO pension office can usually retrieve it using basic identity and bank details.",

        "full_content": "With Budget 2026 around the corner, expectations are building around a possible increase in tax exemptions for senior citizens. Hopes are mounting for the expansion of National Pension System (NPS) tax benefits and a comprehensive scheme covering in-home care for the elderly.\n\nFocus on higher exemption limits\n\n“Senior citizens hope that Budget 2026-27 will offer a more simplified and beneficial tax structure, focusing on higher income exemption limits, increased health insurance deductions, and streamlined compliance to offset inflation,” said Rajarshi Dasgupta, executive director (Tax), Aquilaw.\n\nThough there are various deductions available for Indian residents above 60 years of age under the Income Tax Act, analysts say the exemption limit should be raised to provide much-needed relief for senior taxpayers.\n\nFor instance, Section 80TTB allows resident senior citizens (60-80 years) under the old tax regime to avail of a deduction of up to Rs 50,000 on interest earned from savings and fixed deposits. Tax analysts hope for Budget 2026 to enhance the deduction limit for senior citizens.\n\nOther key demands include increasing tax exemption limits for medical treatment of critical illnesses under Section 80D for senior citizens, and under Section 80DDB for treatment of critical and chronic illnesses, along with streamlining TDS and TCS to reduce compliance hurdles.\n\n“An upward revision of exemption thresholds, coupled with simplified slab structures, would provide much-needed relief to pensioners and retirees dependent on fixed incomes,” said Kunal Savani, partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.\n\nTax analysts say many senior citizens have passive income in the form of capital gains but such profits earned from capital gains aren’t eligible for a tax rebate under Section 87A.\n\n“Given the current scenario of rebate under section 87A, one can expect the government specifically spell out its allowance to senior citizens to avail the rebate on such capital gains, which provides the much-needed relief to such senior taxpayers,” Savani said.\n\nHopes are also building for enhanced pension participation through the National Pension System (NPS), which offers significant tax benefits via deductions under Section 80CCD under both old and new tax regimes.\n\n“Extending tax benefits on NPS contributions under the new tax regime to both salaried and self-employed individuals will help encourage long-term, disciplined retirement savings,” PB Fintech's retirement planning arm Pensionbazaar head Vishwajeet Goel said.\n\nPB Fintec joint group CEO Sarbvir Singh said there is an urgent need for sustained, long-term pension savings and retirement preparedness is emerging as a critical pillar of India’s financial ecosystem.\n\n“The Budget 2026 can encourage disciplined retirement savings by extending NPS tax benefits to both salaried and self-employed individuals. Also, delinking employer participation from the employee’s tax benefit will allow voluntary contributions up to the defined threshold,” Sing said.\n\nComprehensive scheme covering the in-home care\n\nOptimism is growing that the Budget 2026 will establish a comprehensive scheme of benefits covering in-home care, assisted living support and transitional care facilities for senior citizens.\n\nAnalysts argue that the biggest cost pressure seniors face is not hospitalisation but prolonged home-based care such as attendants, nursing, physiotherapy and assisted living support, which runs for years and is almost entirely out-of-pocket.\n\n“Budget 2026 can realistically ease this by recognising certified home-care and long-term care expenses as core health costs with a separate, high-limit tax deduction for seniors and their children, instead of forcing families to absorb these recurring costs without any fiscal relief,” said Raheel Patel, partner, Gandhi Law Associates.",

We reiterate our BUY rating on the stock, citing undemanding valuations, with a TP of INR2,750.\n\nCurrently, INMART is trading at an undemanding valuation, in our view, as the valuations reflect uncertainties surrounding the churn rate, product-market fit, and subscriber growth.

        "full_content": "The Aditya Birla Group plans to invest around $6 billion over the next five years to expand aluminium and copper upstream capacities in India, Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said. This marks the Group’s pivot back to primary metals as economic and industry conditions turn favourable, with group firm Hindalco Industries expected to anchor the investment cycle.\n\nKM Birla outlined the investment plan in his annual reflections note for 2025-26, where he said the Group is moving ‘decisively once again’ to scale upstream capacity after a prolonged phase of downstream-led capital allocation. The expansion plan is expected to reinforce Hindalco’s position as an integrated metals producer, with a strong footprint across aluminium and copper value chains.\n\nWhy Aditya Birla Group is returning to upstream metals\n\nThe renewed focus on upstream investments comes after a deliberate strategic shift in the previous cycle. In 2018, Hindalco had completed a major upstream expansion just as global aluminium markets came under pressure from Chinese overcapacity, while rising input costs -- particularly coal -- compressed margins. In that environment, further upstream expansion made limited economic sense, said Birla.\n\nAlso read|Vodafone Idea’s turnaround moment has arrived after AGR clarity: Kumar Mangalam Birla\n\nAs a result, Hindalco redirected capital towards building downstream capabilities, investing steadily over the following five years in value-added products that require closer customer collaboration and a different operating model from commodity metal production. That phase resulted in what the Group now describes as the deepest downstream metals capabilities in India.\n\nAccording to Birla, the context has since changed materially. China’s decision to cap primary aluminium production has helped stabilise global prices, while improved access to critical raw materials has enabled Hindalco to strengthen its cost structure. Together, these shifts have reopened the economic case for large-scale upstream investments.\n\nBirla emphasised that the decision reflects the need for strategy to remain responsive to changing conditions, rather than being bound by past choices. He cautioned against equating consistency with rigidity, adding that capital must be deployed where opportunity and economics align. “Strategy does not define the business; the business context defines strategy,” Birla said, noting that staying close to data and operating realities is essential to avoiding strategic dogma.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

BFS growth was slightly volatile due to ongoing transition of business head and partly on account of furloughs. The management was confident to derive growth within BFS and TTH on the back of 2 large wins in BFS out of the 6 large deal wins in Q3. The cumulative large deal wins in 9MFY26 stood at 16 vs 14 deals reported for the full year FY25. The order intake was robust at USD1.6b for 9MFY26 (+21% YoY), even the NTM executable order book stands healthy at USD1.7b (+26% YoY). We believe the cumulative large wins, strong revenue conversion and elevated order intake setting up solid foundation for organic USD growth of 17%/14% in FY27E/FY28E. On margins, the numbers were largely in line, while the company re-iterated to keep a tight band at ~14% operating level.\n\nWe are passing on Q3 revenue beat, revising our FY26 organic revenue to ~25% (24.5% earlier).

During the quarter, persistent dispatch delays led to a build-up of inventory in large packages and impacted revenue recognition. However, improved procurement efficiencies supported margin expansion. The management has guided for Rs18-18.5bn revenue in FY26, supported by expected inventory liquidation by Q4FY26. Tezcatlipoca continues to be a key growth driver, with plans underway to double its manufacturing capacity. Refrigeration is expected to account for the lion’s share of revenue going forward, led by new product introductions and consumption-driven demand from end-industries such as F&B, dairy and pharma, while O&G is yet to witness a meaningful recovery, despite a modest uptick in order finalizations during the quarter. We revise our FY26/27E EPS estimates by -4.2%/-1.9%, considering the ongoing slowdown in inventory clearances.

        "full_content": "For a lot of people, State Bank of India is the first place they think of for a personal loan. Not because it promises instant money, but because it feels solid. SBI doesn’t rush you or flatter you. It simply checks whether you fit, and if you do, the loan happens.\n\nThe first real decision isn’t about interest rates or tenure. It’s much simpler: do you want to do this online by yourself, or do you want to sit across a desk and talk it through?\n\nWhat SBI means by a “personal loan”\n\nSBI doesn’t lump everyone together, and that’s actually helpful.\n\nIf you’re salaried and your salary comes in regularly, you’re usually looked at under salary-linkedloanslike Xpress Credit. If you’re a government employee, in defence services, or a pensioner, you’re in a different category and often get slightly better terms. If you’re self-employed, you can still apply — just be prepared for more questions and more documents.\n\nIn all cases, it’s an unsecured loan. No property, no gold, no guarantees.\n\nApplying online: Best when your life is simple on paper\n\nIf you already have an SBI account and your KYC is up to date, applying online is usually the smoothest experience.\n\nYou go to SBI’s loan site, choose thepersonal loanoption that fits you, and fill in the basics — income, employer, how much you want, how long you want to repay. If you’re an existing customer, a lot of this may already be filled in.\n\nYou upload your documents, wait for digital checks, and if nothing looks unusual, approval often comes in a couple of working days. Sometimes sooner.\n\nOnce you accept the loan offer, the money is credited straight to your account. No visits, no follow-ups, no awkward phone calls.\n\nGoing to the branch: Slower, but reassuring for many people\n\nPlenty of people still prefer going to the branch, especially if this is their first personal loan or their income doesn’t fit neatly into boxes.\n\nAt the branch, a loan officer explains what you’re eligible for, helps you fill the form, and tells you upfront if something might be an issue. You hand over physical copies of documents and let them handle the rest.\n\nIt can take a bit longer, yes. But you also don’t sit at home wondering whether your application is stuck somewhere in the system.\n\nDocuments: Nothing exotic, just don’t let them clash\n\nNo matter how you apply, the document list is fairly standard.\n\nAadhaar and PAN are usually enough for identity and address. Salaried people need recent salary slips and bank statements. Self-employed applicants need income tax returns and business documents.\n\nWhat really matters is that details match across papers. When names, addresses and income numbers line up, everything moves faster.\n\nInterest rates, without the marketing gloss\n\nSBI doesn’t give everyone the same interest rate.\n\nWhat you get depends on your credit score, how steady your income looks, where you work, and which loan bucket you fall into. Broadly, rates start in the low double digits and go up if the bank feels there’s more risk.\n\nThe final rate is shown before you accept the loan. That’s the number that will decide your EMI every month, so it’s worth actually reading it instead of clicking through.\n\nHow much you can borrow and how long you’ll repay\n\nYour loan amount depends on how much you earn and how many EMIs you already have running. SBI usually gives a few years to repay, with fixed EMIs from day one.\n\nMost people aren’t asked for a guarantor. That usually comes up only if the profile is borderline.\n\nThings people usually realise only later\n\nSBI asks questions. Job gaps, frequent switches, uneven income — all of these can trigger follow-ups. That doesn’t mean rejection. It just means SBI likes to be sure.\n\nAlso, don’t ignore the prepayment and foreclosure clauses. Some SBI loans let you close early with little or no penalty after a point. Others don’t. If you think you might repay early, this matters more than shaving off 0.25 percent on interest.\n\nAn SBI personal loan isn’t about speed or hype. It’s about certainty. If your income is steady and your paperwork is clean, the loan usually goes through. The only real question is whether you want to do it quietly online, or talk it out with someone at the branch.\n\n1. Is applying online actually faster?\n\nUsually, yes — if your profile is clean and KYC is done.\n\n2. Does SBI need a very high credit score?\n\nThere’s no official cut-off. Higher scores help, lower scores mean more scrutiny.\n\n3. How long does it take to get the money?\n\nFor straightforward cases, a few working days after approval.\n\n4. Do I need an SBI account already?\n\nNo, but having one makes everything smoother.\n\n5. Can I repay the loan early?\n\nYes, but check the fine print before signing.",

        "full_content": "From lower tax rates to new exemptions, expectations tend to run high ahead of every Budget. This year, however, corporate leaders expect continuity and not change.\n\nAccording to a Moneycontrol-Deloitte CXO survey, which gathered responses from 45 senior executives across sectors, no such changes are expected in the Budget for the financial year 2026-28. The pre-Budget survey shows that 84.4 percent of the respondents do not expect the government to announce any new personal income tax, including levies such as estate duty.\n\nOnly 15.6 percent of those surveyed believe the government may introduce a new personal income tax measure. This suggests that most senior executives are preparing for continuity in the personal tax framework rather than factoring in new interventions. The response pattern indicates that expectations of major changes to personal taxation remain limited at this stage.\n\nThe survey also shows that this preference for no new taxes goes hand in hand witha broader desire for stability in personal income tax rates.\n\nAn estate duty is a tax levied on the total value of a person’s property at the time of their death. The tax became payable when the assets of the deceased were transferred to legal heirs. In India, estate duty rates once went as high as 85 percent before the law was abolished in 1985.\n\nIndia does not levy estate duty. However, over the years, references in government documents and policy discussions have periodically triggered speculation about its possible reintroduction. As with previous Budget seasons, there is renewed discussion ahead of this year’s Budget as well, although there has been no official confirmation of any proposal to bring the tax back.\n\nIf reintroduced, estate duty could potentially add to government revenues. However, based on responses captured in the study, expectations of such a move remain limited among senior corporate leaders.\n\nThe survey was conducted by Moneycontrol and Deloitte between December 2025 and January 2026. The survey included CXOs from across industries such as banking and insurance, manufacturing, transport and logistics, energy, life sciences and health, telecom and tech and e-commerce.",

        "full_content": "Axis Bank’s sharp rally, following its Q3FY26 earnings, has once again altered the pecking order among India’s top private lenders, reviving a valuation battle with Kotak Mahindra Bank that has surfaced only sporadically over the past decade.\n\nOn January 27, 2026, Axis Bank shares surged about 5 percent, climbing to fresh multi-month highs. Kotak Mahindra Bank, by contrast, endured a weaker session the same day, with its shares falling over 4 percent after it reported quarterly numbers that were largely in line with expectations but failed to excite investors.\n\nThe rally helped propel Axis Bank past Kotak Mahindra Bank in market capitalisation, a crossover that has occurred only a handful of times in recent history and was last seen in April 2024, and before that in September 2016.\n\nBloomberg data around January 27 showed that Axis Bank is valued at roughly Rs 4.1 lakh crore, marginally above Kotak’s Rs 4 lakh crore. While the gap remained narrow and volatile, the symbolic crossover underscored how quickly investor preferences can shift on earnings delivery.\n\nMomentum extends into January 28\n\nOn January 28, Axis Bank’s stock continued its positive momentum, rising approximately 3.1 percent and was trading around Rs 1,352 on the NSE at 10:30 am.\n\nKotak Mahindra Bank, meanwhile, was relatively subdued, with its shares trading around Rs 1,505, up about Rs 1.50 or 0.37 percent, significantly underperforming Axis Bank.\n\nAxis Bank’s stock climbed as high as Rs 1,325.60 on January 27, extending gains amid heavy volumes after the bank reported a standalone net profit of Rs 6,490 crore, up year on year (YoY), supported by a 5 percent rise in net interest income (NII) to Rs 14,287 crore.\n\nThe earnings beat triggered a flurry of positive analyst responses.\n\nAccording to analyst reports from IIFL and Motilal Oswal, despite margin pressures seen across the sector due to higher funding costs, Axis managed to hold its net interest margin (NIM) at 3.64 percent, reassuring investors about its balance-sheet resilience.\n\nCiti upgraded Axis Bank to ‘Buy’ and raised its price target to Rs 1,463, citing strong core earnings momentum and improving return ratios, while Bernstein reiterated an Outperform rating with a Rs 1,480 target.\n\nMoreover, according to consensus data on Bloomberg, nearly 44 out of 50 analysts tracking the stock now recommend a Buy, marking a clear shift from the more mixed buy-hold stance that has prevailed since early 2022.\n\nAnalysts pointed to Axis Bank’s consistent execution, steady loan growth and controlled credit costs as reasons for the re-rating.\n\nKotak, on the other hand, posted a 5 percent YoY rise in NII to Rs 7,565 crore, while standalone net profit grew a modest 4 percent to Rs 3,446 crore. Margins remained healthy at 4.54 percent, among the best in the sector, but higher operating expenses, particularly employee costs linked to the implementation of the new Labour Code, weighed on profitability and investor sentiment.\n\nValuation has also emerged as a sticking point for Kotak.\n\nAt current levels, the bank trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of about 21–22, significantly higher than Axis Bank’s 15-16 times, a premium that some brokerages such as IIFL and Motilal Oswal have questioned amid slower earnings momentum.\n\nThe January 2026 crossover, however, is not the first time Axis Bank has overtaken Kotak in market value.\n\nA similar episode played out in April 2024, when Axis replaced Kotak as one of India’s most valued private lenders after Kotak’s stock plunged following regulatory action by the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nAt the time, the RBI had restricted Kotak from onboarding customers digitally and issuing credit cards, citing repeated failures to address serious deficiencies in its IT systems. Kotak shares fell as much as 11 percent in a single session, eroding nearly Rs 40,000 crore in market value and dragging its market capitalisation down to about Rs 3.3 lakh crore, while Axis stood around Rs 3.5 lakh crore.\n\nThat 2024 episode was significant not just for the ranking shift but also for its historical resonance.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg data, the last time Axis Bank was valued higher than Kotak Mahindra Bank before 2024 was in September 2016, nearly eight years earlier. The rout in Kotak’s stock at that time resulted in an estimated $1.2-billion erosion in the wealth of founder Uday Kotak, who holds about 25.9 percent stake in the bank.\n\nMid-sized bank battle intensifies\n\nThe renewed Axis–Kotak crossover in January 2026 comes against the backdrop of a broader recovery in the Indian banking sector.\n\nCredit growth has remained firm, asset quality has continued to improve, and balance sheets are far healthier than in previous cycles, an analyst told Moneycontrol.\n\nHowever, the analyst added that banks are also grappling with rising funding costs, intense competition for deposits and the need to repriceloanscarefully to protect margins.\n\n\"In this environment, earnings consistency and execution have become critical differentiators,\" the analyst said.\n\nThe current market-cap tussle also reflects a broader theme playing out in the Indian banking landscape, with the intensifying battle for supremacy in the mid-sized bank segment.\n\nWhile the pecking order at the top, led by HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, has remained largely stable, competition below that tier has been fluid.\n\nAccording to a Moneycontrol analysis, Kotak has consolidated its position among mid-sized lenders over the years, but the renewed challenge from Axis highlights how leadership in this segment remains contingent on earnings execution.",

        "full_content": "India Inc is turning optimistic about the growth outlook despite lingering global risks and policy uncertainty, according to the latest Moneycontrol-Deloitte pre-Budget Survey of about 50 CXOs.\n\nNearly one in five respondents in the pre-Budget survey expect India’s economy to grow above 7 percent in FY27, a sharp improvement from last year when only a small fraction of corporate leaders were extremely optimistic about growth.\n\nIn the current survey, 19.6 percent of CXOs said they were “extremely optimistic”, while another 50 percent expect GDP growth in the 6.5–7 percent range.\n\nThe share of pessimistic respondents has also dropped sharply. Only 6.5 percent of CXOs now expect growth to slip below 6 percent, compared with 15.6 percent in the previous year’s survey, pointing to improving confidence in the domestic macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe government expect the Indian economy to grow 7.3 percent this fiscal year compared with 6.5 percent projected at the start of the year.\n\nThe World Bank and IMF now estimate the economy will grow around 6.5 percent next fiscal year.\n\nPhysical and digital infrastructure, a young and skilled workforce, and innovation and R&D factors were the primary drivers of growth over the next three years, according to CXOs.\n\nConfidence is also visible in investment intentions. A significant proportion of companies plan to increase capital expenditure, technology upgrades and AI integration over the next 12 months, while hiring and R&D spending are expected to remain broadly supportive. Physical and digital infrastructure, manufacturing push and FTAs were cited as key drivers that could support India’s growth over the next three years.\n\nThat said, risks remain firmly on the radar. Geopolitical conflicts and trade fragmentation were ranked as the biggest global threats to business, followed by concerns over a global economic slowdown and cybersecurity risks. On the domestic front, policy uncertainty and slow reforms emerged as the top concern, ahead of infrastructure constraints and delays in trade agreements.\n\nIndia, on January 27, announced the finalisation of a trade deal with the European Union, one of the eight signed in recent times.\n\nCXOs also flagged rising protectionism, volatile capital flows and energy price shocks as medium-term risks that could weigh on growth momentum if global conditions worsen.\n\nMore than 83 percent noted that the Budget should try to address these constraints, a fact also mentioned in the economists survey conducted by Moneycontrol last week.\n\nOn the domestic front, there were uncertainties with regard to labour codes as well, with 35 percent respondents expecting costs to weigh on benefits from compliance simplification and another 17 percent unclear of the impact of newly notified codes.\n\nOn the investment front, CXOs again highlighted the need for simpler tax regimes, single-window clearances, and faster disposal of judicial cases as factors that could help attract investment.\n\nThe outlook appears bright on the interest rate side as well, with over two-thirds of respondents expecting the central bank to cut rates in FY27. The Reserve Bank of India has cut rates by 125 basis points since the start of 2025, bringing the policy rate to 5.25 percent.\n\nOver half of the respondents were confident in policymakers controlling inflation below the RBI’s target rate of 4 percent. India’s inflation is likely to average around 2 percent this fiscal, with the IMF projecting 4 percent inflation in the coming fiscal.\n\nLong-term policy reforms needed on AI\n\nThe CXOs highlighted the need to create a comprehensive long-term policy framework and promote and support R&D for India to become a semiconductor technology hub.\n\nOver 53 percent of respondents expect significant disruption emanating from AI adoption.",

As part of the divestment, ABB IN incorporated ABB Robotics India Private Limited (“INRBT”) as a wholly owned subsidiary and proposes to transfer its Robotics business to INRBT on a slump-sale basis for a consideration of Rs15.7bn. ABB IN then will sell its entire stake in INRBT to ARSAG. The transaction is expected to be completed by 27 February 2026. In our view, the deal is value-accretive for ABB IN, implied at ~2.2x EV/TTM sales and ~24.4x EV/TTM EBIT (inc. other income). The divestment is likely to sharpen the company’s focus on its core portfolio and support at least 10-15bps improvement in EBIT margins in CY26E and CY27E. Additionally, the exit should marginally enhance return ratios, driven by the elimination of negative net capital employed in the Robotics business.\n\nThe stock is currently trading at a PE of 53.3x/45.9x on CY26/27E. We have a ‘Accumulate’ rating on the stock valuing it at a multiple of 56x Sep’27E (same as earlier) arriving at a TP of Rs5,540 (same as earlier).\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Analysts have suggested what allotted investors should do.\n\nThe shares of the Bengaluru-based technology-led logistics solutions provider listed at 112.60 apiece on NSE, marking a discount of 9.19 percent over the IPO price of Rs 124 apiece.\n\nThe stock then recovered some losses, rising around 6 percent from its listing price to trade at Rs 119.67 apiece. However, it is still down around 3.5 percent from its IPO price of Rs 124 apiece.\n\nShadowfax’sweak stock market debutindicates cautious investor sentiment towards the logistics and new-age business space, said Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth at Swastika Investmart. The discounted listing suggests valuation concerns, and the stock may remain volatile or range-bound in the near term as markets focus on profitability, cash flows and execution, she added.\n\nIPO allottees may hold with a strict stop loss at Rs 105 to protect downside risk, according to the analyst, who further said that fresh investors should avoid immediate entry and consider buying only after price stability, with a similar stop loss of Rs 104–105.\n\n“On the upside, the ₹120–124 zone is likely to act as a resistance in the short term,” she added.\n\nShadowfax is a technology-driven, asset-light logistics company focused on last-mile delivery, express parcels, reverse logistics and quick commerce services, said Mahesh M. Ojha, VP Research and Business Development at Kantilal Chhaganlal Securities. The company operates across more than 2,300 cities and 14,700 PIN codes and serves clients such as Flipkart, Meesho, Swiggy, Blinkit and Nykaa.\n\nAccording to him, the stock may be suitable for high-risk investors given the overall positive industry outlook. Investors with a long-term perspective who have already applied may consider holding the stock, while short-term investors could look to book gains on listing, if any. Fresh investors may wait for price discovery after listing.\n\nThe weak market debut comes despite the IPO of Shadowfax Technologies closing with 1.68 times subscription during its three days of public bidding between January 20 and January 22. Retail individual investors (RII) and qualified institutional buyers (QIB) had booked their respective reserved portion more than 2 times, while non-institutional investors (NII) subscribed 54 percent of their allotted quota.\n\nBengaluru-based technology-led logistics solutions provider Shadowfax Tech moved to the primary capital market to raise Rs 1,907.2 crore through its initial public offering (IPO), which comprised a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 1,000 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of shares worth Rs 907.2 crore by several investors including Flipkart, Eight Roads Investments, Qualcomm, and NewQuest Asia Fund.\n\nThe price band for the IPO was set at Rs 118-124 per share. Investors could bid for a minimum of 120 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,160, and in multiples thereafter.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "India’s crypto sector is seeking capital gains tax rationalisation and re-evaluation of the 1\n\npercent tax deducted at source (TDS)  on every exchange transaction in the Union Budget for 2026-2027.\n\nIt’s going to be more than four years since the 30 percent virtual digital asset (VDA) tax on gains and 1 percent TDS were  levied on  crypto asset transactions, decimating trading volumes on exchanges by over 80 percent. The industry is expecting a revision of these taxes in the Union Budget to catch up with the global crypto sector that had hit an inflection point in 2025, with regulatory movement in the US with the passing of stablecoin-focused Genius Act, followed by a massive Bitcoin rally.\n\nAccording to Dilip Chenoy, Chairman, Bharat Web3 Association (BWA), the current tax regime has no provision for loss set-off, and a one percent TDS on every transaction has reduced onshore liquidity and shifted a significant share of trading to offshore platforms outside effective Indian regulatory oversight.\n\n“This has weakened compliant domestic exchanges and reduced regulatory visibility,” he said, quite contrary to the government’s very perception of implementing TDS for traceability and transparency of crypto asset movements.\n\nChenoy sees Budget 2026-27 as an opportunity to correct these distortions. “The current tax design affects the broader blockchain ecosystem, pushes investment and activity offshore, and limits India’s ability to retain innovation, employment, and accountable growth in the sector\".\n\nIndustry demands expanding of TDS threshold\n\nAshish Singhal, Co-founder, CoinSwitch, one of the largest crypto investment platforms in the country, is hoping for a reduction in TDS on VDA transactions from 1 percent to 0.01 percent.\n\nSinghal said, “Raising the TDS threshold to Rs 5 lakh would help protect small investors from a disproportionate impact.”\n\nIndian exchanges directly deduct TDS on all transactions. At present, the TDS deduction threshold is about Rs 10,000 per year for most categories of taxpayers, individuals and traders and Rs 50,000 per year for small traders and specified persons.\n\nSB Seker, Head of APAC at Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, recommended removal of transaction-level levies in favour of net-revenue generating corporate taxes. “This can improve fairness for retail participants and indicate to them India has moved past the tax-and-deter regime towards a fuller licence-and-supervise one,” he said.\n\n“The way forward lies in pragmatic reforms that bring users back to compliant platforms while strengthening compliance,” said Sumit Gupta, Co-founder at CoinDCX.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by CoinSwitch, taxation is also influencing market behaviour. Nearly 59 percent of respondents have reported reduced participation in crypto investing or trading due to the prevailing tax regime.\n\nAbout 61 percent of respondents are in favour of integrating crypto into India’s mainstream financial taxation system, believing crypto should be taxed similarly to equities or mutual funds. Over 80 percent of the survey respondents want crypto regulations.\n\nWhat was the crypto regulatory update by Finance Ministry?\n\nEarlier this month, the Finance Ministry’s Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)issued updated guidelinesto tighten business operation practices, cybersecurity disclosures and KYC norms for VDA companies registering in India.\n\nAs per the updated guidelines, crypto platforms now have to do more than just allow simple document uploads. Users must take a“live selfie”using software that verifies their presence, typically through eye-blinking or head movement to prevent the use of static photos or deepfakes.\n\nExchanges must record the exact latitude and longitude, date, timestamp, and IP address from which a user starts creating an account.\n\nBinance’s Seker said such regulatory clarity will, in turn, attract more responsible capital. “Clear, consistent operating standards for VDA platforms, aligned with India’s AML/KYC and investor protection priorities, will encourage responsible capital investment, create skilled jobs, and build domestic capabilities,” he said.",

You can email your queries to askwalletwise@nw18.com, and we will try to get a top financial expert to address.\n\nI have bought Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) 2020-21 Series-X subscriptions in my name and in the name of my HUF. The RBI has announced that investors can redeem these bonds from January 19, 2026, after the completion of the fifth year of subscription. With the recent surge in gold prices, I have decided to avail of the early redemption, instead of waiting for the completion of its original tenure of eight years. What are the tax implications if I avail the early redemption window?\n\nExpert’s Advice: Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGB) were issued by the Government of India to conserve foreign exchange and at the same time, offer investors an opportunity to invest in gold. The original tenure of the SGB is eight years but investors can tender their bonds for early redemption after five years of issuance on the half-yearly due date for interest payment.\n\nThe redemption rate of the SGB is announced by the RBI using the simple average of the closing price of 999 purity gold as published by the Indian Bullion and Jewellers Association for the three business days preceding the redemption date.\n\nCapital gains accrue when a capital asset is sold or transferred. The income tax law provides that the redemption of SGB with RBI by an individual investor shall not be treated as a transfer for computing capital gains. This applies not only to redemption on maturity but also to early redemption after five years.\n\nSince this is not treated as a transfer for income-tax purposes, the whole of the redemption proceeds will come tax-free in the hands of investments made in your individual name. The provision of not treating the redemption of SGB with RBI as a transfer is applicable only for an individual investor, and thus the exemption extends only to the individual investor.\n\nTherefore, you will have to pay long-term capital gains tax at 12.5 percent on the difference between the redemption price and issue price of the investment made in the name of your HUF.",

        "full_content": "While Indian equity markets grapple with their own challenges—foreign investor exodus amid disappointing corporate earnings—a far more serious issue is unfolding in global currency markets. The Japanese yen's decline threatens to add volatility across equity markets worldwide. History suggests that unless this currency crisis is arrested, investors should brace for heightened turbulence and accelerated selling pressure.\n\nUnderstanding yen intervention\n\nAt the heart of this crisis lies the question of government intervention in currency markets. Yen intervention occurs when the Japanese government, typically through the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance, actively buys or sells yen in foreign exchange markets to influence its value. The goal is to prevent excessive currency movements that could damage the Japanese economy—a very weak yen inflates import costs and drives up inflation, while an overly strong yen undermines exporters by making Japanese goods less competitive globally.\n\nHistorically, Japan intervened to weaken the yen when it became too strong. However, the playbook changed dramatically from 2022 to 2024. As the Bank of Japan maintained ultra-low interest rates while the Federal Reserve and other central banks aggressively hiked rates, investors fled to higher-yielding currencies, sending the yen plummeting to multi-decade lows. Japan was forced to reverse course, intervening to support rather than suppress its currency.\n\nThroughout 2024, Japan conducted four separate interventions whenever the yen approached or breached 160 per dollar, collectively spending nearly $100 billion to prop up the currency. The market response was violent and immediate.\n\nWhen Japan intervened in late April and early May 2024, deploying a record $36.9 billion in yen purchases on April 29, the Nikkei 225 plunged 12 percent. By July 11, the index had fallen 27% from its peak, illustrating how yen strengthening creates immediate headwinds for Japan's export-heavy economy.\n\nThe most dramatic episode came in early August 2024, not from intervention alone but from the Bank of Japan's rate hike and the subsequent unwinding of yen carry trades. On August 5, Japan's Topix and Nikkei 225 indexes crashed more than 12%—the steepest single-day drop since 1987. Global markets followed suit, though with smaller percentage declines. The cryptocurrency sector bore the brunt, with most coins recording losses up to 20 percent.\n\nYet the recovery proved equally swift. Within 24 hours, the Nikkei surged 10.2 percent as the Bank of Japan signalled it wouldn't raise rates further amid market instability. This whipsaw action underscored the short-term, violent nature of yen intervention's impact, even as markets generally discount these events before they occur.\n\nFast forward to January 2025, and the same dangerous dynamics are reappearing. The yen approached 159.225 on January 23 before sharp warnings from Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi triggered a pullback to 155.6. The pair fell further to 154.2 on January 26—its lowest level since mid-November. But the relief was short-lived as the currency has since rebounded toward 160, with analysts predicting it could reach this critical threshold within days if weakness continues.\n\nThe market received an unprecedented signal on January 24 when the Federal Reserve Bank of New York contacted financial institutions about the yen's exchange rate—a move typically seen as a precursor to intervention and potential coordinated US-Japan action. This sparked the biggest one-day yen rally since August. As analysts warn, when the US Treasury starts making calls, it signals that the situation has escalated beyond a normal foreign-exchange story.\n\nFor now, intervention fears alone have pushed the yen off 18-month lows, offering temporary relief to Japanese policymakers concerned about the currency's inflationary impact.\n\nPolitical and economic headwinds\n\nThe timing couldn't be worse for Japanese authorities. With snap elections scheduled for February, the 160 level has become a politically charged crisis indicator that resonates with Japanese voters, according to local media. The bond market reflects this stress—the 40-year JGB yield broke 4% on January 20 for the first time since 1995, while 30-year yields hit 3.875%, both at historic highs. Meanwhile, traders hold record-high short positions in the yen, making the market vulnerable to a violent squeeze.\n\nCompounding the challenge, nearly all ruling and opposition parties are calling for tax cuts ahead of the election, a stance that adds pressure on the yen.\n\nThe critical question is whether intervention can actually stabilise markets. Analysts remain deeply sceptical. They warn that intervention without supporting policy changes will likely prove ineffective, potentially even allowing traders to build larger short positions within hours. The real solution, they argue, requires a Bank of Japan rate hike, potentially at the upcoming meeting.\n\nAccording to a DBS report, the Bank of Japan is behind the curve in normalising monetary policy, while the government has fallen short of its debt consolidation targets. Yet the broader economy shows resilience—public debt concerns arise amid an economy experiencing vibrant private capital-market activity for the first time in decades, with flourishing M&A activity and a soaring domestic stock market. Japan's public sector debt remains a source of concern, but economic momentum appears unlikely to be derailed. Still, the yen's overshooting may require intervention, especially given the risk of antagonising the United States.\n\nThe limits of US-Japan coordination\n\nDespite signs of coordination between Washington and Tokyo, analysts doubt this represents a lasting solution. Shota Ryu, FX strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, observes: \"In reality, the US probably doesn't want to buy a currency like the yen that has seen its value depreciate for five straight years. Washington could possibly cooperate with one small intervention. But it won't help in a way that could have a lasting effect in turning around the yen's downtrend.\"\n\nThe constraints are mutual. Japan would need to sell portions of its US Treasury holdings to sustain its yen-buying intervention—a move that could push up US yields, something Washington would oppose amid current market volatility. As Takuya Kanda, analyst at Gaitame.com Research Institute, notes: \"It's unlikely the US, worried about global de-dollarisation, will conduct direct dollar-selling intervention.\"\n\nPerhaps the most significant threat lies in what another round of intervention could trigger. A rise in interest rates risks another unwinding of yen carry trades, potentially recreating the August 2024 market chaos. The rapid unwinding demonstrated how a single policy change in Japan can send profound ripples across interconnected global markets, with investors worldwide experiencing significant losses.\n\nThe Japanese government must navigate between allowing inflationary currency weakness and triggering market chaos through heavy-handed intervention. Without genuine monetary policy normalisation from the Bank of Japan, any intervention risks becoming a costly, temporary Band-Aid.\n\nWhether through coordinated intervention, interest rate hikes, or market forces alone, resolution appears inevitable. The question is not if but when—and at what cost to global financial stability. Investors would be wise to monitor the 160 level closely, as a breach could mark the beginning of another turbulent chapter in the ongoing yen crisis, with reverberations felt far beyond Tokyo's trading floors.",

The report added that Toshitaka Tazawa, an analyst at Fujitomi Securities, said that a loss of production in Kazakhstan is also underpinning the rally in oil prices.\n\n\"But once supply fears ease, selling pressure is likely to return,\" Tazawa added. He further said that an estimated global crude supply surplus this year amid geopolitical risks, including the Middle East tensions, could keep WTI trading around $60 a barrel for now.\n\nTensions between US and Iran are also supporting oil prices. Reuters reported citing sources that a US aircraft carrier and supporting warships have arrived in the Middle East. This has raised the prospect of US President Donald Trump following through on his threat to attack Iran's senior leadership in response to the violent crackdown on nationwide protests, said ANZ analysts in a note.\n\nONGC shares jumped more than 7 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 266.2 apiece.

Following last year’s reduction in gold import duty, the industry expects policy continuity in the upcoming Budget, with possibilities for further calibrated cuts.\n\n\"Measures such as duty rationalisation on precious metals, export facilitation, improved access to raw materials through special notified zones and rationalisation of taxes on making charges can boost consumer demand, formalisation, and global competitiveness,\" Malabar Group chairman MP Ahammad said.\n\nGJEPC chairman Kirit Bhansali said that the global gem and jewellery trade is undergoing a major transformation. With high US tariffs, evolving consumer preferences, and shifting global supply chains, it is imperative that India maintains its competitive edge.\n\n\"Our pre-Budget proposals are focused on making Indian exports more cost-efficient, strengthening SEZ operations, and improving policy frameworks that encourage investment and skill development,” Bhansali said.\n\nA key objective is also to establish India as a global diamond trading hub, complementing its position as the world’s leading cutting and polishing centre. With supportive reforms and a stable trade ecosystem, India can not only weather current global challenges but also lead the next phase of growth in the international jewellery market, he said.\n\nGold also holds a special place in Indian culture and savings practices, with households traditionally keeping large amounts in unused jewellery and bars that contribute little to productive use. Promoting the idea of bringing this gold into the formal financial system through gold monetisation can unlock resources for investment, reduce dependence on expensive imports, and ease pressure on the trade deficit.\n\n\"Steps to make the Gold Monetisation Scheme (GMS) more attractive would mobilise household gold that is currently idle, reduce import dependence, and support macroeconomic stability. A growth-oriented Budget that enhances disposable income, eases credit for the trade and continues infrastructure-led development will strengthen organised retail and generate employment,\" Ahammad said.\n\nThe GMS (2015) was a Government of India initiative that allowed individuals and institutions to deposit idle gold (such as jewellery, bars, and coins) with banks to earn interest. Upon maturity, they can redeem it for cash or gold. It aims to mobilise privately held gold for productive purposes, reducing reliance on imports and decreasing storage costs.\n\nTogether, these measures can enhance macroeconomic stability, expand financial markets, and provide savers with better returns, making them key to both fiscal strategy and long-term growth in the Budget 2026.",

It has guided for a ROE (return on equity) of 13.5 percent in FY26 and 14.5 percent in FY27 — levels the bank has already effectively achieved in Q3 FY26.\n\nThe reported ROA (return on asset) and the ROE for the quarter stood at 0.91 percent and 12.73 percent, respectively. However, excluding the one-off impact of the new labour code, the ROA would have been 1.01 percent and the ROE a healthy 14.1 percent in Q3 FY26, underscoring the underlying strength of profitability.\n\nDCB Bank’s stock has outperformed the sector benchmark (Bank Nifty) and overall market (Nifty) surging 46 percent and 70 percent in the past 6 months and 1 year respectively.  The key question now is whether this rally can sustain.\n\nThe most compelling aspect of DCB Bank is its valuation. Even after a sharp rally, the stock trades at only 0.9x its estimated FY27 book value, making it attractive. While a valuation re-rating hinges on the bank’s ability to sustain consistent performance, several profitability levers are in place that could drive further upside.\n\nHealthy business growth, robust fee income\n\nDCB Bank has maintained steady growth, with net advances rising to Rs 56,600 crore as of December 2025, reflecting a 18 percent YoY increase. DCB Bank aims to double its balance sheet over the next 3-3.5 years, targeting an annual loan growth of 18-22 percent.\n\nMortgages constitute around 50 percent of the loan book as of September end.\n\nDCB’s deposits grew by 20 percent YoY till end December’25, higher than the banking system deposit growth, albeit on a smaller base. DCB’s CASA deposits ratio of 23 percent remains much lower compared to the banking system average.\n\nThat said, it is reassuring to see the bank strengthening the granularity of its deposit base. Deposits from the top 20 depositors have come down to 6.61 percent of total deposits as of December 2025, compared to 15 percent in FY18, which adds stability to its funding profile.\n\nDCB Bank’s core fee income grew a strong 29 percent YoY, driven by robust traction in third-party distribution, trade finance, and processing fees. The management expects this momentum to sustain in Q4, which is seasonally strong for fee income. Over the medium term, the bank is confident of sustaining fee income at around 1 percent of average assets, broadly in line with the 1.1 percent achieved in Q3 FY26.\n\nDCB’s net interest margin (NIM) came in at 3.27 percent in Q3 FY26, up 2 basis points YoY from the previous quarter (Q2 FY26). The management has guided to a gradual margin expansion from here onward till Q2 FY27, assuming the RBI doesn’t implement further rate cuts. The improvement is expected to play out over the next 3-4 quarters as the bank’s long-tenure fixed deposits will mature and get repriced at lower rates.\n\nIn addition to lower funding costs, improved yields are expected to drive margin expansion. Over the past five years, DCB Bank has steadily built its home loan portfolio, which now accounts for nearly half of its mortgage book. Going forward, the bank aims to raise the share of businessloans(LAP), which generate higher yields than home loans, while keeping the lower-margin co-lending portfolio capped at 15 percent of total advances.\n\nThe bank had borrowings of more than Rs 8,000 crore as of March’25, which has declined to less than Rs 5,000 crore as the bank replaced it with relatively lower cost deposits.\n\nTogether, the decline in funding costs and a more profitable product mix should support margin expansion.\n\nDCB Bank effectively controlled its operating expenses aided by a reduction in employee base. Despite the one-off expense of Rs 27 crore in Q3 FY26, the cost-to-average assets ratio remained stable at 2.59 percent in Q3 FY26. Looking forward, the bank expects to benefit from the operating leverage as the balance sheet grows further. The management anticipates the cost-to-average-assets ratio to remain steady in the range of 2.5-2.6 percent and targets a cost-to-income ratio of 60 percent or below in the near term.\n\nDCB Bank’s asset quality improved meaningfully in Q3 FY26, with a decline in both gross and net NPAs. More importantly, slippages fell to an 18-quarter low, signalling better asset quality trends. As a result, credit costs remained contained at just 37 bps—well below management’s guided 45 bps—even after accounting for floating provisions.\n\nThe restructured book eased slightly but remains elevated at Rs 811 crore (1.4 percent of advances) as of December 2025 and needs to be monitored closely.\n\nOverall, DCB bank is poised for a healthy loan growth, margin expansion (assuming no further rate cut), stable cost-to-assets ratio, and a very low credit cost in near to medium term. This guidance is very encouraging and should drive healthy earnings growth in FY27\n\nDespite the sharp rally post earnings, DCB Bank is trading at just 1 time FY27 estimated book value. The valuation can move above 1x forward BV on sectoral tailwinds which along with healthy earnings growth will drive a meaningful stock upside in the near to medium term. Long-term investors should buy the stock.\n\nFollow@nehadave01.For more research articles, visit our Moneycontrol Research page.",

The rebound is being reinforced by strong institutional participation, as public companies continue to add digital assets to their balance sheets,\" said Akshat Siddhant, lead quant analyst, Mudrex.\n\nAccording to Riya Sehgal, research analyst, Delta Exchange, from a technical lens, bitcoin must decisively break above $90,000–$91,200 to shift short-term bias upward, while support remains anchored near $87,500 and $86,000. \"Until a clear macro trigger emerges, BTC is likely to trade within defined consolidation ranges, balancing recovery optimism against macro caution,\" she said.\n\nEthereum was up 1.87 percent, BNB 1.35 percent, Solana 1.83 percent, Dogecoin 1.14 percent and Cardano 0.77 perce. Tether was down 0.03 percent, XRP 0.61 percent, USDC 0.01 percent and Tron declined 0.87 percent in the past 24 hours.\n\n\"The rest of the cryptos within the top 10 are accumulating gains below their resistance, which is becoming a threshold to secure. Besides, altcoins like pippin, Hyperliquid, and Pump.fun lead the top gainers with a rise of 66.28%, 30.23,% and 15.49% respectively. River leads the losers with over 8% drop, followed by Axie Infinity and Morpho by 6.17% and 3.97%, respectively,\" said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\nHere's how the price of cryptocurrencies has moved.\n\n\"BTC edged higher, supported by a softer US dollar and improving short-term market structure. The dollar index fell to around 95.5, its weakest level in nearly four years, lowering the opportunity cost of holding risk assets and supporting BTC’s rebound from below $88K to around $89.3K. However, as liquidity builds near $90K–$92K and the Fed is expected to hold rates today, markets will also closely watch the Fed’s guidance,\" said CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\nAccording to Avinash Shekhar, co-Founder & CEO, Pi42, bitcoin’s range-bound movement at around $89,000 highlights the influence of global macro developments on the crypto market. \"Importantly, selling pressure has not increased materially, with prices continuing to respect key demand zones. As macro clarity improves and leveraged positions unwind, bitcoin’s ability to hold this range keeps the broader market structure intact, positioning the market for its next decisive move,\" he said.\n\nWhat’s happening in the crypto market?\n\nHere’s a rundown of the crypto market according to WazirX founder Nischal Shetty and CoinDCX research team:",

        "full_content": "With Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman set to present the Budget for FY27 on February 1, corporate India seems to be divided on personal income tax. While a large section senior executives expects continuity, a sizeable number of industry leaders are expecting rejig of slabs to offer relief to taxpayers .\n\nAccording to a Moneycontrol-Deloitte CXO survey, which drew responses from 46 industry leaders across sectors, 34.8 percent of respondents expect a stable tax regime with no changes in either the old or new tax structures, suggesting that the government will prioritise fiscal consolidation and continuity over change.\n\nNearly one in five respondents (17.4 percent) expect a reduction in slab rates under the new tax regime, indicating continued hope that the government may further sweeten the default regime.\n\nAnother 23.9 percent respondents said slab rates could be cut across both old and new regimes, reflecting demands for broad-based tax relief amid rising household expenses and inflation-driven cost pressures.\n\nExpectations around deductions show a clear bias towards the new regime. As many as 21.7 percent of respondents expect an increase in standard deduction under the new regime, reinforcing the belief that any relief, if offered, will be channelled through simplicity rather than exemptions.\n\nOnly a very small fraction expects higher deductions under the old regime, underlining the growing consensus that the exemption-heavy system is unlikely to see any meaningful revival.\n\nWhat the survey signals for Budget 2026?\n\nThe survey suggest that taxpayers are gradually aligning their expectations with the government’s stated policy direction. Since the new tax regime was made the default and was significantly liberalised in the previous Budget with a higher rebate limit and revised slabs, there is little space for dramatic cuts.\n\nRespondents appear to be betting on incremental changes such as higher standard deduction.\n\nAn important insights from the survey is the near absence of expectations around enhanced deductions under the old regime. This aligns with recent data showing a steady migration towards the new tax system, even though around 29 percent of taxpayers still opt for the old regime due to legacy deductions such as HRA, educationloanand home loan interest.\n\nThe survey was conducted by Moneycontrol and Deloitte between December 2025 and January 2026. It includes CXOs from across industries such as banking and insurance, manufacturing, transport and logistics, energy, life sciences and health, telecom and tech and e-commerce.",

        "full_content": "The shares ofAsian Paintstumbled nearly 7 percent on January 28 as brokerages analysed the company's results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026.\n\nThe shares of the paint-maker dropped to Rs 2,451 apiece in the early trading hours of Wednesday. This is the lowest level seen by the stock since October last year.\n\nAsian Paints on January 28 reported aconsolidated net profit of Rs 1,060 crorefor Q3 FY26, marking a 4.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall from Rs 1,110.48 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. This however includes exceptional items of Rs 157.61 crore due to labour code and Impairment loss following acquisition of Obgenix Software Private Limited ('White Teak').\n\nThe firm's revenue from operations meanwhile rose around 4 percent YoY to Rs 8,867.02 crore. Consolidated net sales increased 3.9 percent YoY to Rs 8,849.7 crore during the quarter under review.\n\nMotilal Oswal on Asian Paints:\n\nMotilal Oswal said that Asian Paints delivered a \"lacklustre performance\" as growth delivery remained soft despite a favorable base and multiple initiatives. \"A shorter festive period and an extended monsoon did weigh on 3Q performance and further delay demand recovery,\" the brokerage said.\n\n\"The management commentary on demand recovery was uninspiring, especially after the constructive commentary post-2QFY26. APNT expects volumes to be in the 8-10% range and value growth of ~5% in the near term. That said, management maintained its EBITDA margin guidance of 18-20%, aided by formulation and sourcing efficiencies. We model 10% revenue CAGR over FY26-28E along with ~19% EBITDA margin for FY27/FY28E,\" Motilal added.\n\nGiven slower demand recovery and competitive pressure, Motilal expects the near-term growth outlook to remain muted. \"However, as the paint category enjoys pentup demand, we will be watchful if the recovery pace picks up faster in the coming seasonal quarters. The company is focusing on product innovation, brand salience, regionalization, and execution excellence to negate competitive pressure,\" it added.\n\nMotilal cut its EPS estimates by 1-3 percent over FY26-28E. It reiterated its ‘Neutral’ rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 2,950 apiece, which implies an upside potential of nearly 12.5 percent over the stock's previous closing price.\n\nJM Financial said that the company's Q3 results were marginally below expectation. \"Decorative volume/value growth of 7.9%/2.8% YoY was below ours and consensus estimate, despite weak base, owing to shorter festive (impacted October sales, November/December had better growth) and extended monsoons. Management remains cautious on demand trends – a) sees mid-single-digit sales growth as reasonable in near term led by volume growth of c.8-10% and negative price/mix impact of c.4-5% (similar to trends seen in 2Q/3Q), b) prolonged softness in industry growth seen due to some reduction in frequency of painting/occasion-led painting and consumer shift to other discretionary spends. Moreover, based on current trends the negative mix impact (c.4-5%) is likely to sustain for next few quarters (will percolate into FY27E),\" the brokerage said.\n\nIt cut FY27/28E earnings estimate by 2-3 percent. JM Financial maintained its ‘Reduce’ call on the stock, while lowering its target price to Rs 2,735 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 4 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.\n\nCLSA kept an ‘Underperform’ call on the shares of Asian Paints, with a target price of Rs 1,875 apiece. This implies a downside potential of more than 28.5 percent over the stock’s previous closing price.\n\nThe international brokerage said that the firm’s consolidated revenue growth was 2 percent below forecast, while standalone volume growth of 7.9 percent was in-line with an earlier festive season.\n\nIt cut FY26-28 earnings estimate by 0-7 percent to account for persistence in gap between revenue and volume growth.\n\nHSBC downgraded the shares of Asian Paints to ‘Hold’, and cut its target price to Rs 2,900 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 11 percent over the previous closing price.\n\nThe international brokerage said that the firm saw disappointing volume and revenue growth in Q3 FY26. Relatively weaker retail demand trends could persist longer, it added.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

This marks a discount of 9.19 percent over the IPO price of Rs 124 apiece.\n\nThe company debuted with a market capitalization of Rs 6,509.78 crore.\n\nOn BSE, the shares listed with a slightly lower discount of 8.87 percent over the IPO price at Rs 113 apiece.\n\nListing performance vs grey market estimates:\n\nThe listing has missed grey market expectations. Ahead of listing, the unlisted shares of Shadowfax Technologies were trading with a grey market discount o 2.82 percent over the IPO price at Rs 120.5 apiece. The grey market estimates quoted by the site has significantly fallen from the 12.90 percent quoted on January 15.\n\nAccording to IPO Watch, the unlisted shares of the company were trading flat at the IPO price at Rs 124 apiece in the grey market.\n\nThe weak market debut comes despite the IPO of Shadowfax Technologies closing with1.68 times subscriptionduring its three days of public bidding between January 20 and January 22. Retail individual investors (RII) and qualified institutional buyers (QIB) had booked their respective reserved portion more than 2 times, while non-institutional investors (NII) subscribed 54 percent of their allotted quota.\n\nBengaluru-based technology-led logistics solutions provider Shadowfax Tech moved to the primary capital market to raise Rs 1,907.2 crore through its initial public offering (IPO), which comprised a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 1,000 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of shares worth Rs 907.2 crore by several investors including Flipkart, Eight Roads Investments, Qualcomm, and NewQuest Asia Fund.\n\nThe price band for the IPO was set at Rs 118-124 per share. Investors could bid for a minimum of 120 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,160, and in multiples thereafter.\n\nHow will the IPO proceeds be used?\n\nThe company proposes to utilise proceeds from the fresh issue towards funding enhancing capacity in terms of network infrastructure, funding of lease payments for new first mile, last mile, and sort centres, as well as towards branding, marketing, and communication initiatives, unidentified inorganic acquisitions, and general corporate purposes.\n\nA day before the IPO opened for public bidding, Shadowfax announced that it has raised Rs 856.02 crore from 39 anchor investors on January 19.\n\n\"Out of the total allocation, 3.67 crore equity shares worth Rs 455.73 crore were allocated to nine domestic mutual funds including ICICI Prudential AMC, Nippon Life India, Motilal Oswal AMC, Bandhan Mutual Fund, HSBC MF, Helios MF, JM Financial MF, and Trust Mutual Fund,\" Shadowfax Technologies in its filing to exchanges said.\n\nICICI Prudential AMC was the largest investor in the anchor book, acquiring 1.53 crore equity shares for Rs 190 crore through its four schemes - ICICI Prudential Flexicap Fund, ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage Fund, ICICI Prudential Transportation and Logistics Fund, and ICICI Prudential Exports and Services Fund.\n\nShadowfax is a technology-driven, asset-light logistics company focused on last-mile delivery, express parcels, reverse logistics and quick commerce services, said Mahesh M. Ojha, VP Research and Business Development at Kantilal Chhaganlal Securities. The company operates across more than 2,300 cities and 14,700 PIN codes and serves clients such as Flipkart, Meesho, Swiggy, Blinkit and Nykaa.\n\nThe analyst highlighted that the IPO valuation appears relatively rich, when compared to peers like Delhivery. The business also faces intense competition and customer concentration risks, with a significant portion of revenue coming from a small number of large clients.\n\nAccording to him, the stock may be suitable for high-risk investors given the overall positive industry outlook. Investors with a long-term perspective who have already applied may consider holding the stock, while short-term investors could look to book gains on listing, if any. Fresh investors may wait for price discovery after listing.\n\nGaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk, noted that Shadowfax offers a compelling play on India’s rapidly growing e-commerce and quick-commerce ecosystem. \"With pan-India reach across over 14,700 pincodes and a client roster that includes Flipkart, Meesho, Swiggy, Zomato, and Blinkit, the company has demonstrated strong revenue growth (~32% CAGR FY23–25) and operational scalability through its large gig-based delivery network. Its asset-light model and EBITDA-positive performance since FY24 highlight its improving profitability trajectory,\" the analyst said.\n\nHe however cautioned that investors should be mindful of the risks and structural constraints. \"Margins remain thin, ROE and ROCE are modest, and revenue is concentrated with its top client contributing around 50%. At the upper price band, the IPO implies an EV/EBITDA of ~106x, which is rich compared with peers, suggesting that current valuations already reflect significant growth expectations,\" he said.\n\nOverall, Shadowfax offers long-term exposure to India’s logistics and hyperlocal delivery sector, but the IPO is better suited for investors with a long-term horizon, who are comfortable tracking execution, client diversification, and margin expansion over time, the analyst said. He added that for short-term listing gains, the risk-reward appears balanced but neutral.",

        "full_content": "SBFC Finance’s stock plunged 11 percent on January 26 after the company announced that co-founder Aseem Dhru was stepping down as the managing director and chief executive officer.\n\nAnnouncing the changes, which took investors by surprise, the company said on January 24 that co-founder Mahesh Dayani would take over as MD & CEO from April 1. Dhru would transition to a non-executive, non-independent director role designated as vice chairman.\n\nDhru, who co-founded SBFC Finance with Dayani in September 2017 after leaving HDFC Bank, told Moneycontrol in an interview that he would be around to ensure a smooth transition and time will bear out his decision to handover control to Dayani.Edited excerpts:\n\nStock market hasn’t taken your stepping down kindly. For an investor, it’s impossible to separate you from the company. What do you have to say?\n\nUnlike a lot of other companies, SBFC has always been a professionally run company. We were not promoter run at any point of time and that is how it was built — professionals who came together to with a common objective to build an institution that can outlast us.\n\nBy definition, individuals have finite lives, energies and timeframes. The real test of what has been built is whether it outlasts you, because if you have to keep doing it all the time, then clearly it hasn’t been built right.\n\nNormally what I've seen in financial services is that it has been a challenge to bring about a transition. (With SBFC) I thought that we can do it a little differently where I move away from the role of a player into that of a coach. I can be of help and contribute to the company to ensure that the transition is smooth. The company's fundamentals remain where they are and the numbers will do the talking.\n\nBut as much as we want to say that companies are larger than the persons running it, they are also a reflection of their CEOs …\n\nThere is no doubt that individuals have their stamps, especially in financial services. Unlike in manufacturing or other businesses, like organisations of the scale of Coca-Cola or cement or steel,  even if the CEO is not a very good, the company faces temporary challenges but manages to get by just fine. Somebody else comes and builds it up.\n\nIn financial services it is tricky. The impact of CEO on financial services is very direct and present. The comfort here (with SBFC) is that it is not a call that the organisation is taking because we (the founding team) built this organisation together from Day One. It is just that I had more visibility because of the nature of the designation.\n\nWhat was that tipping point that convinced you that Mahesh Dayani should take over?\n\nIt’s a job which requires extreme amount of passion, focus and energy. You need to demonstrate it on a day-to-day basis. The minute you realise that you are not pulling your weight is when you realise that time has come to give it to the person who can take the organisation forward.\n\nGenuinely, I believe that at this moment, he (Dayani) is better placed than me to take this company forward. I hope the numbers and history will wear me out. I have literally put my money on him! There are many interests in life one wants to pursue, not necessarily within the financial sector.Aur bhi gham hain zamane mein, mohabbat ke siwa. Also, once you get very good at something, it becomes second nature and we become comfortable but then growth stops. Growth only comes from the zone of discomfort, and to that extent, I'm putting myself in a zone of discomfort.\n\nYour departure comes at a time when growth seems to be slowing and the industry is not in a comfortable position. Even larger players are under pressure.\n\nIn finance business, there is always demand. The challenge is to segregate between need and demand. It is just the ability of a customer to repay theloanwhich needs assessment.\n\nIf you read the RBI’s financial stability report, it very clearly states that the small Indian retail consumer is overleveraged. You need to be careful that you don't really tip him off, which is what happened with microfinance and unsecured lending. One has to be careful that in the chase for growth, you don't really give loan to a guy who struggle to repay.\n\nGrowth is a function of what the market is and what your size is. If you're small, then the market size doesn't really matter.  We can decide at what rate we want to grow. The challenge is in setting the culture of the company and what growth it can digest. Cancer also is ultimately growth! We need to be careful of that in all times.\n\nSBFC has moved in the construct of 5–7 percent quarter-on-quarter growth, so that ultimately we build a boring compounding business and not something that is exciting and can deliver great results in good times, and then struggle in difficult ones.\n\nIn 2022, you were one of the first to flag the stress that was building in the retail space. Four years later, we are still talking about it.\n\nIf most of the debt is not going towards asset creation, which is what the RBI report says, that is not a good place to be. When growth has been above the pace that the system can take, it has led to accidents, whether it is credit costs going up or operating costs peaking.\n\nSecondly, the end use of money has always defined the outcome of your loan. If the end use has been productive, the outcome has been better. When the end use is non-productive that’s where the problem starts for a lender.\n\nIt is also about the risk spectrum one is operating in. If I were a bank and operating at the best level of credit risk, the concern is lower because the borrower is a little more aware and has multiple means to repay the loan. When lending to small businesses and individuals at the bottom of the pyramid, they do not have the discipline or the savings. You have to be more careful than others because the customer segment is a vulnerable one. Most Indians are one hospitalisation away from bankruptcy and that’s the challenge.\n\nFrom inception to where SBFC is now, is it a \"mission accomplished\"  for you?\n\nWe set out to build an institution that will create societal value over cycles. It's good where we have come, so far. We are very happy. God has been kind. We couldn't have hoped for a better outcome but the job isn't anywhere (near) done yet. For that satisfaction, I will have to wait a decade at least.\n\nWhat is your next entrepreneurial bug?\n\nNothing at the moment. The focus is just to ensure that the transition is smooth and I keep giving all the support it needs. For me, the salary stops but the work doesn't.\n\nYou also wanted to see SBFC as a small finance bank. Does the idea still interest you?\n\nIt does but the current regulation doesn't allow it. Promoter ownership cannot be more than 40 percent and we are 51 percent foreign owned. Right now the focus is to just build a wonderful NBFC instead of building just one more bank.\n\nA lot of large banks might start looking out for CEOs in the months to come. Would running a bank interest you?\n\nAs they say, never say never but that is not on the horizon or on my mind as of now. The focus is to ensure that SBFC has a smooth transition. Until I accomplish that, I wouldn't feel that I've done justice to either myself or to those who have trusted me.\n\nWould your association continue for another year?\n\nI've not put a timeframe to it but it will take its time.",

The metal surged to its peak performance on Monday, trading at $117 per ounce amid geopolitical tension led by US President Donald Trump, and continued industrial demand.\n\nThe metal's futures price on MCX opened Wednesday's session at an all-time high of Rs 3,80,200, representing a 4.98 percent gain from its previous close. Silver previously hit a record high of Rs 3,69,000 on January 27, 2026.\n\nThe Indian Bullion Jewellers Association (IBJA) pegged the silver price at Rs 3,44,564 in its 18:30 rate session on January 27,  which is an 8.45 percent gain from the previous price at Rs 3,17,705 per kilogram.\n\nSilver rates across India’s major cities showed remarkable uniformity, with only marginal differences due to local taxes, jeweller margins, and logistics costs.\n\nHere is how a kilogram of silver has moved.\n\nOutlook: Will silver continue its momentum\n\nRenewed geopolitical tensions have been a key trigger. The US President Donald Trump announced a 100 percent tariff threat on Canada over a potential trade deal with China and raised tariffs on South Korean autos, pharmaceuticals, and lumber to 25 percent. These developments have reinforced safe-haven demand.\n\nThe Augmont Bullion report, published on January 28, noted that silver achieved $100 and $107 targets and may consolidate before resuming higher towards $120 (Rs 3,90,000). Key support is seen at $103 (Rs 3,40,000); a break could lead to retracement towards $100 and $97.\n\n\"For precious metals this year, the dominant driver has been policy uncertainty under Trump. A fresh wave of first-time investors, especially across Asia and Europe, is aggressively building personal holdings of gold and silver, adding structural support to prices,\" the report states.",

        "full_content": "With Budget 2026 approaching, the insurance industry hopes for a hike in tax deductions, extension of tax benefits to the new tax regime for both health and life policies, and a resolution of the input tax credit (ITC) on GST.\n\nThe industry believes that these moves would encourage households to opt for adequate protection, ensure tax parity for annuity and pension products, and contain premiums if the ITC anomaly is resolved.\n\nCurrently, the old tax regime allows a deduction of up to Rs 25,000 for individuals and families below 60 years of age and Rs 50,000 for senior citizens under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act.\n\nSubrata Mondal, Managing Director & CEO of IFFCO-TOKIO General Insurance, argues that these limits no longer reflect rising medical inflation. “Doubling the deduction would encourage households to opt for adequate protection rather than minimal coverage and support long-term financial security.”\n\nTax analysts, on the other hand, say that the deduction should also be extended to individuals opting for the new tax regime. “Extending deduction benefits to the new tax regime will ensure that the pursuit of a simpler tax code does not inadvertently discourage essential health coverage,” said Shravanth Shanker, Managing Partner, B. Shanker Advocates.\n\nExtend deduction benefits on life insurance to new tax regime\n\nThe Income Tax Act provides tax benefits for life insurance premiums and proceeds received upon maturity or upon the insured's death. Section 80C allows a tax benefit of up to Rs 1.5 lakh on premiums, and a tax-free payout under Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act. However, these benefits apply only under the old tax regime.\n\n“Rationalising income-tax deductions for life insurance premiums under both old and new tax regimes, expanding the threshold for taxing high-value policy payouts, and ensuring tax parity for annuity and pension products could bolster long-term retirement planning,” said Vipin Upadhyay, Partner, King Stubb & Kasiva, Advocates and Attorneys.\n\nTax analysts say that the introduction of distinct tax deductions for term life insurance premiums can be modelled on the additional deductions available for pension savings under the National Pension System (NPS).\n\n“Experts are also pressing for consistent tax treatment of life insurance gain outcomes, noting that traditional policies with higher annual premiums face less favourable tax rules compared with unit-linked contracts,” said Rajarshi Dasgupta, Executive Director (Tax), Aquilaw.\n\nResolve Input Tax Credit anomaly\n\nThe industry is also seeking a resolution to the input tax credit (ITC) on goods and services tax (GST). ITC allows businesses to offset taxes paid on purchases, and insurers say its non-availability significantly increases costs and impacts profitability from policies.\n\nAlthough GST exemptions on retail life and health insurance have eased costs for policyholders, insurers remain unable to claim input tax credits on critical services such as distribution, customer support, and technology.\n\n“These unrecoverable expenses elevate operating costs and eventually translate into higher premiums. The industry is urging the government to introduce a more flexible input credit framework and undertake broader GST rationalisation in Budget 2026 to contain cost escalation,” said Parimal Heda, Chief Investment Officer, Go Digit General Insurance.",

        "full_content": "Mithun Sacheti, founder and former chief executive of CaratLane, is exploring a full acquisition of Orra Fine Jewellery, as he looks to re-enter the sector that delivered one of the biggest exits in India’s consumer space, people aware of the matter toldMoneycontrol.\n\nWho is Sacheti and what is his connection with the jewellery industry?\n\nSacheti has been in the jewellery industry for over 25 years, first with his family business, Jaipur Gems, and later with CaratLane. In 2023,Sacheti struck gold when he sold CaratLane to Titan in a near-$2 billion deal, one of the largest liquidity events in India’s consumer ecosystem.\n\nHe has been an angel investor and has backed VIP Industries, Ippopay, Bombay Shirt Company, Oro Safe and Nazara Technologies among others. Sacheti is also a general partner and co-sponsor at Singularity Growth, a venture capital firm, and a limited partner in Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal's 021 Capital.\n\nHow will Sacheti and Orra deal look like?\n\nSacheti is now returning to the jewellery industry and is looking to repeat the success he had in the past. This time, Sacheti is likely to team up with Plutus Wealth Management, a boutique proprietary investment firm, to take full control of Orra, sources said.\n\nHow are Sacheti and Plutus Wealth Management related?\n\nPlutus, like Sacheti, is an active investor in Indian companies. The wealth management firm has backed Happiest Minds, RateGain, CredAble and other businesses in India.\n\nPlutus’ Managing Partner and co-founder Arpit Khandelwal and Sacheti have worked together in the past and jointly invested in Nazara Technologies, a gaming and sports media developer.\n\nOrra will now be their next big bet together.\n\nHow much money Sacheti and Plutus will put in together, how it will be split and how much equity each will hold was not immediately clear.\n\nSacheti, Orra and Plutus Wealth did not reply to Moneycontrol’s queries.\n\nWhat is Orra Fine Jewellery and what valuation is it commanding?\n\nOrra Fine Jewellery is a Mumbai-based traditional jewellery business. It clocked a revenue of Rs 1,241 crore and a profit of Rs 6.4 crore in FY25, according to Tracxn, a private markets data provider. In FY24, it had revenues of Rs 1,156 crore and incurred a loss of Rs 11.3 crore.\n\nA business like Orra would be worth four to  six times its revenue, which would roughly translate to a valuation of about Rs 4,900-7,500 crore ($540-830 million), rough estimates by two industry executives say.\n\nIt has about 100 retail stores and plans to scale up under Sacheti’s leadership.\n\n“Mithun has charted plans to scale Orra’s revenues to about Rs 8,000-10,000 crore in 4-5 years from now,” one of the persons cited above told Moneycontrol.\n\nAre there legal hurdles in the way of Sacheti operating a jewellery brand?\n\nSacheti's legal binding ended a few months ago and he is free to operate in the space again.\n\nIn an interview to Moneycontrol in 2023, Sacheti had indicated he would consider running a similar business once his non-compete clause ends. While he had not commented on the specifics back then, he said a non-compete clause which prohibits the founder from starting up again for more than 24 months is “criminal”.",

The question on factors influencing India’s growth over the next three years was answered by 46 respondents and allowed multiple selections. Innovation and research and development emerged as the next most-cited growth factor at 61 percent. Manufacturing-focused initiatives, including the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme and the Make in India programme, were identified by 56.5 percent of CXOs as influencing growth prospects.\n\nTrade, services and MSMEs also feature as growth drivers\n\nTrade policy measures such as free trade agreements and supply-chain integration were selected by 52 percent of CXOs, indicating continued emphasis on export-led growth. Services sector expansion, including exports and employment generation, was cited by 39 percent, while sustained growth in micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) was flagged by an equal 39 percent.\n\nAbout 35 percent pointed to the start-up ecosystem, while foreign direct investment inflows were selected by 30 percent.\n\nEase of doing business and geopolitical issues were cited by just 2 percent each, suggesting these were seen as less immediate contributors to growth over the next three years.\n\nTop five reform areas government should focus on\n\nIn a separate question asking CXOs to select the top five reform areas the government should focus on to drive economic growth, physical infrastructure and logistics emerged as the most frequently cited priority, with 65 percent selecting it.\n\nA demand-side push through income growth and consumption support followed closely at 63 percent. Regulatory predictability and compliance reduction was identified by 56.5 percent, emphasising the importance of policy stability for long-term investment decisions.\n\nInnovation, research and development and deep-technology commercialisation was selected by 48 percent of CXOs. 44 percent highlighted digital public infrastructure and artificial intelligence enablement as a key reform priority, while an equal share of CXOs also cited attracting foreign investment through reforms.\n\nInvestment climate and execution-related reforms\n\nJudicial and dispute-resolution reforms were selected among the top five reform priorities by 35 percent of CXOs. Energy infrastructure and sustainability was identified by 33 percent. Trade and export push and supply-side competitiveness were each selected by 28 percent, while MSME competitiveness and formalisation was cited by 22 percent.\n\nLower down the list were critical minerals and clean energy supply chains at 20 percent, boosting credit uptake and working-capital access at 15 percent, and global capability centres and high-value services ecosystems at 11 percent.\n\n\"Sustaining India’s growth momentum will require a continued focus on physical infrastructure, energy systems and trade enablers, supported by a demand-side push through public spending and targeted tax incentives. Strengthening energy infrastructure and clean-energy supply chains will be critical to both growth and sustainability objectives. Equally important is creating a stable, predictable regulatory environment that attracts long-term domestic and foreign capital, enabling India to integrate more deeply into global value chains and scale private investment,\" one of the respondents commented.\n\n\"Demand has been slowing down, and the government needs to focus on reviving and sustaining it. However, this demand should be met through greater domestic manufacturing and technology products, rather than relying on global companies and solutions,\" another respondent wrote.\n\nThe Moneycontrol- Deloitte CXO survey  was conducted by Moneycontrol and Deloitte between December 2025 and January 2026. The survey includes CXOs from across industries, such as, Banking and Insurance; Manufacturing; Transport and Logistics; Energy; Life Sciences and Health; Telecom and Tech; E-commerce. The respondents are representatives  of  companies across three categories - very large corporates (above Rs 3000 cr); large corporate company (Rs 500 cr to Rs 3000 cr) and MSMEs (Rs 500 cr and below).",

Immediate resistance is seen near Rs 1,62,500, while strong support is placed around Rs 1,55,000,\" said Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities.",

        "full_content": "Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget FY27 comes at a time when external factors weigh heavily on the economy than domestic challenges.\n\nThe most significant external challenge is the US-imposed tariffs on Indian exports. India’s repeated attempts to sign a comprehensive trade treaty with the US have reached nowhere. The additional punitive tariff of 25% is still in force. It appears that there is no visible progress in the trade negotiations, so far, due to many unresolved market-access issues. This acts as a major drag on the economy as the US accounts for one-fifth of India’s total merchandise exports. It also foments trouble for the economy in myriad ways like rupee depreciation, capital flight (FPI selloff and decline in FDI), revenue loss, dip in forex reserves, weakening of balance of payment system, loss of labour and production, stagnant exports, and many more.\n\nThe domestic market has priced in the global uncertainty, which is continuing ever since Russia’s Ukraine invasion, Israel-Palestine conflicts, simmering US-Iran tensions and the latest US–Europe standoff over Greenland. It seems the market has also priced in the near-impossibility of the trade deal in the near-to-medium term due to the US president’s love-hate relationship with India. However, the investors expect a clear fiscal roadmap from the Budget on how to proceed from here.\n\nThe Budget must also spell out measures to strengthen corporate earnings growth, which are vital in bringing back FPIs and re-energize market. For some time, valuation in the domestic market has been high compared to other emerging markets and that’s why the FPIs were continuously selling here and buying in other lucrative markets. The only way to justify this higher valuation is a handsome growth in corporate earnings, which will embolden FPI comeback.\n\nAt this juncture, adhering to fiscal glide path would be difficult for the FM. Probably, it may hover around the current level of 4.4% of the GDP. Or the government may turn its focus on the ‘debt-to-GDP’ indicator, rather than a fixed deficit target, to maintain its fiscal headroom. Fiscal consolidation is important for managing currency and fiscal stability, and crowding in private investment.\n\nBut it must be noted that aggressive tightening will adversely affect public spending and long-term growth. Also, the current fiscal year’s record capital expenditure of Rs 11.21 lakh crore has failed to enthuse private capital expenditure. It shows a deep malaise, signifying an inherent weakness in domestic demand and consumption. Thus, the Budget must finely balance between fiscal consolidation and capital expenditure.\n\nNobody is expecting tax sops this time. Instead, the market expects a favourable tax regime and stimulus to enhance India Inc’s export competitiveness and manufacturing prowess. However, the restructuring of GST rates, reduction in personal income tax, and special export assistance have led to a fall in the government’s tax revenue, which makes the Budget management even more challenging. To compensate this, the FM has to rely on non-tax revenues such as PSU dividends, disinvestment, RBI dividends, and auction of natural resources.\n\nOn growth front, the picture is brighter. India is one of the fastest-growing emerging economies in the world. In the current fiscal year, economy is estimated to grow above 7% despite these hurdles. Shifting global power balances and strategic requirements will force the FM to allocate more funds to defence sector. The big positive is that private defence manufacturers are set to gain from it.\n\nWe can expect more liberalization from the Budget, especially in the banking, financial services and insurance sectors as it is essential for lifting market sentiments and India’s global ambitions. Finally, the Budget’s focus would be on enhancing growth, reviving consumption and stimulating economy against the backdrop of a challenging and pessimistic global order.",

        "full_content": "Many Silver ETFs are trading at a sharp premium to their indicative net asset value (iNAV) these days, highlighting strong buying pressure from investors. The gap between the market price and the iNAV widened throughout the day on Tuesday, pointing to heightened retail demand and speculative activity in the silver market.\n\nFor instance, HDFC Silver ETF closed at Rs 323, while its i-NAV stood lower at Rs 300.  Similarly, Nippon India Silver ETF closed at Rs 318, while its i-NAV stood higher at Rs 327. However, SBI Silver ETF closed at Rs 329, while its i-NAV was higher at Rs 345, indicating the unit traded at a discount to its underlying value.\n\nPiyush Jhunjhunwala, founder and chief executive of Stockify, said, \"If a silver ETF trades above its net asset value (NAV), it usually signals strong investor interest, driven by rising demand for silver as an investment.\"\n\nETF prices can be volatile and often reflect short-term investor sentiment more than the actual movement in the price of silver itself. A surge in retail buying is also a key driver of demand for commodity ETFs, which many investors view as a safer way to gain exposure compared with direct stock market investments.\n\nJhunjhunwala said, “When an ETF's share price is higher than both its indicative net asset value (iNAV) and its net asset value (NAV), that means investors are willing to pay significantly more for the ETF than the actual worth of the silver that it holds.”\n\nThe iNAV is calculated using the current market price of silver and updates continuously during the trading day. The NAV, by contrast, is calculated at the end of each trading session. In normal conditions, ETF prices tend to track their iNAV and NAV closely because of arbitrage activity. When an ETF trades at a premium, authorised participants can create new units by delivering silver to the fund and selling those units in the market, a process that usually helps bring prices back in line with the underlying value.\n\n\"A gap between the market price and the NAV of a commodity ETF may indicate that buying interest is stronger than what arbitrage mechanisms can absorb in the short term. This can create a temporary imbalance in the market,\" said Saurabh Bansal, founder of Finatwork Investment Advisor, a SEBI-registered investment adviser.\n\n“The concept of arbitrage generally allows prices to catch up after short-term differences. However, large swings caused by heavy trading volumes can lead to temporary dislocations, which usually return to equilibrium over time,” said Bansal.\n\nWhen an ETF trades at a significant premium to its iNAV or NAV, it reflects high demand for exposure to silver. Investors may be reacting to market sentiment, inflation concerns or speculation. Because of the relationship between ETF units and the underlying silver bullion, prices may not adjust immediately to changes in supply. This can allow a short-lived premium to emerge, particularly during periods of sharp price movements in the silver market.\n\n“A significant difference from NAV may indicate either a short-term constraint in supply or a high level of speculation,” said Jhunjhunwala.\n\nAlthough this is not a new development, it points to a rise in retail participation. Retail activity in commodity ETFs typically increases during inflationary periods, risk-off phases and times of rapid price growth, similar to what is seen in gold and silver markets.\n\n“Over time, excess buying pressure usually fades and prices move back towards normal levels. However, investors should remain aware of liquidity conditions, the ease of trading in the underlying market, and the long-term behaviour of commodities compared with ETF prices,” Bansal added.",

        "full_content": "As the Union Budget approaches, corporate India appears to be signalling caution rather than clamour for sweeping tax cuts, with senior executives placing greater emphasis on stability, predictability and simplification of the corporate tax regime.\n\nAccording toMoneycontrol'sMood of India Inc survey, which drew responses from 47 senior executives across sectors, 41.3 percent of respondents expect the government to maintain a “stable corporate tax regime with no changes” in the upcoming Budget. This was the most popular response, underscoring the strategic importance of certainty and stability, as companies plan long-term investments.\n\nAnother 32.6 percent of respondents said the government should focus on “simplifying the tax structure”, particularly by eliminating separate calculations of surcharges and cess.\n\nExecutives said complexity in taxation diverts managerial bandwidth and raises compliance costs, often leading to litigation.\n\n“One single rate with no deductions or exemptions; simplification should be the norm to bring more predictability and less litigation. This will attract investments too,” one executive said.\n\nAnother noted that companies should not be “wasting mindspace, resources and capacity” on navigating multiple layers of taxation, arguing that a simpler system would allow businesses to focus on value creation.\n\nMeanwhile, 26.1 percent of respondents favoured a “moderate reduction in corporate tax rates”.\n\nWhile this group was smaller, executives supporting this view linked lower rates to investment revival, capital inflows and infrastructure creation.\n\n“A moderate reduction in corporate tax rates can further stimulate private investment, attract incremental capital inflows, and support long-term infrastructure creation,” one respondent said, adding that it could also improve India’s competitiveness by reducing economic double taxation.\n\nSome executives also broadened the discussion to capital markets, calling for a moderate reduction in income tax alongside the abolition of long-term capital gains tax on equities and equity-linked instruments to boost growth and investment sentiment.\n\nOverall, the responses suggest that corporate India is not pressing aggressively for immediate tax cuts, but instead wants policy continuity and administrative simplicity.\n\n“A stable and predictable corporate tax regime is more important than short-term reductions, as it enables long-term investment planning and global competitiveness,” one executive said.\n\nThe survey results indicate that as the government balances fiscal prudence with growth priorities, India Inc is looking less for headline-grabbing tax announcements and more for a framework that is predictable, streamlined and investment-friendly.",

        "full_content": "Asian currencies gained as the dollar sank to levels last seen four years ago as investors turned cautious toward the world’s reserve currency amid unpredictable policymaking from Washington.\n\nThe Malaysian ringgit, Thai baht and the South Korean won all appreciated in early Asian trading after the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index slid to its lowest since February 2022 during the US session. The dollar steadied after its biggest fall since April. The greenback’s decline had accelerated after President Donald Trump said he was not concerned about the weakening.\n\nAsian stocks were mixed with South Korea rising and Japan falling. US equity-index futures extended gains as the Wall Street Journal reported SoftBank is in talks to invest up to $30 billion more in OpenAI.\n\nThe dollar’s weakness reflects uncertainty over policy from the Trump administration, including threats to take over Greenland and comments that have raised concerns about the Federal Reserve’s independence. That forms the backdrop as the Fed announces its interest-rate decision Wednesday, just as traders turn their attention to megacap technology earnings.\n\n“The Trump administration is taking a calculated risk,” said Win Thin, chief economist at Bank of Nassau 1982 Ltd. “Foreign exchange typically is the leader in terms of showing market discomfort with a country’s policies and economic outlook, so this dollar weakness bears watching.”\n\nThe latest decline in the dollar also follows signs of US support to boost the yen, reopening speculation around the potential for coordinated currency intervention to guide the greenback lower against key trading partners.\n\nReports from traders Friday indicated that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York contacted financial institutions to check on the yen’s exchange rate — a preliminary step that’s often taken before interventions.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s dollar comments added to an earlier slide in the greenback, which reflected a lack of confidence in the US economy partly due to his erratic tariff policy.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Iowa, Trump said “the dollar is doing great.” When asked if he wants to see the currency decline more, he replied that he could have it go up or down “like a yo-yo.”\n\nIn other corners of the market, gold traded slightly below its record high and silver advanced. West Texas Intermediate crude also edged up. The commodities are all priced in dollars.\n\nTreasuries were a touch stronger with the yield on the 10-year falling one basis point to 4.23% ahead of Wednesday’s Fed meeting. The central bank is projected to halt its rate-cutting cycle as a steadier jobs market restores a degree of consensus among officials after months of growing division.\n\nWith the economy still displaying exceptional strength, the Fed’s messaging is likely to emphasize a data‑driven approach to future policy decisions, according to Chris Brigati at SWBC. Also, the tone from this week’s earnings from the so-called ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech companies should be solid.\n\nAround a third of S&P 500 companies by market capitalization report results this week. Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. report earnings on Wednesday, followed by Apple Inc. on Thursday. Alphabet Inc., by far the best performer among megacaps last year, reports on Feb. 4. Results from Amazon.com Inc. land on Feb. 5 and Nvidia Corp.’s on Feb. 25.\n\n“This week is pivotal in setting the market’s near‑term tone as 2026 progresses,” Brigati noted. “History shows that a strong January often frames the narrative for the rest of the year, with investor psychology playing an outsized role.”",

        "full_content": "Indian Inc is somewhat confident that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will be able to control inflation at the medium-term target of 4 percent, a Moneycontrol-Deloitte Survey of 45 chief executive officers (CEOs) has found.\n\nAccording to the survey, 46.7 percent are somewhat confident, while 15.6 percent are very confident on the central bank controlling inflation at 4 percent.\n\nThe RBI targets an inflation rate of 4 percent, with 6 percent and 2 percent as the upper and lower tolerance bands.\n\nThe Moneycontrol- Deloitte CXO survey was conducted byMoneycontroland Deloitte between December 2025 and January 2026.\n\nThe survey includes CXOs from across industries, such as banking and insurance; manufacturing; transport and logistics; energy; life sciences and health; telecom and tech and e-commerce. The respondents are representatives of companies across three categories - very large corporates (above Rs 3000 crore); large corporate company (Rs 500 crore to Rs 3000 crore) and MSMEs (Rs 500 crore and below).\n\nA relatively smaller 11.1 percent and remaining CEOs surveyed fell in the \"somewhat concerned\" and \"very concerned\" brackets.\n\nIn December monetary policy, the central bank has revised inflation projection for FY26 to 2 percent from 2.6 percent projected earlier. The Q3 inflation projection was at 0.6 percent as compared to 1.8 percent earlier, and Q4 projected at 2.9 percent as compared to 4.0 percent earlier, and retail inflation for Q1 of the next fiscal is seen at 3.9 percent as compared to 4.5 percent projected earlier, and RBI projects Jul-Sept FY27 CPI inflation at 4%.\n\nOn January 22,Moneycontrolpoll of 14 economists, bank treasury heads and fund managers on RBI policy expectation on rate action in February has found that experts remained divided view on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation projections. This is because, few experts said the central bank may remain in wait and watch mode before revising inflation forecast ahead of the new base year series for GDP and CPI.\n\nIndia’s inflation firmed up in December, rising to a three-month high of 1.33 percent from 0.7 percent in November, government data released on January 12 showed.\n\nEven with the uptick, headline inflation has now stayed below the RBI’s lower tolerance threshold of 2 percent for four consecutive months, underlining how price pressures have cooled meaningfully since the middle of the year.\n\nFor the year as a whole, inflation averaged about 2.2 percent in 2025, making it one of the lowest readings seen in over a decade, helped largely by a sharp easing in food prices.\n\nDecember also marks a transition point for India’s inflation statistics. It is the final consumer price index (CPI) reading under the 2012 base year. Starting with the January print — due on February 12 — the CPI series will shift to a new 2024 base, with an updated consumption basket that includes more items and assigns a higher weight to non-food components.\n\nThe change is significant because the current CPI is heavily food-weighted, with food accounting for more than half of the index. This makes headline inflation highly volatile, as sharp swings in vegetables, cereals or pulses can move the overall number even when non-food prices remain stable.",

        "full_content": "As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, investors are growing increasingly nervous about the possibility of further changes to capital gains taxation at a time when equity markets are already fragile.\n\nThe concern is not driven by any formal proposal, but by the broader market context: volatile equities, sustained foreign investor selling and lingering unease after tax hikes introduced in 2024. Market participants say even the perception that equity taxation could be pushed closer to marginal income tax rates is amplifying anxiety.\n\nThe fear is less about a headline hike and more about structural shifts that could quietly alter behaviour. These include aligning equity gains with income-tax slabs, frequent changes to holding periods, or raising the burden on short-term trades without reviewing the securities transaction tax.\n\nThis debate is unfolding against an already layered tax framework, where investors face capital gains tax, STT and currency depreciation pressures at the same time.\n\n2024 Changes Still Casting a Shadow\n\nBudget 2024 raised long-term capital gains tax to 12.5 percent, removed indexation benefits for new investments and increased short-term capital gains tax to 20 percent. While markets initially absorbed the changes during a strong rally, corrections later in the year dragged sentiment lower and kept the Nifty largely range-bound through 2025.\n\n“When long-term capital gains were raised from 10 percent to 12.5 percent in July 2024, foreign investors were unhappy,” said Tushar Sachde, tax partner at PwC. “Will the government change rates again within a year? The consensus is that it is unlikely.”\n\nStill, with 2026 beginning on a volatile note and foreign portfolio investors continuing to sell, investors are reassessing whether the higher tax burden is beginning to bite at the wrong point in the cycle.\n\n“Foreign investors look at post-tax returns,” Sachde said. “With higher taxes and the rupee moving closer to 92, they’ve effectively been hit on both counts.”\n\nRisk of Sell-Off if Taxes Rise Further\n\nTejas Khoday, co-founder and managing director at Fyers, said the current framework has already stretched market participants. “The system has overshot for active traders,” he said. “Any hike from here could trigger a sharp sell-off because it disincentivises equity investors to stay invested, especially when markets are not delivering returns.”\n\nMarket participants stress the issue is not whether equities should be taxed. They already are. The concern is about direction.\n\nAfter successive changes, investors are trying to assess whether the government sees the current regime as settled or as a step toward treating capital gains more like regular income.\n\n“Frequent tinkering creates instability,” Khoday said. “What markets need is long-term predictability.”\n\nSatwik Jain of Generational Capital pointed to the cumulative impact of overlapping levies.\n\n“STT was introduced in lieu of long-term capital gains. Now you have both,” he said. “Add currency depreciation to that, and post-tax returns get squeezed. Even a directional signal like reducing STT would be taken very positively.”\n\nMarket participants argue layered taxation combined with currency weakness is hurting risk appetite, particularly for foreign investors and active domestic traders.\n\nFrom the government’s perspective, capital gains remain an important revenue source. A large share of gains accrue to higher-income investors, strengthening the argument that passive income should not enjoy large tax advantages over salaries.\n\nAt the same time, welfare commitments and infrastructure spending leave limited room for large concessions.\n\n“There is limited fiscal headroom,” said PwC’s Sachde. “Any relief has to be weighed against revenue considerations.”\n\nHowever, experts warn that aggressive tax tightening could be counterproductive at a time when markets are central to household financialisation, IPO funding and the government’s own divestment plans.\n\nIncremental Tweaks More Likely\n\nMost market participants expect incremental changes rather than sweeping reform. These could include a review of STT, rationalisation between short- and long-term rates or structural simplification without raising headline taxes.\n\n“STT is almost unique to India. It taxes participation, not profits,” Khoday said. “If you want to widen participation, you need to reduce STT and avoid raising capital gains further.”\n\nThere is also a growing call for policy stability.\n\n“Taxation has become a key issue for foreign investors,” Khoday said. “Most countries don’t tax portfolio investors the way India does. Any further increase becomes a deterrent when post-tax returns are already under pressure.”\n\nTrivesh D of Tradejini said even partial relief could help sentiment. “Simplification rather than tightening should be the focus. Reducing STT or easing short-term capital gains could improve risk appetite without distorting long-term investment behaviour.”\n\nMarkets may have absorbed the 2024 changes, but patience is thinning. What investors want ahead of Budget 2026 is clarity, stability and fewer negative surprises.",

        "full_content": "Indian equity markets head into the Union Budget with cautious positioning and rising sensitivity to policy signals. With Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman set to present the FY27 Budget on February 1, benchmark indices remain locked in a pre-event consolidation phase, reflecting a market that is waiting for clarity rather than chasing momentum.\n\nThe Nifty has largely traded in a narrow range amid a volatile global backdrop marked by renewed tariff risks under a potential Trump 2.0 presidency and persistent geopolitical tensions.\n\nDomestically, growth expectations for FY26 hover between 6.5 and 7 percent, while investors are closely tracking how the government balances fiscal consolidation with the need to sustain economic momentum.\n\nThat trade-off becomes even more critical after FY26, when the Centre committed a capital expenditure outlay of Rs 11.21 lakh crore, roughly 3.1 percent of GDP, representing a nearly 10 percent increase over earlier estimates. With volatility already elevated, markets are increasingly focused on execution rather than intent, making the upcoming Budget a potential inflection point for sentiment.\n\n1) Bigger Infrastructure-Led Capex Push\n\nA sharper-than-expected increase in capital expenditure, in the range of 10 to 15 percent, taking total capex to Rs 12 to 12.5 lakh crore, or around 3.2 percent of GDP, with a strong focus on infrastructure, could emerge as the single biggest positive trigger for markets.\n\nTejas Khoday said infrastructure spending is no longer optional. “If the government meaningfully increases capital expenditure, particularly in infrastructure, it can immediately lift sentiment because this is where India’s biggest bottlenecks lie,” he said. “For manufacturing to become globally competitive, capex needs to rise sharply. Without sustained spending on roads, railways, ports and maritime routes, the ecosystem simply doesn’t scale.”\n\nRanjit Jha added that public sector investment often sets the tone for the broader cycle. “When the government leads on capex, private players gain confidence and that’s when markets respond,” he said.\n\nPublic capex is widely estimated to have a multiplier effect of 1.5 to 2 times on GDP, while also reducing logistics costs that remain elevated compared to peers such as China. Strong execution visibility typically benefits cyclical sectors such as cement, steel, capital goods and construction, supporting broader sector re-rating.\n\n2) Targeted Push for High-Growth Strategic Sectors\n\nMarkets are also watching for sharper policy focus and higher budgetary allocations toward long-term structural growth themes. Above-trend spending on defence, clean energy, railways, AI, data centres, manufacturing and R&D, along with refinements to PLI schemes and FDI norms tied to technology transfer, could revive thematic momentum.\n\nVikas Gupta outlined where expectations are building. “Defence, railways, clean energy, infrastructure, housing, AI, strategic minerals and manufacturing linked to technology transfer are all likely focus areas,” he said. “Sectors aligned with these themes tend to see heightened activity around the budget, especially if allocations surprise on the upside.”\n\nKhoday added that innovation-led industries require sustained policy backing. “Incentivising and subsidising R&D can have a direct impact on sectors like IT and pharma,” he said, arguing that targeted support could help companies move up the value chain instead of competing purely on cost.\n\n3) Measures That Put More Money in Consumers’ Hands\n\nWhile capex supports medium-term growth, near-term market sentiment continues to hinge on consumption recovery. Any move that boosts disposable income, whether through a higher standard deduction, modest slab rationalisation or better-targeted transfers, could revive demand across FMCG, auto and retail sectors.\n\nUnlike indirect measures such as GST rationalisation, markets are looking for direct income-side relief that translates into immediate spending power.\n\nRanjit Jha put it succinctly: “If the government pumps money into the hands of common people, demand automatically follows,” he said, pointing to consumption as the missing link in the current recovery cycle.\n\n4) Capital Gains Tax Stability\n\nFor equities, sometimes the strongest positive trigger is the absence of negative surprises. Clear signals of stability on capital gains tax and Securities Transaction Tax, along with any simplification or marginal relief, could play a critical role in sustaining domestic investor confidence.\n\nKhoday cautioned against using capital markets as a revenue lever. “The biggest impediment to growth would be further taxing the capital market ecosystem,” he said. “Adding stress here risks demoralising investors and weakening India’s capital formation engine. Ultimately, it is domestic investors who fund Indian companies, and that flow needs stability, not uncertainty.”\n\nWith foreign investors still selective, domestic mutual fund flows and retail participation have become the backbone of market liquidity. Tax predictability helps preserve risk appetite and valuation support in a market that is no longer cheap.\n\n5) Export and Trade Support Through Customs Rationalisation\n\nAs global supply chains continue to realign, any push on trade facilitation through customs duty rationalisation, export incentives or progress on strategic bilateral agreements could provide a boost to export-oriented sectors.\n\nRanjit Jha highlighted several emerging opportunities, citing growing momentum around EU-India engagement, expanding defence cooperation with the UAE and disruptions in competing export hubs such as Bangladesh’s textile industry. “These are openings India can capitalise on, provided policy support aligns,” he said.\n\nWith global growth remaining uneven, India’s attractiveness as a manufacturing and export base improves when input costs fall and trade access expands. Export-linked sectors such as textiles, gems and jewellery and defence manufacturing stand to benefit both on margins and volumes.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
