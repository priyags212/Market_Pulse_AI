        "full_content": " Indian markets erased part of the previous week’s losses to close about 1% higher ahead of the Union Budget. The week remained volatile, driven by sustained FII outflows, DII support, delays in the India–US trade deal, rising geopolitical tensions, mixed corporate earnings, a weakening rupee, and a cautious outlook from the US Federal Reserve after it kept interest rates unchanged. The BSE Sensex climbed 732.08 points, or 0.89%, to close at 82,269.78, while the Nifty50 advanced 272 points, or 1.08%, to settle at 25,320.65. The BSE Large-cap index gained 1.3 percent, driven by strong rallies in ABB India, Siemens Energy India, Vodafone Idea, Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, and Adani Green Energy, which rose between 10 and 18 percent. However, Asian Paints, Hindustan Zinc, Berger Paints India, Godrej Consumer Products, and Maruti Suzuki India were among the laggards. The Nifty Mid-cap index rose 2 percent, led by gains in GE Vernova TD India, Oil India, Hitachi Energy India, Aegis Vopak Terminals, Cochin Shipyard, Gillette India, Jindal Stainless, Star Health &amp; Allied Insurance Company, and Relaxo Footwears. On the other hand, key losers included KPIT Technologies, Inventurus Knowledge Solutions, Laurus Labs, Bharti Hexacom, Balkrishna Industries, and Emami. The BSE Small-cap index jumped 3 percent, led by sharp gains in Sharda Cropchem, Hindustan Copper, MIC Electronics, SPEL Semiconductor, Panorama Studios International, JITF Infralogistics, Mahindra Logistics, Moschip Technologies, Walchandnagar Industries, Garden Reach Shipbuilders &amp; Engineers, Manorama Industries, MTAR Technologies, Data Patterns (India), Punjab Chemicals &amp; Crop Protection, Sterlite Technologies, and Taneja Aerospace and Aviation, all of which surged more than 20 percent each. Meanwhile, Vimta Labs, Sri Adhikari Brothers Television, OneSource Specialty Pharma, IFB Industries, South Indian Bank, SBFC Finance, and Best Agrolife declined over 15 percent Among sectors, the Nifty Defence index outperformed with a nearly 9 percent gain, followed by Nifty Energy, which rose 6 percent. The Nifty Oil &amp; Gas index added 4 percent, while the Nifty Realty and Metal indices climbed 3 percent each. On the other hand, the Nifty IT, FMCG, and Healthcare indices declined by 0.5 percent each. During the week, State Bank of India added the most to market capitalisation, followed by Axis Bank, Bharat Electronics, and Larsen &amp; Toubro. In contrast, Maruti Suzuki India, Asian Paints, and Kotak Mahindra Bank witnessed a decline in their market value. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) turned buyers on Friday, purchasing equities worth Rs 2,251 crore. However, they remained net sellers for the week, having offloaded shares worth Rs 730 crore. Meanwhile, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) continued their support, buying equities worth Rs 14,398.03 crore. The Indian rupee remained under pressure for the third consecutive week, hitting a fresh record low of 92.01. It closed 3 paise lower at 91.99 per dollar on January 30, compared with 91.96 on January 23, and traded in a range of 91.52–92.01 during the period.",

        "full_content": "As Budget 2026 approaches, India’s metals industry enters the new fiscal year with a rare combination of visibility and vulnerability. Demand outlook remains firm, supported by government-led infrastructure spending and the energy transition. Yet, rising costs, import dependence and policy uncertainty continue to weigh on competitiveness, sharpening expectations from this year’s Budget.\n\nThe Economic Survey projects steel demand growth of 9-10 percent, anchored by capital expenditure of Rs 11 lakh crore, equivalent to 3.2 percent of GDP. Roads, railways, including 5,364 km of high-speed corridors, and urban housing together account for nearly 69 percent of steel consumption. This trajectory aligns with India’s ambition to scale steel capacity to 300 million tonnes by 2030.\n\nBeyond steel, aluminium and copper demand is expanding alongside electric vehicle infrastructure, renewable energy targets of 500 GW and the rapid rollout of solar parks. Industry experts say, with India already ranking among the top three global solar markets, metal intensity across power and mobility infrastructure is set to rise steadily.\n\nCosts and supply risks dominate expectations\n\nDespite this demand momentum, cost pressures remain acute. India continues to import 100percent  of critical minerals such as lithium and cobalt, leaving producers exposed to global volatility. Low beneficiation rates, under 20percent  for iron ore compared to global norms of around 80percent ,further force reliance on high-grade imports, often at premiums of Rs 5,000 to Rs 7,000 per ton.\n\nLt Col Rochak Bakshi (Retd), CFP, says \"Budget 2026 could address some of these challenges through duty rationalisation. Rationalising import duties to zero on critical minerals like lithium and cobalt could help reduce dependency and ease cost pressures.”\n\nIn addition, mining royalties ranging from 15 percent to 18 percent contribute to double taxation, translating into effective cost increases of nearly 25 percent in the absence of reform. The industry is also seeking a mining policy overhaul that allows greater private participation in copper and silver extraction to improve domestic supply security.\n\nBalancing protection and competitiveness\n\nThe debate over safeguard duties has resurfaced, particularly in the steel sector, amid concerns over dumping. However, the Economic Survey cautions that excessive protectionism could inflate industrial costs and weaken downstream competitiveness.\n\nBakshi warns that delayed reforms may worsen raw material shortages just as demand accelerates. “Over-protectionism risks raising costs and eroding competitiveness at a time when global supply risks are already elevated,” he says.\n\nWhy policy stability matters in Budget 2026\n\nPolicy predictability emerges as a broader theme across metals, including gold. Mahendra Luniya, Founder and Chairman of Vighnaharta Gold Ltd, points out \"frequent changes in import duties tend to distort domestic pricing without reducing demand. A stable and rational duty framework would bring predictability and align domestic prices more closely with global benchmarks.\"\n\nLuniya adds, \"encouraging formal, traceable gold investments, such as regulated and digital gold, can channel household savings into the formal economy while maintaining demand sentiment.\"\n\nFor the metals industry as a whole, Budget 2026 is less about announcements and more about execution. With demand already locked in, the sector is looking for cost rationalisation, mining reforms and stable policy signals that allow Indian metal producers to grow competitively in an increasingly uncertain global environment.",

        "full_content": "Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on Friday as investors viewed President Donald Trump's nomination of former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh as a hawkish choice to succeed Federal Reserve Chair ​Jerome Powell, while also digesting earnings reports and a high inflation reading.\n\nOn top of assessing the risks from U.S. tensions with countries including Iran, investors were also worried about ‌the prospect of another U.S. government shutdown after new barriers emerged in the Senate to a deal that would ensure continuation of funding for agency operations.\n\nAt the Fed, Warsh, 55, is expected to favor lower interest rates but stop short of the more aggressive monetary easing linked to some other potential nominees. With Powell's term ending in May, Warsh, if confirmed by the Senate, would take the helm of a central bank he has argued should scale back its role in the economy and rethink its approach to monetary policy.\n\n\"Markets are calibrating to Trump's pick of Kevin Warsh ... and the outlook for monetary policy,\" said Michael Hans, chief investment officer at ‌Citizens Wealth, who also pointed to an unwinding of recent trading patterns with the U.S. dollar gaining ground on Friday and precious metals selling off sharply.\n\nMeanwhile, ​in earnings, Apple shares regained ground to close up 0.4% after earlier losses a day after the iPhone maker released quarterly results. On the data front, producer prices increased more than expected in December, suggesting inflation could pick up in the months ahead.\n\n\"There's a combination of investor concerns around the Fed chair announcement, some mixed tech earnings and lingering inflation pressure as well as some uncertainty about a potential government ‍shutdown even though it should be short-lived,\" said Angelo Kourkafas, senior global strategist at Edward Jones.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 179.09 points, or 0.36%, to 48,892.47, the S&P 500 lost 29.98 points, or 0.43%, to 6,939.03 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 223.30 points, or 0.94%, to 23,461.82.\n\nThe rate-sensitive, small-cap Russell 2000 index has recently been outperforming large-cap indexes but on Friday it lagged with a 1.6% loss for the day.\n\nBut the Russell 2000 ended the month up ⁠more than 5%, compared with monthly advances of 1.4% for the S&P 500 and 0.9% for the Nasdaq. The Dow, meanwhile, climbed 1.7% for January, to notch a ninth consecutive monthly advance, its longest ‍winning streak since 2018.\n\nFor the week, the S&P 500 rose 0.3%, the Dow fell 0.4% and the Nasdaq fell 0.2%.\n\nThe S&P's Materials index led declines among the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors, with a 1.9% loss, ‌as U.S.-listed gold ‌and silver miners tumbled in sympathy with the massive selloff in gold prices and in silver.\n\nDefensive consumer staples was the sector with the biggest advance on the day, rising 1.4%. Colgate-Palmolive (CL.N), opens new tab was its biggest gainer, closing up 5.9%, after the maker of toothpaste and soap forecast annual sales above Wall Street estimates on steady demand for household staples in markets such as Latin America and Europe.\n\nInvestors have given a mixed reception to megacap earnings reports this week with a stark warning that record capital‑spending binges will be tolerated as long as the growth keeps coming.\n\nApple wrapped up the week with a forecast of higher-than-expected revenue growth of ⁠up to 16% for the March quarter, but ⁠warned that rising memory-chip prices had started ​to pressure profitability.\n\nMicrosoft ended down 0.7% on Friday after falling 10% on Thursday for its deepest daily loss since March 2020 after its cloud revenue failed to impress. Meta shares closed 3% lower on Friday.\n\nAfter falling on Thursday following its results, Tesla shares rose 3.3% on Friday, providing the S&P 500 with its biggest boost, after reports that SpaceX is exploring deals with the electric-vehicle maker and other companies run by Elon Musk.\n\nVerizon Communications was the ‍S&P 500's second-biggest boost, finishing up 11.8% after it forecast annual profit and free cash flow above market expectations on Friday, after aggressive promotions during the peak holiday period fueled its highest quarterly wireless subscriber additions in six years.\n\nSanDisk shares rallied 6.9% after a better-than-expected third-quarter forecast as AI fuels storage demand. But KLA Corp shares tumbled 15.2% even after the company beat Wall Street expectations for second-quarter profit and revenue.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.59-to-1 ratio on the NYSE ​where there were 247 new highs and 154 new lows. On the Nasdaq, 1,599 stocks rose and 3,222 fell as ‍declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.02-to-1 ratio.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 19 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 72 new highs and 205 new lows.\n\nOn U.S. exchanges, 23.88 billion shares changed hands compared with the 19.42 ​billion moving average for the last 20 trading sessions.",

        "full_content": "As FM Nirmala Sitharaman prepares to present the Budget, India is framing its growth strategy against a turbulent global backdrop, one where there are new global realignments and partnerships. With capital flows to emerging markets turning increasingly selective, policymakers are expected to rely on domestic growth engines like consumption, investment and structural reforms.\n\nGlobally, the outlook remains volatile. Commodity markets have seen sharp swings, with metals and precious metals rallying on supply concerns and safe-haven demand. At the same time, tighter global financial conditions and valuation concerns have made portfolio flows more volatile, increasing the importance of credible macro policy and stable growth visibility.\n\nDomestically, India enters the Budget season on a relatively firm footing. Private consumption has been resilient, supported by improving urban demand and a gradual recovery in rural spending. The Budget is expected to support demand through tax simplification and targeted relief measures rather than large fiscal giveaways.\n\nGST rationalisation remains another important growth lever. Recent rate restructuring has reduced complexity.\n\nOn the direct tax side, expectations are centred on income tax simplification rather than aggressive rate cuts. Potential measures include a higher standard deduction, further rationalisation of slabs under the new tax regime and consolidation of multiple TDS provisions. The government could consider either doing away with STT or Capital gains tax to avoid double taxation and simplify the regime.\n\nDividend income at present faces “onerous” double taxation whereby companies pay taxes on profits, then investors pay again on the dividend income. There is a possibility of moving back to a zero tax or a flat 10% dividend tax regime similar to the earlier practice.\n\nInvestment is expected to be a key growth pillar. Public capital expenditure is likely to stay elevated, with continued focus on infrastructure such as roads, railways, power, logistics and urban development. Beyond supporting near-term demand, sustained public capex has improved the investment climate by reducing logistics costs and easing supply bottlenecks. The Budget is also expected to focus on private capex, leveraging healthier corporate balance sheets through better PPP frameworks and credit facilitation.\n\nPolicymakers should also shift focus from capex alone to innovation-led growth, with targeted R&D incentives. This is critical for pharma, defence, and BFSI, helping India move up the value chain, deepen indigenisation, and broaden market participation while supporting long-term productivity and export competitiveness.\n\nSimplification of FPIs compliance is emerging as an important reform lever amid volatile portfolio flows. After net equity outflows in FY25 and FY26, to improve ease of participation and stabilise foreign capital flows, we believe India should address current outstanding ambiguities around trade, regulations, and tax-related matters.\n\nWhile recently, overseas inflows have been tepid, India’s growth alpha over other global economies and stable macro fundamentals make it a natural candidate to be a recipient of overseas flows, once geopolitical tensions subside.\n\nManufacturing is set to remain central to the medium-term strategy. The emphasis is gradually shifting from capacity creation to building robust ecosystems, deeper supply chains, higher domestic value addition, better logistics and skilling to support exports and employment.\n\nOverall, Budget 2026–27 should prioritise continuity and execution. In an uncertain global environment, India’s ability to rely on resilient consumption, sustained investment, and incremental but credible reforms could once again underpin its competitive advantage and growth.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "Bengaluru-based developer Roy Chiriankandath Joseph, better known as CJ Roy, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his home in the city on January 30, during an Income Tax raid there. His death culminates in a two decade journey of working at large firms, and making it as an entrepreneur with his real estate firm Confident Group, with his life criss-crossing cinema, and a jet-setting lifestyle.\n\nA former employee at corporates such as BPL, Hewlett-Packard, and others, his venture into real estate through a land parcel in Sarjapura turned out to be a multi-bagger, and his near-two decade empire resulted in considerable name and fame even beyond homes, becoming a large film producer as well.\n\nThat fame, including associations with Malayali cinema's leading man Mohanlal, brought him a large following on social media, with 1.3 million followers on Instagram. Roy was known to be conspicuous with his wealth, often parading his sports cars to his followers, from a Rolls-Royce to a Bugatti, both in India and at his base in Dubai, which he often referred to as his home. According to industry insiders, Roy has a considerable empire in Dubai as well, largely looked after by his son.\n\nThe group constructed more than 40 million square feet in real estate across his target markets. And in Bengaluru, where he started his business, he has increasingly taken the joint development route, with the group targeting 1,000 acres in joint development projects. In 2025, the group is developing around 412 acres through the \"asset-light\" route.\n\nBesides his ventures in the Bengaluru, and in the UAE, markets, Roy, a native of Kerala, invested considerably in his home state, as wealth flowing from the state's significant diaspora made for ripe pickings. His interests, mainly apartment projects in the mid-premium categories, but also bungalows and plots, remained in the state's capital Thiruvananthapuram, the state's largest city Kochi, as well as major district headquarters such as Thrissur and Kozhikode.\n\nAll told, the group has as many as 50 projects in Kerala, according to the Kerala Real Estate Regulatory Authority (KRERA), many of them being under construction.\n\nHis association with his home state extended to major films, even \"rescuing\" film projects stuck in development hell. With Mohanlal, Roy produced films such as Casanovva in 2012, which did moderately at the box office. Roy was one of the producers of the historical epic Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham in 2021, where Mohanlal played the titular role. Like Casanovva, Marakkar also did moderately in theatres, despite the hype and the large production budget.\n\nRoy had more luck in recent years in Malayali cinema, as well as in the Karnataka film industry, with films such as Identity, starring Tovino Thomas and Trisha Krishnan, being one of the highest grossers in the Malayali film industry for 2025. Besides films, Roy sponsored the Malayalam edition of the reality show Bigg Boss, and held an honorary role as a consul of Slovakia.\n\nThe Confident Group was not available for comment on the story. In a post on social media, the company mourned Roy's death, saying that his vision for the group lives on.",

The greenback’s rally undercut sentiment among investors who had been piling into metals after the president signaled a willingness to let the currency weaken.\n\nGold’s move “validates the cautionary tale of fast-up, fast-down,” said Christopher Wong, a strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. While reports of Warsh’s nomination were a trigger, a correction was overdue, he said. “It’s like one of those excuses markets are waiting for to unwind those parabolic moves.”\n\nPrecious metals had already been primed for extreme moves, as soaring prices and volatility strained traders’ risk models and balance sheets. A record wave of purchases of call options, contracts which give holders the right to buy at a pre-determined price, had also “mechanically reinforcing upward price momentum,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a note, as the sellers of the options hedged their exposure to rising prices by buying more.\n\nBullion’s slide may have been accelerated by a so-called gamma squeeze. That’s where dealers that are short options need to buy more futures — or shares in the case of the gold exchange-traded funds — as prices rise through levels of large options holdings and sell as they fall back through, to keep their portfolios balanced. For the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, there were large positions expiring Friday at $465 and $455, while on Comex, sizable March and April options positions were at $5,300, $5,200 and $5,100.\n\nThe metals rout also drove down shares of major mining companies including top gold producers Newmont Corp., Barrick Mining Corp. and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd., whose shares had slid more than 8% in New York trading.\n\nEven after the pullback, gold is still up around 18% in January, closing in on its sharpest monthly gain since 1980. The jump in silver has been eye-watering, with the white metal up more than 40% so far this year.\n\nThe extent of the correction “suggests that market participants were simply waiting for an opportunity to take profits after the rapid price rise,” analysts in Commerzbank AG wrote in a note Friday. Still, while rumours of Warsh’s appointment may have triggered the fall, there is a high probability that the Fed “will yield to pressure to at least some extent and cut interest rates more than is currently priced in by the market,” Commerzbank said.\n\nWith gold and silver jumping so much already this year, some technical indicators flashed warning signs. One is the relative-strength index, which in recent weeks signaled that both metals may have become overbought and due a correction. Gold’s RSI recently hit 90, the highest it has been for the precious metal in decades.\n\nVolatility is very extreme and both psychological resistance levels of $5,000 and $100 respectively have been broken numerous times on Friday, according to Dominik Sperzel, head of trading at Heraeus Precious Metals. “We need to prepare for the roller-coaster to continue though.”\n\nChinese investors have led the charge, buying in such force that it prompted the Shanghai Futures Exchange to rush out measures to cool the surge in precious and industrial metal markets.\n\nPresidentDonald Trumpsaid he intends to nominate Warsh to be the next chair of the Fed in a post on Friday. The former Fed governor has a longstanding reputation as an inflation hawk, but has aligned himself with the president in recent months by arguing publicly for lower interest rates. Trump said he would announce his nominee on Friday morning US time.\n\nMeanwhile, the risk of another US government shutdown was avoided after Trump and Senate Democrats reached a tentative deal. The White House is continuing to negotiate with Democrats on placing new limits on immigration raids that have provoked a national outcry.\n\nSpot gold fell 7.4% to $4,977.06 an ounce as of 11:53 a.m. in New York. Silver plunged 20% to $92.96 an ounce, while platinum and palladium also tumbled. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index gained 0.6%",

        "full_content": "The dearness allowance for the central government employees is set to be raised by 5 percent, taking the overall hike to 63 percent, as the Ministry of Labour and Employment retained the AICPI-IW index at 148.2 for December 2025.\n\nThe All India Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers is a key input for revising dearness allowance for central government employees and pensioners to safeguard salaries and pensions from the impact of inflation.\n\n“With the Centre keeping the AICPI-IW index unchanged at 148.2, the dearness allowance will be raised by 5 percent. This means the DA will be hiked 63 percent,” said Manjeet Singh Patel, president of the All India NPS Employees Federation.\n\nThe revision of dearness allowance is due in January 2026 as part of the biannual cycle. The government had increased DA from 54 percent to 58 percent in July 2025.\n\nFollowing the routine practice, the Centre will likely implement the hike in DA for central government employees in March-April 2026. Employees can hope to receive their DA hike in April’s salary, which will cover the arrears from January 2026.\n\nHow is central government DA calculated?\n\nAccording to Patel, with December’s AICPI-IW at 148.2, the central government employees will see the hike in DA be raised by 5%, from the current 58 percent to 63 percent.\n\nDA (%) = [{(Average AICPI-IW of last 12 months × 2.88) − 261.41} / 261.41​] × 100 − Existing DA (%)\n\nWhat about the transport allowance hike?\n\nWhenever the Centre implements the dearness allowance, the transport allowance is also raised by the same percentage.\n\nThe 7th Pay Commission determined thattransport allowance for central government employeesdepends on their pay level and the category of city where they are posted. Cities are classified into three groups—X, Y and Z—with X-category cities attracting higher transport allowance than Y and Z.\n\nThe allowance is paid as a fixed monthly amount, with dearness allowance added to it. In addition, employees at Level 14 and above who are eligible for an official car but choose not to use it receive Rs 15,750 per month, while employees with disabilities are entitled to twice the applicable transport allowance.\n\nLet’s take an example of the central government employee in Pay Level 5 posted in a Y-category city who draws a base transport allowance of Rs 1,800. When the dearness allowance is raised to 63 percent, his transport allowance will increase by Rs 1,134, taking the total to Rs 2,934.\n\nEmployee bodies call for merger of DA with basic pay\n\nSeveral organisations representing government employees have been calling for the merger of dearness allowance with basic pay since the government announced the terms of reference for the8th Pay Commissionin early November.\n\n“Employees are eagerly awaiting immediate relief, and the government should consider merging the existing DA with basic pay. With DA already trailing inflation and gold prices continuing to surge, such a move would offer much-needed support,” said Patel.\n\nThat being said, the Centre earlier clarified that there hasn’t been a proposal tomerge dearness allowance with the basic pay, as an intermediate relief measure for central government employees.\n\n“No proposal regarding merger of the existing dearness allowance with the basic is under consideration with the government at present,” Pankaj Chaudhary, minister of state in the Ministry of Finance, told Lok Sabha in a written reply dated December 1, 2025.",

Similarly, credit cost fell to 0.8% in Q3FY26 from the peak of 2.3% in Q4FY25.\n\nWe believe that most positives are already factored in at CMP as the stock is trading at 3.2x FY27E PBV.

The company has rolled out a series of new product launches, including Colgate Total, Colgate Visible through dental professionals, all of which are currently expanding their distribution footprint in India.\n\n\"Underlying demand in India, mostly in the low-income urban consumer, continues to be rather soft. Our focus, strategy and innovation are really to grow the premium side of the business in the urban market,\" said Noel Wallace, chief executive officer of Colgate Palmolive told analysts in a post earnings call on January 30.\n\nIn the December quarter, Colgate posted an 1.66 per cent rise in sales at Rs Rs 1,486.13 crore, while net profit was flat at Rs  323.86 crore.\n\nAlongside premiumisation, Colgate is also working through the impact of recent GST-related changes, which had affected execution. The management said it is largely past these disruptions and expects execution to improve going forward.\n\n\"We believe the GST rate cut is an enabler, with Colgate having passed on the benefits to consumers; this will help arrest volume pressure in the near term and drive volume growth in the medium term,\" analysts at Emkay wrote in a note dated January 30.\n\nLooking ahead, the company said it has a strong plan for 2026, building on several changes and interventions implemented in 2025, which it expects will translate into a much stronger year for the India business\n\n\"Our concerns about a single-category company with elevated margin levels continue, with Colgate India dealing with competitive stress and macro hiccups in its topline performance. The GST cut, though, is likely to help demand with affordability; however, we see the benefit to be limited for Colgate, as premiumization and a ‘twice brushing’ habit will call for high media spending and innovations ahead,\" Emkay added.",

        "full_content": "As the Union Budget 2026 draws near, India’s real estate sector has urged the government to grant the sector an industry status, digitise land records and introduce a simplified single-window clearance mechanism to accelerate approvals and revive demand.\n\nIndustry bodies and developers argue that recognising real estate as an “industry” would unlock cheaper long-term institutional credit, lower borrowing costs and broader access to structured financing.\n\nDevelopers said that industry status has been a long-pending demand and they remain optimistic, expecting sustained policy support in the budget. The status has also been sought due to a consolidation in the market towards larger developers, driven by factors such as the Real Estate Regulatory Act (RERA), Goods and Services Tax, and Union and state-level housing policies.\n\n“The real estate sector currently contributes around 7 percent to India’s GDP and supports over 200 allied industries. Granting industry status to real estate sector would improve access to institutional funding and enable the sector to play a stronger role in job creation and economic growth. Real estate has the potential to contribute up to 15 percent to India’s GDP by 2047 with the help of adequate policy support,”  Signature Global (India) Ltd founder and chairman Pradeep Aggarwal has said.\n\nTribeca Developers group CEO Rajat Khandelwal said the sector is looking for policy continuity that supports both supply and demand. “Granting industry status to real estate remains crucial, as it would ease access to long-term capital; lower borrowing costs, and improve execution efficiency for developers,” he said.\n\nKhandelwal said real estate growth is closely tied to infrastructure. Increased investments in urban infrastructure, public transport and smart city initiatives will not only make cities liveable but also strengthen the realty sector. Major real estate projects have developed around metro corridors, owing to incentives related to transit-oriented development.\n\nSterling Developers chairman and managing director Ramani Sastri said industry status will help the real estate sector realise its full potential, as it will unlock affordable funding and streamline regulatory processes.\n\n“Overall, we would like to see announcements to enhance ease of doing business for the developers to create positive climate for real estate investment,” he said.\n\nSingle-window clearance and digitisation of land records\n\nDevelopers have also sought single-window clearances, consolidating approvals from multiple authorities on a unified digital platform. It will cut the red tape, reduce project gestation periods and enhance transparency, they have argued.\n\nTRG Group MD Shorab Upadhyay said realtors are looking forward to a Union Budget that brings in stability, liquidity and confidence in the real estate sector.\n\n“We expect better policy support towards faster project approvals, single-window clearances, and digitisation of land records, which are much-needed steps in substantially enhancing ease of doing business and accelerating delivery timelines,” he said.\n\nNotandas Realty managing director Harsh Jagwani said a single-window clearance system is “long overdue” and capable of accelerating approvals and injecting much-needed efficiency into project execution.\n\nThe government should also bring reforms in the digitisation process of land as well as property acquisition. “This will not only help in accelerating the pace of development of new projects but also ease the process of buying new homes for homebuyers in general. Cleaner land-title system, stricter escrow enforcement under RERA will also help reduce transaction risk and financing delays,” he said.",

Hopes are also building for possible expansion of National Pension System (NPS) tax benefits for the elderly, and a comprehensive health scheme covering in-home care.\n\nEmphasis on higher exemption limits\n\nAlthough the Income Tax Act offers several deductions for Indian residents aged 60 and above, the central demand is that the basic exemption limit be raised to ease the tax burden.\n\nCurrently, Section 80TTB under the old tax regime allows resident senior citizens (60–80 years) to claim a deduction of up to Rs 50,000 on interest income from savings and fixed deposits.\n\nOther major expectations include higher exemption limits for medical expenses—under Section 80D for health insurance and critical illness, and Section 80DDB for treatment of specified chronic diseases—along with simplified TDS and TCS norms to cut compliance hassles for seniors.\n\n“An upward revision of exemption thresholds, coupled with simplified slab structures, would provide much-needed relief to pensioners and retirees dependent on fixed incomes,” said Kunal Savani, partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.\n\nTax analysts say many senior citizens have passive income in the form of capital gains, but such profits earned from capital gains aren’t eligible for a tax rebate under Section 87A.\n\n“Given the current scenario of rebate under section 87A, one can expect the government specifically spell out its allowance to senior citizens to avail the rebate on such capital gains, which provides the much-needed relief to such senior taxpayers,” Savani said.\n\nHopes are also building for enhanced pension participation through the National Pension System (NPS), which offers significant tax benefits via deductions under Section 80CCD under both old and new tax regimes.\n\n“Extending tax benefits on NPS contributions under the new tax regime to both salaried and self-employed individuals will help encourage long-term, disciplined retirement savings,” PB Fintech's retirement planning arm Pensionbazaar head Vishwajeet Goel said.\n\nPB Fintec joint group CEO Sarbvir Singh said there is an urgent need for sustained, long-term pension savings and retirement preparedness is emerging as a critical pillar of India’s financial ecosystem.\n\n“The Budget 2026 can encourage disciplined retirement savings by extending NPS tax benefits to both salaried and self-employed individuals. Also, delinking employer participation from the employee’s tax benefit will allow voluntary contributions up to the defined threshold,” Sing said.\n\nA comprehensive scheme for in-home care\n\nOptimism is growing that the Budget 2026 will establish a comprehensive scheme of benefits covering in-home care, assisted living support and transitional care facilities for senior citizens.\n\nAnalysts argue that the biggest cost pressure seniors face is not hospitalisation but prolonged home-based care such as attendants, nursing, physiotherapy and assisted living support, which runs for years and is almost entirely out-of-pocket.\n\n“Budget 2026 can realistically ease this by recognising certified home-care and long-term care expenses as core health costs with a separate, high-limit tax deduction for seniors and their children, instead of forcing families to absorb these recurring costs without any fiscal relief,” said Raheel Patel, partner, Gandhi Law Associates.",

You should be the last person to obtain benefit from the company only after every employee has gotten,” Murthy said in a fireside chat at IIM-Bangalore along with former CEO and MD of HDFC Bank Aditya Puri.\n\nThe session was moderated by M.D. Ranganath, the Chairman of Catamaran Ventures, shines a light on their leadership journeys.\n\nFraming the issue beyond pay alone, Murthy said leaders must consistently demonstrate commitment to organisational values. “In order to keep the memory fresh of the values of the organisation, the leader has to demonstrate his or her commitment to the values from time to time,” he said.\n\nMurthy also recalled Infosys’s early focus on broad-based wealth creation, particularly through employee stock ownership.\n\nHe said the company had distributed stock at an unprecedented scale in India, benefiting employees across levels, from support staff to managers. “The then value of the stock options that we provided was $19 billion on a market capitalization of about $60 billion. That’s almost 30% to the employee… the best peon, the best clerk, the best accountant, the best software manager, every one of them benefited a lot.”\n\nThe Infosys founder highlighted that leadership responsibility extends to safeguarding stakeholder trust, including that of minority shareholders. “A shareholder at large, a minority shareholder, he or she puts either her hard-earned money in your company and if you were to lead a profligate life and blow it up, then you’re not a great human being.”\n\n‘India’s finest entrepreneur post-Independence’\n\nMurthy described legendary banker Aditya Puri as “India’s finest entrepreneur post-Independence,” drawing a contrast between the paths taken by Infosys and HDFC Bank in building scale and influence.\n\n“I call Aditya Puri India’s finest entrepreneur post-Independence,” Murthy. “Infosys focussed on revenues outside India, he succeeded in the Indian environment.”\n\nMurthy highlighted the difference in outcomes by citing market cap: “Infosys is at $70 billion, (while) HDFC is at $180 billion,” he said.\n\nPuri, reflecting on his early awareness of Murthy, said the Infosys founder’s reputation had travelled well beyond India. “i heard about him when I was working in Malaysia,” Puri said, adding that Murthy’s example “inspired me to come back to India.”\n\nFurther, Puri highlighted the need for values and unit level profitability. \"There is no Ebidta or adjusted Ebidta. You're either profitable or you're not, he said",

Since its launch, the initiative has supported over 2,000 startups and facilitated more than 60 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) and international partnerships, officials said.\n\nAlso, read:LEAP, Karnataka’s Rs 1,000 crore startup push to take growth beyond Bengaluru: Priyank Kharge\n\nInformation Technology and Biotechnology Minister Priyank Kharge toldMoneycontrolthat GIA has been designed as Karnataka’s strategic platform for innovation diplomacy. “GIA is linking our startups, research institutions and industry with global innovation hubs. By connecting over 2,000 startups with more than 30 countries, we are creating structured pathways for market access, research collaboration and technology partnerships,” he said. The objective, he added, is to position Karnataka as India’s global gateway for innovation.\n\nAccording to officials, the initiative is structured around three core pillars - government-to-government (G2G) engagement, global expansion for startups, and institution-to-institution (I2I) innovation exchange - enabling policy collaboration, startup market access and joint research under a unified framework.\n\nUnder the G2G pillar, Karnataka has signed MoUs and letters of intent with countries and global innovation hubs including Switzerland, Finland, Berlin, Israel, Chile, Sharjah, New Jersey, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Italy. Going ahead, Karnataka plans to expand GIA’s footprint further across Europe, East Asia and North America, with a sharper focus on DeepTech, AI, climate tech, life sciences and digital infrastructure, officials said.\n\nAlso, read:Karnataka unveils Rs 600-crore-plus plan for DeepTech; explores co-investment model with VCs\n\nStartup globalisation remains a key focus under GIA. “Through GIA Market Access Programme (MAP), Karnataka startups have participated in structured outbound missions to the UAE, Singapore, Belgium, Australia, Germany and Japan. Upcoming programmes are planned in Switzerland, South Korea and France. More than 50 startups across DeepTech, FinTech, HealthTech, CleanTech, Biotech and TravelTech sectors have participated in these cohorts, gaining exposure to international investors, corporates and regulatory ecosystems,” an official said.\n\nOn the research front, the I2I pillar connects Karnataka’s universities and centres of excellence with global academic institutions such as Imperial College London, the University of Glasgow, Rice University, Johns Hopkins University, La Trobe University, and Swissnex with the University of Basel. State-backed institutions including the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Platforms (CCAMP), Science Gallery Bengaluru and Bengaluru Bioinnovation Centre (BBC) are engaged in joint research and startup acceleration programmes.\n\nGIA has also helped establish global innovation corridors with Germany, Finland, Switzerland, the US and Australia, focusing on artificial intelligence, fintech, life sciences, biotechnology, green technologies and Industry 4.0.",

He added, “With SEBI’s approval, we embark on a new chapter of value creation for all our stakeholders. This approval also reinforces confidence in NSE being an integral part of the Indian economy and a beacon of Indian capital markets.”\n\nThe much awaited issue will unlock value for key institutions including LIC, SBI and Stock Holding Corportation.\n\nThe regulatory nod marks a major breakthrough for India’s largest stock exchange, whose IPO plans had been on hold for nearly a decade amid regulatory and governance-related issues. The approval allows NSE to begin formal preparations for the listing, including appointing advisers and filing its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP).\n\nNSE gets key approval for its IPO, settlement to follow in due course\n\nMoneycontrol had reported that SEBI’s clearance comes after NSE undertook a series of steps to address long-pending regulatory concerns, including settlement applications related to legacy cases such as the co-location and dark fibre matters. The exchange has also resolved inspection-related issues in recent months, clearing the way for the regulator’s no-objection certificate.\n\nNSE had first announced plans to go public in 2016, but the proposal was repeatedly delayed as SEBI sought stronger governance standards and closure of outstanding cases. The IPO is expected to be structured largely as an offer for sale.\n\nMarket participants view the approval as a landmark moment for India’s capital markets, given NSE’s central role in equity, derivatives and debt trading. Analysts say the eventual listing could be among the largest in the country and would broaden investor participation in a key market infrastructure institution.\n\nFollowing the approval, NSE said further steps, including settlement processes and regulatory filings, would be taken in due course. The timeline for the IPO will depend on regulatory reviews once the draft documents are submitted.",

Total payment value processed on the platform grew 23 percent year-on-year to Rs 8.5 lakh crore.\n\nThe company said deeper adoption of multiple products contributed to stronger monetisation.\n\nAbout 45 per cent of active members used three or more products on the platform.

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey tabled on January 29 struck an optimistic note on India’s near-term growth prospects, projecting GDP growth of 6.8-7.2 percent in the coming fiscal, well above the IMF’s estimate of 6.4 percent and the World Bank’s forecast of 6.5 percent.\n\nWith retail inflation expected to hover around 4 percent, nominal growth could edge above last year’s estimate of 10.1 percent, creating additional headroom for policy reforms without undermining macro stability.\n\nHere are policy prescriptions for the upcoming budget.\n\nOnce debt and deficit ratios move meaningfully closer to 50 percent and 3 percent of GDP, respectively, the Survey suggests a return to a stricter, rule-based FRBM regime could be considered after the Sixteenth Finance Commission period.\n\nThe Survey makes a strong case for protecting capital expenditure. It argues that capex delivers more durable gains in household incomes by improving infrastructure, lowering transaction costs, crowding in private investment and supporting employment.\n\nOn reviving private investment\n\nThe Survey notes that uncertainty, especially sector-specific regulatory and policy uncertainty, has a disproportionate impact on private capital formation. To address this, it calls for simpler, more predictable regulatory frameworks, targeted deregulation and stable laws, particularly in sectors that are most sensitive to uncertainty shocks.\n\nA notable structural recommendation relates to indigenisation and supply-chain resilience. The Survey outlines a tiered framework that distinguishes between high-urgency sectors requiring rapid domestic scale-up—such as fertiliser inputs, APIs, power electronics and telecom equipment—and strategic core areas like battery cells, magnets and solar wafers, where vulnerability reduction rather than full substitution is the objective.\n\nLower-urgency sectors are earmarked for gradual localisation, cluster-based development and long-horizon capability building.\n\nThe Survey also flags emerging growth engines such as the “orange economy” or concert economy, noting that live entertainment has crossed Rs 10,000 crore in size post-pandemic. To unlock its potential, the government is working on a single-window clearance mechanism for live events, addressing the current requirement of 10–15 separate approvals.\n\nOther reform signals include a renewed push for industrial clusters to build manufacturing ecosystems, a return to BOT-style PPP models to revive greenfield infrastructure investment, and a sharper focus on skill development. Proposals such as composite schools, affordable housing for working women under the Sakhi Niwas scheme, and a unified digital platform linking workers, skills and vacancies point to a more integrated approach to labour markets.",

Analysts have commented on what lies ahead for the precious metals, and what investors should do.\n\nGold futures with April expiry on MCX dropped around 9 percent to hit a low of Rs 1,67,406 per 10 grams. This comes a day after the contracts hit a fresh lifetime high of Rs 1,93,096 per 10 grams. This means that the gold futures fell 13 percent (Rs 25,690 per 10 grams) in just one day.\n\nSilver futures with March expiry meanwhile dropped nearly 17 percent to Rs 3,32,002 per kilogram.

Any signs of changes in Import duty structure could reflect directly into MCX prices. Overall volatility with a corrective bias is expected to persist for few more sessions before markets stabilize at lower levels,” Sharma added.\n\nAlso read:Gold, silver ETFs crash up to 24% as precious metals tumble further from record highs",

Careers are still settling, families are growing, loans are being taken, and life feels expensive in ways it never did in your 20s. But this is exactly why this decade matters so much. The financial habits you form now quietly decide how hard or easy your 60s will be.\n\nHere are 10 habits that make the biggest difference.\n\n1. You start saving before you feel “ready”\n\nMost people wait for the perfect moment to save seriously. Higher salary, fewer expenses, more stability. That moment rarely arrives. People who do well later are the ones who start saving even when it feels uncomfortable. Small, consistent investments in your 30s get decades to compound. Waiting for comfort is one of the costliest delays.\n\n2. You treat retirement as non-negotiable\n\nIn your 30s, it’s tempting to see retirement saving as optional. Something you’ll ramp up later. The people who retire comfortably usually decide early that retirement comes first, before lifestyle upgrades. They increase savings when income rises, instead of letting expenses absorb every raise.\n\n3. You don’t rely on “one big asset” to save you\n\nMany people in their 30s mentally outsource retirement to one thing. A house, a business, an inheritance, or a future windfall. That’s risky. Markets change, businesses fail, property cycles stall. A solid retirement plan is boring and diversified, not dependent on a single lucky outcome.\n\n4. You keep lifestyle inflation on a short leash\n\nIncome growth in your 30s is often real, and so is lifestyle creep. Bigger homes, better cars, more convenience spending. The habit that matters is not avoiding enjoyment, but slowing the pace at which expenses rise compared to income. Even a small gap between the two can become long-term wealth.\n\n5. You take enough risk, but not reckless risk\n\nYour 30s are when you can afford market volatility, but only if you understand it. Avoiding equity altogether is usually a mistake. Chasing hot themes blindly is another. The habit that pays off is sticking to a risk level you can live with through good and bad markets, without panic exits.\n\n6. You protect your downside early\n\nInsurance often feels like a grudge purchase. But locking in adequate health and term insurance in your 30s protects your future savings from being wiped out by one bad event. This is not about optimism or pessimism. It’s about not letting emergencies hijack long-term plans.\n\n7. You separate goals instead of mixing everything\n\nRetirement money should not constantly be raided for short-term needs. People who do well create mental and actual separation between money meant for retirement and money meant for goals like travel, education, or upgrades. This habit prevents silent erosion of long-term wealth.\n\n8. You review, even when nothing feels wrong\n\nA quiet but powerful habit is periodic review. Not because something is broken, but because life keeps changing. Goals move, risk tolerance evolves, and portfolios drift. People who course-correct early avoid painful corrections later.\n\n9. You avoid debt becoming permanent background noise\n\nNot all debt is bad, but permanent high EMIs crowd out long-term investing. In your 30s, the habit that matters is resisting the urge to stack multiple long-tenure obligations without a clear payoff. Retirement suffers when every surplus rupee is already spoken for.\n\n10. You think in decades, not just years\n\nThe biggest shift in your 30s is mental. You stop thinking only about the next few years and start thinking in 20- and 30-year blocks. This long view changes how you invest, spend, and react to short-term noise. It’s often the difference between financial stress and financial resilience later.\n\nRetirement outcomes are rarely decided by one brilliant investment or one perfect year. They’re shaped by habits repeated quietly over decades. Your 30s are when those habits harden. You don’t need perfection. You just need consistency, restraint, and the willingness to think longer than feels natural right now.",

        "full_content": "A lot of business owners sign up for a business credit card thinking it works like a corporate line of credit. It usually doesn’t. In India, business credit cards are closer to personal cards with a business label than to true company borrowing. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it’s important to know what you’re getting into.\n\nWhat a business credit card really means in India\n\nMost business credit cards in India are issued to individuals who run businesses, not to businesses as fully separate legal entities. Even if the card carries your firm’s name, the bank almost always asks for a personal guarantee. In simple terms, if the bill isn’t paid, the bank comes after you, not just the business.\n\nThis is especially true for sole proprietors, freelancers, and small private limited companies. Large corporates operate differently, but for most people, a business card is still tied closely to their personal credit profile.\n\nIn daily life, business credit cards are used for fairly routine things. Travel bookings, fuel, online ads, software subscriptions, client meals, and office purchases are common. They’re handy because they centralise spending and make it easier to track business expenses in one place.\n\nFunctionally, they work just like personal cards. You get a statement every month, a due date, and the option to pay in full or revolve the balance. Interest kicks in quickly if you don’t clear dues, and it’s expensive.\n\nBanks usually look at two things before setting a limit: your business cash flows and your personal credit history. Even if your business is doing reasonably well, a weak personal credit score can hold you back. This reflects how lending works in India, under rules overseen by the Reserve Bank of India, where individual responsibility still matters a lot for small businesses.\n\nIn practice, this means a business credit card doesn’t insulate your personal finances from your business. The two remain closely linked.\n\nAbout rewards and “benefits” Business cards often advertise rewards linked to travel, fuel, or business services. These can be useful, but they’re rarely game-changing. If you carry balances month to month, interest costs will wipe out any rewards very quickly. These cards work best when dues are paid in full.\n\nThe biggest issue is using business credit cards to plug ongoing cash shortfalls. Cards are meant for short-term timing gaps, not for funding losses or slow-paying clients. Another common mistake is mixing personal and business spending, which creates accounting headaches and tax confusion later.\n\nThere’s also a tendency to underestimate personal risk. Because the card says “business”, people assume liability is limited. In most cases, it isn’t.\n\nBusiness credit cards can be genuinely useful if you treat them as a convenience tool, not as funding. They help with tracking expenses and smoothing short-term cash flow. But in India, they are still very much tied to the individual behind the business. Used carefully and paid off on time, they can help. Used casually, they can quietly drag both business and personal finances down.",

        "full_content": "For equity investors, performance is increasingly determined not just by market movements but by how much is left after taxes and transaction charges. With both capital gains tax and securities transaction tax (STT) adding to the cost of investing, the margins have narrowed. As the Union Budget 2026 draws closer, investors are keen to see whether the government eases this layered burden or opts to maintain the status quo.\n\nSenthil R Kumar, MD & CEO of Nitstone Finserv, says any relief in STT would be a welcome step to make markets more accessible and strengthen investor confidence, supporting India’s growing equity culture.\n\nThe deepest impact seems to be from the doubling of STT, which was announced in the previous Budget. The rates on options selling were increased from 0.0625 percent to 0.1 percent of the option premium, while STT on futures trades went up from 0.0125 percent to 0.02 percent of the contract value.\n\nAt the same time, the tax burden on gains has also risen. Long-term capital gains tax was increased from 10 percent to 12.5 percent, while short-term capital gains moved up from 15 percent to 20 percent. According to brokerages and mutual fund distributors, this combination of higher taxes is dampening the appeal of market-linked investment products.\n\nInvestor unease is most evident around STT. When it was introduced in 2004, equity long-term capital gains were exempt, and STT was pitched as a modest, straightforward levy that could replace capital gains tax while improving transaction tracking. Nearly twenty years on, with capital gains taxes firmly back in place, the relevance and structure of STT are once again under scrutiny.\n\nRohit Jain, Managing Partner at Singhania & Co, notes that STT was introduced to replace LTCG tax. With LTCG now reinstated, the system effectively collects double taxes on the same income, and STT, levied on transaction value rather than profit, becomes a sunk cost that cannot be recovered even in losses.\n\nRetail-focused traders and brokers are hopeful that STT on delivery-based equity trades will be rationalised. They argue that lowering this cost would meaningfully reduce friction for long-term investors and could unlock broader participation in the securities market. Several market voices even feel STT should be removed entirely, given that trading costs are already high due to capital gains tax and brokerage expenses.\n\nSR Patnaik, Partner (Head–Taxation) at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, says traders expect the Budget 2026 to rationalise or reduce STT for delivery-based equity trades as it would substantially cut trading costs and boost market activity.\n\nB. Shravanth Shanker of B. Shanker Advocates LLP points out that STT directly erodes long-term post-tax returns and that a calibrated reduction could strengthen household participation without materially affecting revenue.\n\nAnkit Jain, Partner at Ved Jain and Associates, emphasises that while STT is a behavioural tool to discourage excessive speculation, the overlapping tax layers present a psychological barrier for new investors, even if they are less harmful to disciplined long-term portfolios.\n\nAbhishek Dev, Co-founder of Epsilon Money, says the street expects some ease in capital formation measures, especially on STT and related taxes, in the upcoming budget to improve medium- and long-term sentiment.\n\nFor small investors, the cumulative burden of STT, capital gains tax, brokerage, exchange charges, and GST significantly reduce effective returns, especially on modest portfolios. Unlike institutional players, retail investors lack the scale to absorb transaction costs efficiently. This layered cost structure discourages frequent participation and long - term compounding. Equity investors are demanding that Budget 2026 treat STT relief as part of a broader transaction cost rationalisation to improve market accessibility.",

        "full_content": "Silver exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in India have experienced substantial growth driven by high demand and industrial use. They are delivering strong, sometimes triple-digit, returns, attracting significant investor interest alongside gold. In a scenario like this, will the government take measures to regulate or cool investor inflows into silver ETFs, similar to past interventions in other overheated asset classes?\n\nWhile there have been no official announcements from the finance ministry regarding any curbs or measures to regulate, the recent froth in Silver ETFs makes regulatory scrutiny highly likely.\n\n\"Historical precedents suggest that if an asset class experiences parabolic growth – such as the recent annual returns of more than 270% seen in some Indian Silver ETFs – the finance minister may use taxation or SEBI-led directives to prevent systematic risk,\" said Sameer Mathur, MD and founder of Roinet Solution.\n\nIn September 2025 alone, silver ETFs attracted approximately Rs 36,500 crore, signalling a potential shift from “smart hedging” to retail FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). To avoid overheating, several major MFs temporarily halted fresh lump-sum investments in Silver Fund of Funds (FoFs) due to a high domestic premium.\n\nVarun Gupta, CEO - Groww Mutual Fund, said, \"We are seeing heightened inflows into silver ETFs, driven by recent price performance and silver’s increasing relevance in industrial applications such as renewable energy and EVs. As a result, silver ETF AUM in India crossed Rs 40,000 crore by October 25 and exceeded Rs 72,000 crore by the end of December 2025. However, commodities can be volatile, and flows linked purely to momentum may not always be durable.\"\n\nDomestic shortages led to silver trading at a premium in India compared to global prices. Geopolitical tensions have driven investors towards 'safe haven' commodities, but the rapid pace of the rally has raised concerns about a 'bubble' phase.\"\n\nMathur said, \"If the finance minister decides to act, the measure could include revised capital gains rules to discourage short-term speculative trading, enhanced disclosure requiring fund houses to provide clearer warnings about tracking error, and formalising the 'lump-sum' bans that may be imposed by a few fund houses.\n\nAny investor in silver ETFs / silver trading should be prepared for sharp corrections, as recent history shows that after massive rallies, regulators often step in, which can lead to a cooling-off period in prices.\n\nETFs fell in trading today as precious metals prices plunged following a record rally. The MCX silver price fell by Rs 80,000 from the record high. Analysts already projected that such an event might occur if growth were to be parabolic.\n\nMathur said, \"For investors, it is always better to diversify, avoiding concentrations of more than 5-10% in any single commodity, such as silver, given its high volatility.\"\n\n\"The regulatory framework for commodity ETFs in India is already fairly robust, and historically, policy actions — when taken — have focused on ensuring orderly market functioning and investor protection rather than restricting investor choice. Investors should be mindful of volatility and use silver as a measured allocation within a diversified portfolio,\" added Gupta.",

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey: 2025-26 was released at the back of unpredictable global economic order.  With major countries becoming increasingly inward looking and breaking the global value chains, countries like India trying to navigate through this changing global order and becoming, as per Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran’s words, increasingly ‘strategically indispensable’.\n\nIn this context, apart from making macro assessments for FY27, the Survey brings out many micro and process related reforms to overcome the global shocks that we have witnessed since beginning of 2025.\n\nGrowth will be sustained only through reforms\n\nTwo chapters that highlight the medium to long-term strategy in the Survey are one on industry and infrastructure investments.  The Survey argues that for reviving domestic drivers of growth there is a need to focus on structural transformation, productivity and competitiveness. While Indian industry has witnessed greater momentum with the growth rate of 6.2 per cent in 2025-26, with strong acceleration in manufacturing at 7 per cent., sustaining such high growth needs sustained reforms in many areas.\n\nThe Survey positions the industry sector as the one ready for its next big leap, with the backing of the continued thrust placed on infrastructure and logistics by the government.  In addition to this the support through Production Linked Incentives (PLI) schemes and other interventions such as the India Semiconductor Mission, combined by the focused approach towards strengthening the MSMEs changing the face of Indian industry.  All these measures are expected to reduce the cost of production.\n\nHowever, the Survey could have looked at this aspect little more in-depth whether these reforms have led to reduction in cost of production.\n\nA tech orientation to the diversification of industrial base\n\nThe Survey also highlights the developments in the Research & Development where government has taken a number of initiatives leading to a shift towards high technology manufacturing, as medium and high technology activities accounted for over 46 per cent of India’s total manufacturing value added. The Survey highlights that the most significant change in the recent period is the diversification of the industrial base to include tech-intensive segments.\n\nThe Survey argues that India needs to strengthen its backward linkages in the global value chains that will also improve export growth. As we navigate this path, strengthening export competitiveness along with reducing the excessive reliance on imports becomes crucial. In the changing global environment, the Survey argues, strategically placing oneself in the global value chain requires Swadeshi path.  The Survey deals the Swadeshi issue little more in-depth and argues that it is inevitable for India to adopt Swadeshi for four reasons: global order has changed, trade is no longer fair, markets no longer neutral, and supply chains have become state instruments.  Further, it provides a number of examples of how so many countries already adopting swadeshi.\n\nEmployment-intensity of industrialization needed more focus\n\nLast Union Budget, while assessing the PLI scheme, it has shifted its focus to Employment Linked Incentive (ELI) scheme as any growth in industry should also need to be employment generating.  However, the Survey, although there is a separate chapter on employment, doesn’t delve enough on this aspect in the context of industrialisation.   This is especially so as the transition that the industry undergoing it needs to generate more employment.  One of the special themes of the Survey is Artificial Intelligence (AI).  However, the Survey could have engaged analytically on the impact of AI on employment.\n\nOn the infrastructure, the Survey extensively discusses the consistent push given by the Union government towards infrastructure, which has significantly strengthened connectivity. However, one must study more on its broad spillovers to completely understand its outcome. Investments in infrastructure which has been a continued priority of the Union government has harnessed its benefits through better connectivity among the urban centres, through shorter travel time, particularly helping quicker freight movements along with the last mile connectivity taking on board the rural centres. The Survey suggest that with improvement in ease of doing business, there has been a better participation from the private sector under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) models. However, the Survey could have highlighted that success of PPP model is limited only to few and not across all the infrastructure sectors.\n\nDomestic savings needs attention\n\nThe Survey, while arguing that the India’s potential GDP growth has improved from 6.5 to 7 per cent, suggest that key reforms that encompass industry and infrastructure have played a major role in enhancing potential growth.  And this could be through larger multiplier effect expected from public investments.  Here it highlights three aspects for this improvement: improvement in capital accumulation; labor market reforms; and improvement in productivity.\n\nWith an investment rate of 30 per cent, potential growth of 7 per cent requires substantial productivity improvement.  The Survey argues that with digital public infrastructure and with increased focus on regulatory simplifications as well as with efficiency gains, the productivity is expected to improve.\n\nIn the case of capital accumulation, as it is largely dependent on domestic savings and is declining over the years, there is need to focus on measures to revive the domestic savings.  Many studies have suggested that India need to enhance its investment rate atleast by 2 to 3 per cent to achieve 7 to 8 per cent growth for Viksit Bharat.  This needs more domestic savings. Else, this would also have implications on the external account as well as rupee value.  Bearing this limitation on the external account, in all, the Survey presents an optimistic picture about the Indian economy and backs with very convincing arguments as well as policy initiatives.\n\n(Blessy Augustine is anAssistant Professor and N R Bhanumurthy is Director of the Madras School of Economics.)\n\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "The rupee has slipped to fresh lows in recent months, extending a phase of underperformance despite India posting one of its strongest macroeconomic runs in decades.\n\nCurrency pressures have intensified amid volatile global capital flows, heightened geopolitical risks, and a sharp reassessment of risk by global investors, even as growth remains robust and inflation largely contained.\n\nIn calendar 2025 and this January, the rupee weakened as foreign portfolio flows turned intermittent and India’s balance of payments came under strain. Persistent merchandise trade deficits, coupled with periods of capital outflows, have weighed on the currency, pushing it to levels that many economists say do not reflect India’s underlying economic strength.\n\nAccording toBloombergdata, the domestic currency is down by 2.22 percent, so far in January . So far in the current financial year, the local currency is down by 7.02 percent. On January 30, it was trading at 91.9512 against the US dollar.\n\n“The INR depreciation reflects capital outflows with BoP (balance of payment) turning significantly negative in Q2-Q3FY26. The RBI's ability to defend the currency is limited by a large forward book. The latter limits its ability to sterilise intervention,” said Gaura Sengupta, Economist at IDFC First Bank.\n\nThe Economic Survey 2025-26 acknowledges this divergence bluntly, noting that “the Indian rupee underperformed in 2025”, even as growth momentum stayed strong .\n\nThe survey explains that India’s dependence on foreign capital to finance its external gap leaves the currency vulnerable when global risk appetite fades. “India runs a trade deficit in goods… When (foreign capital flows) run drier, rupee stability becomes a casualty.”\n\nWhat makes the recent depreciation striking, the survey argues, is that it comes at a time when most domestic macro indicators are supportive. “Growth is good; the outlook remains favourable; inflation is contained… banks are healthy; liquidity conditions are comfortable,” it says, adding that “the rupee’s valuation does not accurately reflect India’s stellar economic fundamentals”\n\nIn a notable phrase, the survey characterises the currency as being undervalued, stating that “the rupee, therefore, is punching below its weight.” It concedes that a weaker rupee offers some near-term insulation, helping exporters and offsetting the impact of higher US tariffs, while noting there is currently “no threat of higher inflation from higher-priced crude oil imports.”\n\nHowever, the survey also flags the downside. Persistent weakness in the currency, it warns, can dampen investor confidence. “It does cause investors to pause. Investor reluctance to commit to India warrants examination,” it says\n\nThe survey strikes a cautious note on currency stability. In an increasingly fragmented global order marked by geopolitical tensions and financial volatility, it warns that disruptions to capital flows could become a recurring risk. “In all three scenarios, India is relatively better off than most other countries… but this does not guarantee insulation,” it notes, adding that capital-flow shocks could have a “consequent impact on the rupee.”",

The BSE midcap and the small cap indices outperformed the larger peers. BSE Metals (commodity rally), capital goods (budget expectation) and Oil & Gas (rise in oil price) were the major gainers in this week, whereas BSE Auto index (reacted to India EU FTA) witnessed correction.\n\nThe INR (vs USD) that has been weakening in recent weeks, hit fresh record lows this week. Oil prices have been climbing sharply in this week — with Brent crude and WTI hitting multi-month highs on rising geopolitical risk.

The index found strong intraday support twice in the 25220–25210 zone and staged a smart recovery towards the last hour. However, it closed the day at 25,321, down 0.39% for the day. After bouncing off its 200-day EMA in the previous session, Nifty failed to see meaningful follow-through and ended the day trading inside the prior day’s range.\n\nGoing ahead, the immediate resistance for Nifty is placed in the 25,450–25,500 zone, with the Index failing to decisively close above this zone after attempting twice in the last six sessions. A decisive breakout above this zone could result in Nifty extending its pullback towards 25,650, followed by 25,800 in the near term. On the downside, the 200-day EMA zone of 25,200–25,150 zone is likely to act as a strong support.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "Samuel Beckett’s absurdist play 'Waiting for Godot' shows the futility of waiting for the future with hope. While nihilistic, it would strike a chord with many Indians who have had a brush with the justice system. In fact, several of our institutions are guilty of taking too long to dispense with resolutions in the name of accuracy and thoroughness in procedure.\n\nLook how our prized reform Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is faringhere. The time taken for a resolution to just get your money back from a defunct company is not less than two years. Criminal justice court cases take a decade to reach a verdict and even consumer courts give out rulings quickly in rare cases. For any individual or a firm mired in procedure, resolution and restitution demand an exorbitant sunk cost.\n\nWhile institutions and systems are turtle-slow, capital is impatient. That is the reason the predictions of a surge of foreign investors in India’s junk assets market didn’t live up to the hype -- private credit is still dominated by already existing foreign investors and domestic players. The impatience of capital can be seen even in the microfinance sector where private equity thrusts business targets, sometimes lofty, onto microfinance lenders in the name of outreach to exit at a juicy valuation that such a growth brings.\n\nYet another set of impatient investors is in the bond markets. Imagine being given a free ticket to a party guaranteed to be fun filled and refusing it. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has thrown in rate cuts, large liquidity infusions, and outright purchases of bonds at the market, but nothing has stuck. Bond yields are still elevated because no matter how much the central bank buys, there is always more coming down thestate government pipe. For investors, the sovereign must offer more if it wants their money.\n\nIn a Trumpian world, we have been witnesses to impatience of unprecedented scale. Foreign investors want nothing to do with Indian equities even when it is dressed in perhaps the best macroeconomic performance in many years. Dollars are flying off everyday to find newer lucrative shores as America under President Trump recasts global trade.\n\nIf Indian policymakers had walked the path that says success comes to those who wait, Indian markets would have been far worse off today. For once the RBI cannot be accused of doing too little too late on liquidity or interest rates. The central government too has done its bit throughout this fiscal year, from income tax reductions to goods and services tax revamp that fuelled consumption.\n\nInvestors are hoping that the Union Budget on Sunday will continue to show that it has got their backs. Ananya Royin her column here, lists what are these expectations that are priced in the markets today. Indeed, stock market investors are willing to work on a Sunday rather than wait 24 hours to place their bets on the Budget announcements. There is no regard for delayed gratification here because capital is impatient, always.\n\nThat brings us to a rather cheeky section of the Economic Survey titled 'Delayed gratification and the cost of impatience'. The survey censures Indian citizens on their impatience with state machinery and policy in developmental work. Manas Chakravarty lays bare the Survey’s delusional lament about this impatiencein his column hereand argues that Indians are impatient because institutions do not deliver on time. “When contract enforcement takes a decade, delayed gratification becomes economically irrational,” he points out. The Survey errors in painting institutional failure as a cultural failing.\n\nWe started with saying that it takes more than two years of time for creditors to get money back from a defaulting company and why capital won’t stay that long. When capital is impatient, why shouldn’t people be? To be fair, patient capital earns more and there are the likes of gurus such as Warren Buffett who support patient investing, also called value investing. But when patience becomes an exercise akin to waiting for Godot who never arrives, the whole approach is futile.\n\nInvesting insights from our research team\n\nIDBI Bank disinvestment – How much could a potential bidder pay for the bank?\n\nWeekly Tactical Pick: Why you should look at this infrastructure bellwether\n\nSwiggy Q3 FY26: Strong growth, profitability still a challenge\n\nMas Financial Q3 FY26: the earnings quality is noteworthy\n\nTata Motors: Growth momentum gains speed\n\nDabur Q3FY26: Consumption tailwinds to steer growth trajectory\n\nITC Q3FY26: Business mix to aid profitability amid tax headwinds\n\nDixon Technologies Q3 FY26: Industry headwinds drive near-term softness\n\nAcutaas Chemicals: Next fiscal to see traction in new businesses\n\nBudget Snapshot: How states are messing up the sovereign’s debt market standing\n\nThe Economic Survey's delayed gratification delusion\n\nWhat's priced in, and what could move markets, post Budget 2026?\n\nHow the Budget can help India capitalise on Trump’s tariff self-goal\n\nWaaree’s bet on clean energy value chain is necessary, but not without risks\n\nPersonal Finance: Why you must think about retirement planning\n\nEmerging markets make roaring start to 2026 as dollar slides(republished from the FT)\n\nWhat to Expect from India’s Budget 2026: Insights from the Economic Survey\n\nEconomic Survey shines the light on growth in times of external uncertainty\n\nEconomic Survey emphasises building strategic influence\n\nIndia’s next competitiveness test is input costs, not incentives\n\nEconomic Survey highlights a new vision for tech sovereignty in India\n\nTechnical Picks:GAIL,NOCIL, GRSE, GOLDBEES",

        "full_content": "For most people, retirement anxiety isn’t about returns. It’s about certainty. Will there be a steady monthly income when the salary stops? Will basic expenses still be covered, no matter what markets do?\n\nThat’s where annuity plans come in. They aren’t exciting, and they aren’t meant to be. Their job is simple: to convert a lump sum into predictable income for life or for a fixed period.\n\nSo what exactly is an annuity?\n\nAn annuity is a financial product, usually bought from an insurance company, where you pay a lump sum upfront and receive regular income in return. This income can start immediately or after a few years, depending on the plan you choose.\n\nThink of it as creating your own pension. You hand over capital, and in exchange, you get monthly, quarterly, or annual payouts that you can rely on.\n\nAnnuities appeal to people who value stability over flexibility. If market-linked investments rise and fall, annuities stay boringly steady.\n\nThey are often used to cover non-negotiable expenses in retirement: groceries, utilities, basic healthcare, rent or maintenance. Once those are taken care of, other investments can be allowed to fluctuate without causing panic.\n\nIn short, annuities buy peace of mind, not high returns.\n\nThe main types of annuity plans\n\nImmediate annuities start paying income almost right away, usually within a month or a year of investment. These are popular with retirees who already have a lump sum from provident fund, gratuity, or NPS and want income immediately.\n\nDeferred annuities start payouts later. You invest today, let the amount grow for a few years, and then begin receiving income at a chosen age. These work better for people who are still a few years away from retirement.\n\nLife annuities pay income for as long as you live. Some stop when you pass away, while others continue to a spouse. The longer the guarantee, the lower the monthly payout tends to be.\n\nAnnuities with return of purchase price give your nominee the original amount back after your death. This provides comfort to families but usually reduces the income slightly.\n\nHow to choose the right annuity for you\n\nThe first question to ask isn’t about rates. It’s about purpose.\n\nHow much guaranteed income do you need every month to feel secure? Not your lifestyle spends, just the essentials.\n\nOnce that number is clear, look at annuities as a way to fill that gap. Many retirees don’t put all their savings into annuities. They use them to cover basics and keep the rest invested for growth and flexibility.\n\nAlso consider whether you need income only for yourself or for a spouse as well. Joint-life annuities matter a lot in households where one partner may outlive the other by many years.\n\nAnnuities are mostly irreversible. Once you buy one, you can’t usually exit without losing value. That’s why timing matters.\n\nReturns are fixed at the time of purchase. If interest rates rise later, your annuity doesn’t change. This is why many people stagger annuity purchases instead of investing everything at once.\n\nTaxation also matters. Annuity income is taxed as regular income. This should be factored into how much you actually need to receive post-tax.\n\nThe role annuities should play\n\nAnnuities are not meant to replace all retirement planning. They are meant to remove fear from it.\n\nUsed wisely, they create a stable base so that you’re not forced to sell investments during bad market years or worry about monthly cash flow in your 70s or 80s.\n\nThey won’t make you rich. But they can make retirement feel predictable, and for many people, that’s worth far more.\n\nThe right annuity isn’t the one with the highest payout. It’s the one that lets you sleep better, knowing that some income will keep coming no matter what.",

        "full_content": "Defence shares advanced on Friday, with the sectoral index logging its biggest weekly gain since May 2025, amid expectations of higher capital outlay in the upcoming Union Budget on February 1.\n\nThe Nifty India Defence Index rose over 1.5 percent to an intraday high of 8,193.50. The index is up 8.9 percent so far this week, marking its strongest weekly rise since May 2025, when India-Pakistan border tensions had flared.\n\nThe rally comes ahead of the Union Budget, with analysts expecting a substantial increase in defence capital spending.\n\nOm Ghawalkar, Market Analyst, Share.Market (PhonePe Wealth), noted \"the Nifty India Defence Index is flashing strong bullish signals as it prepares for a major breakout from a Double Bottom pattern. Currently trading at 8,184, the index has gained 8% this week, significantly outperforming the broader market. This momentum is supported by a Golden Crossover, where the 10-day and 21-day moving averages have climbed above the medium-term trend, confirming a new uptrend. With a rising MACD and prices holding well above all key moving averages, the technical setup suggests that buyers are firmly in control.\"\n\n\"The index's strength is further highlighted by its position relative to long-term trend lines. It is currently trading comfortably above its 50-day SMA and its 200-day SMA, which indicates a robust primary trend. The recent \"Golden Crossover\" specifically saw the short-term averages move past the 100-day SMA, providing a clear technical \"buy\" signal for momentum traders looking at the medium-term horizon. Looking ahead, the index faces immediate hurdles at 8,350 and 8,450. A clean break above these resistance levels could trigger a fresh rally toward previous record highs. On the downside, the 7,300–7,400 zone provides a solid support floor, protecting against sudden volatility. As the Union Budget 2026 approaches on February 1, this pre-budget momentum highlights the sector's strength and its role as a key growth theme for investors in the current market.\n\nHemant Sood, Managing Director, Findoc, said \"The sharp rally in defence stocks reflects strong investor expectations of a higher defence allocation in the upcoming Union Budget, driven largely by evolving global geopolitical tensions and rising security concerns. With ongoing international conflicts, markets are factoring in increased focus on defence preparedness and modernization.\"\n\n\"Within the sector, aerial combat technologies and drone manufacturing are likely to remain key beneficiaries, as next-generation warfare increasingly relies on surveillance, automation, and advanced combat systems. Additionally, defence PSU stocks are expected to stay in focus, given their direct linkage to government spending and execution. From a valuation standpoint, defence stocks are not excessively stretched, which further supports the ongoing momentum. Overall, a favourable budgetary push, combined with strategic importance and reasonable valuations, is driving sustained investor interest in the defence space,\" he added.\n\nAccording to Emkay Research, recent geopolitical developments leave the government with limited flexibility, necessitating higher defence outlays. The brokerage has forecast a 12–13 percent year-on-year growth in defence spending over the next three to four years. Nuvama Institutional Equities also expects the Budget to accelerate spending in the sector.\n\nMacquarie said India could raise defence expenditure to 2.5 percent of GDP by fiscal 2027 from 1.9 percent in the current fiscal, with a sharper focus on indigenisation. The defence index has gained 5.15 percent so far in January, compared with a 3.3 percent decline in the benchmark Nifty 50.\n\nThe Nifty India Defence Index had fallen 1.2 percent in the previous session but recovered those losses on Friday. All its 18 constituents were trading in the green.\n\nDynamatic Technologiesemerged as the top gainer, rising 8 percent to Rs 8,790 per share.Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineersand MTAR Technologies followed, advancing 7.37 percent and 7.19 percent, respectively.\n\nMTAR Technologies reported a strong performance in the December quarter, supported by healthy execution across segments and operating leverage. The company’s net profit more than doubled to Rs 34.6 crore in the third quarter of FY26 from Rs 15.9 crore a year ago, while revenue rose 56.9 percent year-on-year to Rs 273.7 crore. EBITDA jumped 80.7 percent to Rs 59.8 crore, with operating margin improving to 22 percent from 19 percent in the corresponding quarter last year.\n\n\"GRSE is mirroring the Nifty Defence Index’s bullish structure, currently trading at ₹2,764. Technically, the stock is primed for an uptrend as it forms a Double Bottom pattern with strong volume accumulation. While ₹2,100 serves as a solid support floor, the stock faces its next major test at the ₹3,000 psychological resistance level. MTAR Technologies is witnessing a powerful technical breakout, surging past the critical Rs 2,700 resistance to reach Rs 2,931. This move is validated by a massive volume spike and a bullish MACD crossover, signaling that the stock has shifted from consolidation to an aggressive growth phase. Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders is showing early signs of a bullish reversal as it successfully closed above its 50-day moving average this week,\" added Ghawalkar.\n\nShares of Paras Defence and Space Technologies, Cochin Shipyard, Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, Bharat Electronics and Hindustan Aeronautics also gained up to 3 percent.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "Shriram Finance is targeting 15 percent AUM growth in FY26, with potential upside to 16-17 percent, as improving economic momentum, GST reforms and resilient rural demand continue to support credit expansion, Umesh Revankar, Executive Vice Chairman said.\n\nSpeaking to Moneycontrol after the company’s Q3 FY26 earnings, Revankar said the lender is “working towards” the higher growth range, reflecting confidence in the operating environment while maintaining a cautious and calibrated outlook.\n\nHe linked the company’s performance directly to India’s GDP growth, noting that economic expansion has had a positive impact across both urban and rural markets, with rural demand emerging as the stronger driver. This macroeconomic tailwind has translated into steady operating performance for the lender.\n\nFinancially, the momentum was reflected in the numbers. Revenue grew 14.6 percent, while adjusted net profit rose 51 percent, after normalising for the one-time impact of the housing finance company sale in the same quarter last year. The company also reported improved margins, lower interest costs and stronger asset quality, with credit costs and Stage 3 assets (both gross and net) showing improvement.\n\nThe business mix continues to be supported by structurally strong mobility demand. Passenger vehicles (PV) have grown materially faster than the overallloanbook, driven by two distinct demand patterns, which is private mobility demand rising in rural markets, and public mobility demand concentrated in urban centres, supported by higher demand for cabs, buses and transport services amid limited state government spending on public transport infrastructure.\n\nCommercial vehicles (CVs), which account for around 46 percent of AUM, remain Sriram Finance’s core franchise. While passenger vehicle financing will continue to scale, the company intends to accelerate CV growth beyond 15 percent, compared to the current 12–14 percent range.\n\nOn the strategic front, the entry of MUFG as a 20 percent shareholder marks a long-term shift in capital strategy. Instead of incremental fundraising through QIPs or rights issues, the company opted for a global strategic partner to support growth, strengthen risk and technology capabilities, and build long-term competitiveness, particularly against banks.\n\nRevankar said the capital raised will be primarily deployed for business expansion and customer retention, as Sriram Finance looks to consolidate its position in India’s structurally expanding credit market.\n\nAt an organisational level, the group is also moving towards structural simplification, with lending businesses consolidated under Sriram Finance and non-lending businesses, such as insurance, structured separately.",

This came amid a sharp drop in silver prices in the second session.\n\nSilver prices on COMEX dropped around 14 percent to $98.685 per ounce. This comes a day after the precious metal hit a fresh lifetime high of $119.51 per ounce.\n\nSilver futures with March expiry meanwhile dropped 15 percent to Rs 3,39,910 per kilogram. The contracts with May and July expiries also fell 15 percent and 12 percent respectively.\n\nThe sharp fall in global prices of the precious metals comes amid speculations that the US Federal Reserve may get a more hawkish chair. US President Donald Trump said he intends to announce his pick to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday, as speculation intensifies over who will lead the American central bank after Jerome Powell steps aside in May.\n\n\"So, a potentially less dovish Fed Chairman pick, a rebound in the dollar and gold giving way to overbought conditions have contributed to the decline in the price of the precious metal,\" Reuters quoted KCM Chief Trade Analyst Tim Waterer as saying.\n\n\"Rumours that Kevin Warsh will replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair has weighed on gold during Asian trade,\" said Matt Simpson, a senior analyst at StoneX, as quoted by the report.\n\nSilver ETFs mirrored that sharp declinein the industrial metal. Axis Silver ETF crashed 24 percent, while ICICI Prudential Silver and Kotak Silver ETF fell nearly 23 percent. SBI Silver ETF and others fell more than 22 percent each.\n\nMirae Asset Silver ETF, Motilal Oswal Silver ETF, HDFC Silver ETF and Nippon India Silver ETF also plunged sharply.\n\nHindustan Zinc is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity. Hence, the fall in the precious metals pushed the stock down.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "Thematic and sectoral funds often arrive wrapped in a compelling narrative. Defence spending is rising. Manufacturing is shifting to India. Electric vehicles are the future. Banking will always grow with the economy. Compared to broad, diversified funds, these products feel sharper and more intentional, as though you are aligning your money with the future rather than the past.\n\nThat appeal is real. So is the risk.\n\nWhat these funds actually invest in\n\nSectoral funds restrict themselves to a single sector such as IT, pharma, financials, energy, or metals. Thematic funds cast a slightly wider net, but they are still built around one idea. A theme like infrastructure, digitalisation, or manufacturing may cut across sectors, but it is still a concentrated bet.\n\nThe key point is this: neither type has the freedom to move away when conditions change. A diversified equity fund can reduce exposure to a struggling sector and increase exposure to a stronger one. A sectoral or thematic fund cannot. Its mandate locks it in.\n\nWhy returns can look spectacular at the right time\n\nWhen a sector or theme is in favour, these funds often outperform sharply. Earnings momentum, policy support, and positive news flow combine to push stock prices up together. Because the portfolio is concentrated, those gains show up clearly in fund performance.\n\nThis is usually when interest peaks. New funds are launched. Existing funds see inflows. Past returns are highlighted. For many investors, this creates a sense that they are “late but not too late.”\n\nIn reality, this is often the most dangerous entry point.\n\nSectors and themes are cyclical. They move in long waves shaped by policy, global demand, interest rates, regulation, and technology. What looks like a permanent shift can slow down or reverse.\n\nWhen that happens, these funds don’t gradually underperform. They can stagnate for years. Returns flatten. Relative performance looks disappointing. Investors lose patience and exit, often near the bottom of the cycle.\n\nThis boom-bust pattern is common across themes, from infrastructure to commodities to technology.\n\nTiming matters more than discipline\n\nWith diversified equity funds, long holding periods smooth out a lot of mistakes. Time compensates for imperfect timing. With sectoral and thematic funds, time alone is not enough. Entry and exit matter far more.\n\nMost retail investors are not good at this. They tend to buy after strong performance and sell after disappointment. In a concentrated fund, that behaviour gap can destroy returns even if the long-term theme eventually plays out.\n\nWhere these funds can fit sensibly\n\nThematic and sectoral funds work best as satellite holdings, not as the core of a portfolio. They make sense when you already have broad equity exposure and want to express a specific, measured view with a small portion of your money.\n\nThey also suit investors who can tolerate long periods of underperformance without reacting. If a fund doing poorly for three or four years would make you uncomfortable, this category will test your patience.\n\nWhat to check before investing\n\nIt’s worth examining how tightly the fund sticks to its mandate, how diversified it is within the theme, and how it has behaved across market cycles. Just as important is clarity on why you’re investing. Is it because the story sounds convincing, or because it plays a defined role in your portfolio?\n\nThese funds demand more self-awareness than most people expect.\n\nA more useful way to frame the decision\n\nInstead of asking whether a theme is “the future,” ask how much of your portfolio you are willing to tie to that future being right, and being right within a certain time frame.\n\nIf the answer is “most of it,” the risk is probably too high.\n\nThematic and sectoral funds are neither heroes nor villains. They are precision tools. Used sparingly, they can add returns and express conviction. Used casually or emotionally, they often disappoint.\n\nThe real danger isn’t that these funds exist. It’s forgetting that a good story is not the same thing as a resilient investment strategy.",

        "full_content": "Active investing can feel exhausting. You worry about constant fund switches, performance comparisons, timing decisions, and about whether you picked the “right” manager. Passive investing appeals precisely because it steps away from all that.\n\nAt its core, passive investing is about accepting a simple idea: most investors don’t need to outsmart the market to meet their goals. They just need steady exposure to it, at low cost, over long periods.\n\nWhat passive investing really means\n\nPassive investing doesn’t mean doing nothing. It means choosing investments that track a market index instead of trying to outperform it. Index funds and exchange-traded funds are the most common tools here. They mirror an index, hold the same stocks in roughly the same proportion, and don’t rely on a fund manager’s calls.\n\nBecause there’s less buying and selling and no star manager involved, costs stay low. Over time, those lower costs can make a surprisingly big difference to returns.\n\nMarkets, especially broad ones, already reflect the combined knowledge and expectations of millions of participants. Trying to consistently beat that is harder than it sounds. Data across markets shows that many actively managed funds struggle to outperform their benchmarks over long periods, especially after fees.\n\nPassive investing sidesteps this problem. You don’t need to predict which stocks or sectors will shine next year. You simply participate in the market’s overall growth.\n\nThis approach works particularly well for long-term goals like retirement, children’s education, or wealth accumulation over decades.\n\nHow to start building a passive portfolio\n\nThe easiest way to begin is with a broad market index fund. This gives you instant diversification across large companies, without needing to analyse individual stocks.\n\nOnce that base is in place, you can add a second layer over time. Some investors include a mid-cap or total market index fund for broader exposure. Others add a bond or debt index fund to reduce volatility as their goals get closer.\n\nYou don’t need many funds. In fact, one of the strengths of passive investing is how simple it stays. Two or three well-chosen index funds are often enough for most portfolios.\n\nA common misconception is that you need to “enter at the right time”. With passive investing, discipline matters far more than timing.\n\nUsing systematic investment plans helps smooth out market ups and downs. You invest regularly, regardless of headlines, and let time do the heavy lifting. This also removes emotion from the process, which is where many investors stumble.\n\nWhat passive investing won’t do\n\nPassive investing won’t give you bragging rights at dinner parties. There will always be someone who picked a stock that doubled faster. And in certain years, actively managed funds may outperform.\n\nThe trade-off is consistency and peace of mind. Passive investing is designed to help you reach your goals reliably, not chase the best possible outcome in any single year.\n\nIt also requires patience. The real benefits show up over long stretches, not months.\n\nKeep costs, taxes and behaviour in check\n\nCosts are one of the few things investors can control. Even a small difference in expense ratios compounds over time. Similarly, frequent buying and selling can create tax inefficiencies that quietly eat into returns.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, passive investing works best when you leave it alone. Resist the urge to tinker every time markets fall or surge. Review your portfolio periodically, rebalance if needed, and then step back.\n\nPassive investing is not about lowering ambition. It’s about choosing a strategy that matches how real markets behave and how real people live.\n\nIf you’re looking for a calm, low-maintenance way to build wealth, starting with a simple passive portfolio may be one of the smartest financial decisions you make.",

This marks a 48 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall from the Rs 1,355 crore net profit reported in the same period last year.\n\nThe earnings however were impacted by some exceptional losses. The firm incurred a one-time cost of Rs 962 crore to account for the stamp duty charges payable to various local authorities to effect transfer of registration of land acquired as part of the its demerger scheme.\n\nAdditionally, the company also incurred a one-time cost of Rs 603 crore due to the implementation of the new labour codes, which took effect last year, along with Rs 82 crore for acquisition.\n\nOverall, the company incurred exceptional costs worth Rs 1,643 crore during the quarter.\n\nThe CV-maker’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose more than 16 percent YoY to Rs 21,847 crore during the quarter under review. Operating margin improved to 12.60 percent in Q3 FY26 from 12.07 percent in Q3 FY25, while profit margin reduced to 3.23 percent.\n\nTata Motors reported a 30 bps increase in consolidated EBITDA to 12.5 percent during the October-December quarter of the ongoing FY26.\n\nMotilal Oswal said that the firm’s Q3 results missed estimates, led by input cost pressures. The automaker’s Q3 profit was below the domestic brokerage’s expectations due to lower-than-expected margin at 12.8 percent.\n\n“The key concern for TMCV has been its gradual loss of market share across key segments. Further, its recent acquisition of Iveco would expose it to the ongoing global macro uncertainties, thereby driving a potential de-rating, if demand does not improve anytime soon. We have already factored in a pickup in domestic CV demand in our estimates (we estimate 9% volume CAGR over FY25-28E). We also factor in margins to remain stable at 13% over FY25-28E,” Motilal said.\n\nHowever, the brokerage added that the stock appears to be fairly valued now after a recent rally. It remained ‘Neutral’ on the stock, with a target price of Rs 431 apiece, which implies an upside potential of more than 8 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.\n\nEmkay Global said that the firm’s net profit beat its estimate mainly on account of lower-than-expected tax expense. “We believe the overall CV demand environment remains constructive, with double-digit growth likely to sustain till H1FY27 – TMCV should lead this multi-year upcycle in our view,” it said.\n\nThe firm retained its ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 650 apiece, which implies an upside potential of more than 38 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.\n\nJM Financial said that rising commodity prices are expected to have impact on margins in Q4 FY26. “To partly offset this, the company has implemented a 1% price hike effective 1st Jan’26, while a potential moderation in discount intensity could provide additional support to the margins,” it said.\n\nThe brokerage kept a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 550 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 17 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "State-run Indian Oil Corporation will continue to purchase crude based on what makes commercial sense rather than discounts or geopolitical considerations, its chairman and managing director, Arvinder Singh Sahney, told Moneycontrol in an interview. The comments come as the country’s largest refiner lays out a strategy to diversify its sourcing base amid a volatile global oil market. The company has further identified land parcels for its nuclear energy projects and is in discussions with various states for the same. For its nuclear foray, the company is on the lookout for global partners to collaborate in the segment.\n\n1) How does the company plan to navigate the current geopolitical situation with US sanctions on Russian oil and a potential stabilisation of Venezuela’s oil sector? Do you plan to increase your sourcing of Venezuelan crude grades?\n\nWe procure crude purely on commercial considerations. Whichever grade is commercially beneficial for us, we will go for it. Expanding our crude basket has been a consistent priority: five years ago, we were sourcing from around 27 geographies; today, we source from 41. That effort will continue.\n\nAnyone is welcome if crude is available. Several refineries, across both the private sector and PSUs, are capable of processing a wide range of crude types.\n\n2) There’s a rebalancing underway in oil and gas, and data shows Russian imports have been declining for some refiners. Given the volatility, does IOC also plan to cut Russia sourcing and shift to more stable origins?\n\nWe rely on economic models to make those calls. If a crude stream works commercially for us, we take it; if it doesn’t, we don’t. It’s not just about a headline discount. The crude has to run through our refineries, and each grade comes with its own processing cost and yields a different product slate with different realisations.\n\nSo the optimisation is end-to-end, crude price, refining costs, product yields, and net margins. We run this through complex, AI-driven modelling, and we follow what the model output tells us is optimal now.\n\nThe environment is changing quickly. Crude prices have moved up again. Not long ago, we were looking at around $58 a barrel. In a market like this, decisions have to be dynamic, prudent, and commercially sound.\n\nWe will buy crude that makes commercial sense. Discounts matter, but they are only one factor, not the only one.\n\nKpler data point (context): IOC’s Russian crude imports in the first 23 days of 2026 were about 468 kbd, nearly matching the 470 kbd it averaged over all of 2023, indicating a sharp pickup at the start of this year.\n\n3) The three OMCs have concluded a one-year deal for imports of LPG from the US in 2026. When do you see the supply starting and are there any other regions you are looking to source LNG or LPG from?\n\nLPG is primarily available in these two regions only, either in the US or in the Gulf. We have taken up a conscious decision to diversify to a certain extent. The US LPG supply will start from April. We will always be on the lookout for good deals.\n\n4) Does the company plan to enter the nuclear segment?\n\nWe are evaluating it. As you know, we are one of only two companies in the country with a long-standing joint venture with NPCIL. NTPC has already moved ahead with some projects, and we are assessing how we should proceed, including land identification and the facilities required.\n\nWith the latest SHANTI Bill and the regulations that will follow, we expect more competitive proposals from foreign technology providers and potential collaborators. We are looking for the right partner.\n\nWe have identified a few states for potential nuclear projects and are in discussions with them.\n\n5) What is your capex target for this and the next fiscal?\n\nWe have been doing a capex of Rs 35-40,000 crore per year. It will be in the same range for FY27 too.\n\n6) What are your key priority areas in the renewable energy segment? How much RE capacity are you targeting?\n\nIn renewables, we’re building across the spectrum, solar, wind, CBG, 3G ethanol, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and green hydrogen.\n\nWe are setting up what will be India’s largest green hydrogen plant, with capacity of 10,000 tonnes per annum, targeted to be ready by December 2027. We are also the only company in the country with a licence to produce and dispense SAF, and we expect SAF dispensing to begin by June 2026.\n\nOverall, we are targeting 18 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030.\n\n7) What were the key discussions during the CEO roundtable with the prime minister during the India Energy Week?\n\nKey discussions were that we were encouraged to go for transitional pathways because we have been inculcating that dialogue that we have to work on non-fossil forms of energy. So he has encouraged that. And at the same time, he has said that we have to improve on upstream, we have to look for ways and means where we can, we can increase our in-house production of crude, plus he has encouraged us to work on improving our supply chains. He has given emphasis on the gas economy. He has given emphasis on Make in India and how we can increase production of petrochemicals, chemicals, and gas usage. He emphasised on how we can give more and more emphasis on improving the cost structure of our supply chain.",

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey’s observations on compute and AI portend potentially significant developments in the upcoming Budget. First, it flags concerns raised by theFinancial Timesabout off-balance-sheet leverage in global AI investments, alongside skepticism expressed by IBM’s CEO regarding the financial viability of large-scale data center expansion. Second, it highlights that the demands data centers place on water, energy, and finance may be difficult to reconcile with India’s economic and existential realities, where steady access to these basic amenities is still not universal. Taken together, these signals suggest that Budget 2026 is unlikely to offer subsidies or major outlays for data centers. This presents a unique opportunity for India to reimagine its conception of technological sovereignty.\n\nIn a digital economy typified by cross-border and multi-directional data flows, technological sovereignty need not hinge on physical localisation, but on predictability. Until now, the idea of technological sovereignty in India has largely meant building as much as possible domestically, and forcing localization where it was not. Ratcheting up the number of home-grown data centers fed into this vision.\n\nThe goal of localisation was understandable. They were originally driven by a quest for seamless access to data for law enforcement, which was often stymied by an antiquated and broken international data-sharing regime under Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties. They continue to be reinforced by anti-globalist sentiments, both at home and internationally.\n\nHowever, these sentiments render the quest for self-reliance incompatible with the nature of digital flows today. Digital information flows cannot be reduced to a zero-sum game, where data moving into or out of a country is viewed as a net loss or gain.\n\nIndia's Digital Ecosystem and Global Synergies\n\nResearch has shown, for instance, that large digital platforms create significant opportunities for Indian MSMEs, in terms of both revenue generation and customer acquisition, domestically as well as internationally. The network through which a domestic firm reaches a global customer may be foreign, but the service provided is wholly Indian. Similar mutualism exists across the AI stack. While infrastructure and models may originate with international or domestic firms, Indian companies are the ones building applications on top of them.\n\nHere again, research shows thatfirms derive value from multiplicity in AI infrastructureand are careful to avoid lock-in to any single architecture. Data gathered by the Esya Centre from start-ups indicates that AI developersroutinely multi-home across clouds and models—an effective way to limit capital intensity while still capturing the benefits of advanced infrastructure.\n\nLessons for Start-up Ecosystem\n\nThese synergies are often ignored when technological sovereignty is reduced to a static ledger of national credits and debits, where outward digital flows are automatically treated as a loss to the national interest rather than as an enabler of economic value and global integration.\n\nA reimagined conception of technological sovereignty for India must begin with trust. Businesses value certainty, even more so in a global environment marked by policy volatility and erratic decision-making. Singapore offers a useful illustration. Despite its small size, it has emerged as the second-largest innovation hub in Asia and ninth globally, attracting start-ups from around the world, including India.\n\nA 2022 report by the Asian Development Bank notes that thisinflux has been driven by startup- and investor-friendly policies, alongside an unwavering commitment to the rule of law. Tax certainty—including the absence of capital gains tax on investments—combined with a co-investment model in which the government invested alongside venture funds, helped crowd in private capital. Importantly, this approach also allowed the state to leverage the market expertise and risk-assessment capabilities of private investors, who are often better positioned than government agencies to evaluate fast-moving technology sectors.\n\nProximity to capital, coupled with clear and credible rules of the road, in turn drew start-ups to Singapore’s ecosystem. There is also evidence to suggest that investors themselves encouraged firms to relocate or incorporate there, so they could benefit from the legal and institutional assurances offered by a stable jurisdiction.\n\nIndia could orient itself in a similar direction. Doing so, however, requires resisting the temptation to dilute or reverse institutional and legal commitments once made. Episodes such as the Tiger Global dispute are one example, but more recent decisions—such as accelerating the compliance timeline for certain entities under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act from 18 months to 12—also raise concerns. Data protection frameworks are complex to implement, and most jurisdictions globally have allowed at least two years for compliance with comparable regimes.\n\nNavigating AI Regulation with Trust and Predictability\n\nIn the context of AI, the Economic Survey rightly notes that India must still determine how best to regulate the technology. Here too, trust should serve as the lodestar. This implies avoiding unnecessary compliance burdens or reactionary rule-making—such as the advisory issued in March 2024 that sought toeffectively impose a licensing regimeon all generative AI systems.\n\nTrust enables digital flows through a country, and these flows enable the capture of value. This should be the modern conception of technological sovereignty for India—one that complements, rather than conflicts with, the country’s strengths as a hub of technical talent, ingenuity, and robust digital connectivity.\n\n(Meghna Balis the Director of the Esya Centre, a tech policy think tank.)\n\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

The decline triggered volatility across the crypto market, with over $1.7 billion in leveraged positions liquidated during the period.\n\n\"The decline followed a broader global risk-off move triggered by weak tech earnings and a sudden pullback in gold and silver after both hit record highs. Data shows the drop was driven mainly by futures deleveraging, not sustained spot selling,\" said Riya Sehgal, research analyst, Delta Exchange.\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk said in its daily brief that bitcoin is likely to consolidate in the near-term, as weaker leverage has been flushed, reducing immediate downside pressure. \"However, a decisive break below $82K could expose $79K–$80K, while sustained upside requires acceptance above $88,500, supported by improving spot demand and ETF flows,\" they said.\n\nEthereum was down 6.97 percent, Tehter 0.01 percent, XRP 6.20 percent, Solana 6.37 percent, Dogecoin 5.77  percent, Cardano 6.33, BNB 5.48 percent, USDC 0.02 percent, and Tron lost 0.86 percent in the past 24 hours.\n\n\"Amid the bearish wave, a few altcoins like LayerZero and Canton lead the top gainers by 7.45 percent and 6.78 percent jump, followed by DoubleZero and Morpho with minor gains. Besides, Worldcoin and Lighter plunged more than 14 percent each, followed by Chiliz with 13 percent and Hyperliquid and Mantle by over 11 percent each,\" said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\nHere's how the price of cryptocurrencies moved on January 30 as of 11:08 am IST.\n\n\"The crypto market saw a sharp pullback alongside equities and gold as rising US–Iran tensions and renewed concerns over a potential US government shutdown pushed investors into risk-off mode ,\" said Akshat Siddhant, lead quant analyst, Mudrex. Bitcoin presents an attractive opportunity for long-term investors, where gradual, disciplined accumulation can help achieve better risk-adjusted returns over time. Traders should closely watch the $80,600 support level, as a break below it could trigger further downward pressure.\n\nAccording to WazirX founder Nischal Shetty, bitcoin's drop was largely driven by the liquidation of excess leverage, with over $777 million in long positions liquidated in just one hour. This shows a broader reaction to macroeconomic developments, which have been triggering outsized moves in risk-on assets.",

        "full_content": "The shares of metals-to-oil conglomerateVedantadropped more than 8 percent on January 30 after the company released its results for the third quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. Brokerages have mixed views for the stock.\n\nThe shares of the company dropped to Rs 702.4 apiece in the morning trading hours of Friday to snap a six-session gaining streak. This comes a day after the stock hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 769.80 apiece.\n\nNotably, today’s sharp fall in Vedanta’s share price also comes amid a broader downturn in metal stocks, buoyed by profit booking, falling metal prices and speculation of a hawkish Federal Reserve Governor. The Nifty Metal index tumbled nearly 5 percent today.\n\nVedanta on January 29 reported a consolidatednet profit of Rs 5,710 crorefor the October-December quarter of FY26, marking a 61 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump from the Rs 3,547 crore net profit reported in the same period of the previous financial year.\n\nThe firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose 37 percent YoY to Rs 23,369 crore during the quarter under review. “Q3 FY26 has been a landmark quarter for Vedanta, delivering our highest-ever EBITDA of ₹15,171 crore, with two of our businesses achieving their best-ever financial results. Aluminium posted its strongest EBITDA margin of $1,268 per ton, supported by record alumina and aluminium production. Zinc India recorded its highest-ever quarterly EBITDA of ₹6,064 crore, driven by record mined and refined metal output, with silver contributing 44% of overall profit. Zinc International also reported a 28% YoY increase in production, led by Gamsberg achieving its highest-ever recovery,” said Arun Misra, Executive Director, Vedanta.\n\n“Our Oil & Gas business reached a major milestone with India’s first subsea template installation, while our Thermal Power Business delivered 188% YoY EBITDA growth with a 62% increase in sales volumes. Steel and Ferrochrome Business also achieved record production of steel billets at 285 kt, and ferrochrome output up 32% YoY,” he added.\n\nICICI Direct Research said that Vedanta’s overall performance for the quarter was aided by higher aluminium, zinc and silver prices, but any cool-off in non-ferrous metal prices and silver could potentially led to stock price decline.\n\nMotilal Oswal Financial Services kept a ‘Neutral’ rating on the shares of Vedanta, with a target price of Rs 810 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 6 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 766.35 apiece.\n\nThe domestic brokerage said that Vedanta’s Q3 operational performance came largely as expected, supported by better volumes and favorable LME prices. “Capex plans are progressing well and will likely lead to further cost savings. Management targets to maintain strong growth in earnings, led by the upcoming capacity, which will produce higher VAP products. VEDL remains firm on its deleveraging plans, and going forward, higher cash flows will support both its expansion plans and deleveraging efforts,” it added.\n\nThe stock currently trades at 7x EV/EBITDA and 4.4x P/BV on the FY27 estimate, Motilal said.\n\nEmkay Global kept a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, and increased its target price over 21 percent to Rs 850 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that the firm’s strong Q3 results were driven by higher aluminium and zinc profitability.\n\n“We continue to believe that if there was ever a better time in the past decade to own exposure to industrial metals, it is now,” it added.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "Copper sank from a record at the end of an extraordinarily volatile week, with trading marred by an glitch on the London Metal Exchange, as Chinese investors pulled back and the US dollar rose.\n\nBenchmark three-month futures dropped almost 4% to near $13,000 a ton on the LME, after peaking above $14,500 on Thursday. Still, copper remains on course for a solid weekly gain, the sixth in the past seven.\n\nWith global investors focused on metals after a series of major price swings in commodities, the LME — the trading venue that has set global prices for base metals for more than a century — suffered a one-hour delay to the start of trade due to technical issues.\n\nCopper has surged in the opening weeks of the new year, caught up in a wave of enthusiasm for base and precious metals that’s been especially evident in China, Asia’s largest economy and the leading consumer. The frenzy has been supercharged by optimism about demand given the energy transition, as well as a steady weakening in the US dollar, which hit a four-year low.\n\n“The market’s expectations have become too uniform at this stage and need some adjustment,” said Jerry Zhang, a trader at Ningbo Meishan Bonded Port Hongyi Investment Management Partnership Co. “Volatility has also become quite high, so we prefer to control risk and avoid participating too much.”\n\nThe US dollar rose on Friday — making commodities less attractive for many investors — amid speculation that the Trump administration is preparing for the president to nominate Kevin Warsh to be the next Federal Reserve chair.\n\nCopper traded 1.7% lower at $13,383 a ton on the LME at 12:36 p.m. in Singapore. The five other base-metal contracts — for aluminum, zinc, lead, nickel and tin — were all lower on the day.\n\nElsewhere, gold, silver, crude oil and iron ore also declined.\n\nThe rush into copper — as well as other base metals — lifted the catch-all LMEX Index to a record on Thursday, topping the peak that was set in 2022.\n\nCopper — a mainstay metal for wiring and batteries — has been in focus in recent quarters amid mine snarls, concerns about possible US import levies, and the outlook for demand given the global push for electrification.\n\nWhile prices remain on course for a weekly gain, some metrics suggest that near-term conditions are not tight. The spread between cash prices and three-month futures is more than $90 a ton in contango, a bearish pattern.\n\nAhead of Friday’s moves, Citigroup Inc. flagged copper may rally further in the near term, while also cautioning that resistance from physical users facing higher costs could be a drag over the full year.\n\nAlthough a jump for copper to $15,000 to $16,000 “does not look implausible,” the base case remained for a greater physical-market pushback, and that would mean copper averages $13,000 in 2026, the Citi analysts said.",

        "full_content": "New Fund Offers (NFOs) are back in the spotlight with thematic, factor-based and sector-specific funds dominating the list. While they present a wider choice, should you invest in an NFO just because it’s new?\n\n“The surge in NFOs, as of January 2026, indicates a clear shift in the Indian mutual fund landscape. Strategies of asset management companies are moving away from broad category fillers,” said Anup Bhaiya, founder, Money Honey Financial Services. Fund houses are trying to capture investor appetite through thematic, factor-based (Smart Beta), and sector-specific products, he said.\n\nAccording to the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), 23 new open-ended funds were launched in December, led by equity-oriented schemes, followed by hybrid schemes, raising Rs 4,074 crore. Overall, total inflows from NFOs for the calendar year 2025 stood at Rs 3.03 lakh crore.\n\nThe recent NFOs are mostly open-ended, allowing investors flexibility to buy or sell shares at the fund's current net asset value (NAV), without a cap on maturity or units. The latest NFOs seek to gather shareholders’ focus across thematic, factor-based (Smart Beta), and sector-specific funds.\n\nThematic funds offer exposure to infrastructure, defence, clean energy, digitalisation, and banking, to name a few. They are suited for investors who have a high risk appetite and can be explored on a limited basis with an allocation of 5-10 percent, say experts.\n\nThematic funds differ from sector-specific funds, as they invest across multiple sectors. Sectoral funds focus on a single industry. According to the latest AMFI data, there were 238 thematic (and sectoral) mutual funds with a total assets under management (AUM) of Rs 5.37 lakh crore as on December 31.\n\nAccording to Bhaiya, four of the 11 listed NFOs in January focus on financial services or consumption. “AMCs are betting heavily on the structural India story. They are carving out niches within sectors, like services versus banking. There has also been a significant rise in Index Funds and ETFs (Axis, Groww, Kotak), as investors increasingly look for lower-cost ways to participate in the market without manager risk.”\n\nFactor-based funds, or so-called smart beta funds, invest in a stocks using certain pre-set filters or rules to build portfolios. They take into account factors such as value, growth, quality and momentum while making investment decisions.\n\nExamples from the latest NFOs include funds like SBI Quality and Kotak Value. “It signifies that AMCs are moving beyond simple stock picking. They are now offering a rules-based strategy that targets specific traits like quality, low volatility, or value,” Bhaiya said.\n\nFinancial advisers suggest investors avoid short-term trends and align their investment with their financial goals, time horizon and risk appetite. Look for funds that are data-driven, evidence-based and offer controlled risk management when choosing NFOs, they say.",

        "full_content": "The London Metal Exchange suffered a one-hour delay to the start of trading on Friday after a technical problem, causing confusion among traders after a week of intense volatility and eye-watering price gains.\n\nElectronic trading on the world’s biggest metals bourse — which sets global prices for vital commodities from copper to zinc and aluminum — got underway belatedly at 10:00 a.m. Hong Kong time.\n\nThe delay came at a moment when nerves have been fraying in metals markets as participants cope with sudden and extreme moves. On Thursday, LME copper jumped 11%, its biggest intraday gain since 2008, to hit a record above $14,500 a ton.\n\nSeveral traders said there was already speculation on Friday over who might be sitting on losses when many received a notice from the LME announcing the hold-up. A prolonged outage could have complicated issues for those wanting to exit positions.\n\nCalls to the LME officials in London were not answered outside working hours. A spokesman for Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., which owns the LME, did not have an immediate comment on the incident.\n\nTrading pauses or delays are not entirely unheard of across global exchanges. A major data center malfunction took down markets operated by CME Group Inc. for more than 10 hours in December, halting trading across equities, foreign exchange, bonds and commodities.\n\nBut reliability has been a major focus for the LME since 2022, when a crisis in the nickel market triggered by a massive short squeeze led to some trades being declared void. That episode prompted an overhaul of regulations.\n\nGlobal metals markets have enjoyed a dramatic start to 2026, fueled by an intense wave of speculative trading, especially in China. The Shanghai Futures Exchange is having its busiest ever month in volume terms for six base metals, and frenzied trading there has driven LME prices higher.\n\nAfter the LME opened on Friday, copper fell as much 3.9%, with other metals also dropping. That followed declines during the previous hour on the SHFE.",

Interestingly, domestic prices fell more than international prices yesterday, raising price parity concerns. While the USDINR market reached a record high, the Dollar index also reversed once again from recent lows of 96,\" said Manav Modi, Commodities Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.\n\nGold prices vary by purity. Check the prices of gold based on its purity:\n\nCity-wise gold prices in India today\n\nGold rates across India’s major cities showed remarkable uniformity, with only marginal differences due to local taxes, jeweller margins, and logistics costs.\n\nAccording to Modi, the sharp rally has already pushed some physical buyers to the sidelines, with the World Gold Council noting that central bank purchases moderated in Q4 2025, although strong investor inflows more than offset the slowdown.\n\n\"The council also warned that India’s gold imports are likely to decline this year as record prices weigh on jewellery demand in the world’s second-largest consumer. Despite the pullback, gold remains on track for its strongest monthly performance since the 1980s, underpinned by persistent economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Tensions remain elevated after US President Trump urged Iran to negotiate a nuclear deal, prompting threats of retaliation from Tehran,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve held rates steady, with markets still expecting a first rate cut in June as investors await the announcement of a new Fed chair to succeed Jerome Powell in May. On the data front, US consumer confidence and weekly jobless claims supported bullions rally. Factory order data was reported better than expectations. Focus today will be on the US PPI data, he said.\n\nThe Augmont Bullion report, published on January 29, said that gold’s surge beyond $5,600 (₹1,80,000) reflects a deepening macro and geopolitical risk premium rather than short-term speculation. Sustaining above $5600 (Rs 1,87,000) opens the door to $5800–$6000 (Rs 1,87,000–1,95,000). Strong support at $5200 (Rs 1,60,000), a break could trigger profit-booking toward $5,000–$4,750.\n\nGold prices typically fall when the dollar strengthens. When the dollar gains value, it becomes more expensive for individuals and institutions using other currencies to purchase the same amount of gold, which tends to reduce demand and thus the price.",

She however added that despite price swings, fundamentals are compelling, driven by near-record industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles, and AI infrastructure.\n\nKanchan however cautioned that after such explosive gains in 2025, timing a single entry point is “treacherous”. “Rather than deploying capital all at once, investors should consider spreading purchases over the coming weeks or months. This approach captures the dip while protecting against further corrections that could see silver test,” she said.\n\nFor conservative investors, allocating 5-10 percent of portfolios to precious metals ETFs through systematic purchases reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to an asset class that benefits from geopolitical instability and monetary policy uncertainty, according to the expert.\n\nWith structural drivers such as central-bank accumulation, long-term demand and inflation hedging undiminished, disciplined investors may see this correction as a strategic accumulation zone, but should avoid aggressive short-term speculation given ongoing volatility, Khoo from VT Market said.\n\nNirpendra Yadav, Senior Commodity Research Analyst at Bonanza, said that with global uncertainties, central bank gold accumulation, and expectations of softer real interest rates over the medium term, gold continues to play an important portfolio-hedging and diversification role.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "India enters 2026 on a relatively firm economic footing. Growth has held up in a difficult global environment. Public investment has expanded capacity. Corporate balance sheets are healthier than they were a few years ago. And, for the most part, policy has become more predictable.\n\nYet speak to business leaders across sectors, and a quieter concern surfaces. Compliance has become easier. Approvals are more transparent. But operating costs remain stubbornly high. The friction has shifted, not disappeared.\n\nThis is the more interesting business story buried in the Economic Survey 2025–26, which repeatedly points to a less visible constraint: system-level input costs. Not just the cost of capital, but energy, freight, logistics pricing, upstream materials, and the way climate transition costs are layered onto firms. Together, these costs are beginning to shape competitiveness more than regulation or taxation.\n\nIn simple terms, India has reduced many of the visible barriers to doing business. The harder work now lies in fixing the invisible ones.\n\nInfrastructure pricing hasn’t caught up\n\nLogistics is often cited as a success story and rightly so. Highways, freight corridors, ports, and digital coordination platforms have expanded rapidly. The Survey acknowledges these gains and notes improvements in logistics efficiency over recent years.\n\nBut it also flags something businesses encounter every day: pricing still distorts behaviour. Rail freight, for instance, continues to be cross-subsidised in ways that raise tariffs for industrial users. Predictably, cargo shifts back to roads, eroding efficiency gains and pushing up costs across the system.\n\nThe contrast with global peers is telling. Rail accounts for roughly a quarter to a third of freight movement in India, compared to 40–50 per cent in many large manufacturing economies. This is not simply about building more tracks. It is about how incentives are structured and prices are set. For firms operating on thin margins, reliability and predictability matter as much as physical capacity.\n\nThe Survey is unusually candid on electricity pricing. It explains how cross-subsidisation in power distribution loads higher tariffs onto industrial and commercial users to offset lower tariffs elsewhere. In many states, industrial tariffs remain materially above the average supply cost.\n\nThat matters because electricity is not a niche input. It underpins manufacturing, cold chains, healthcare facilities, data centres, and an increasingly digital services economy. Availability has improved. Outages are fewer. But pricing still penalises precisely those users who need scale and efficiency to compete globally.\n\nReforms to move toward more cost-reflective tariffs are underway, and that direction is important. Until then, power will continue to be a quiet but persistent drag on competitiveness.\n\nClimate transition can raise costs\n\nMuch of the public discussion around the climate transition assumes competitiveness will follow automatically. The Economic Survey itself is careful not to make that assumption. While it does not directly link net-zero pathways to input-cost distortions, it does underscore the importance of sequencing, system readiness, and cost discipline in sustaining growth.\n\nThe risk, therefore, lies not in ambition but in design. If climate mandates are rolled out faster than grids are strengthened, transition finance deepened, and pricing structures rationalised, they could add to existing cost pressures before productivity gains materialise. For export-oriented firms, that timing mismatch matters.\n\nCapital cost reflects more than interest rates\n\nOne of the Survey’s more under-appreciated arguments concerns capital costs. It suggests that India’s relatively high cost of capital cannot be explained by monetary policy or financial depth alone. Instead, it links capital costs to structural factors, notably India’s reliance on foreign savings because of a persistent current account deficit.\n\nEconomies that depend on external capital carry a risk premium, and that premium is reflected in borrowing costs. This helps explain why long-term capital in India continues to trade at a premium to some peers with similar credit ratings, despite strong growth prospects.\n\nFor businesses, the implication is straightforward. Cheaper capital is not just a banking-sector issue. It is also about export depth and external resilience. Corporate strategies that remain import-heavy or inward-looking may make sense individually, but collectively they reinforce the macro conditions that keep capital expensive for everyone.\n\nWhen protection quietly becomes fragility\n\nThe Survey is refreshingly direct on industrial policy trade-offs. It warns that protection in upstream sectors such as steel, aluminium, and textile fibres often amounts to a tax on downstream manufacturers, particularly exporters. Decisions about what not to protect, it argues, can be just as important as decisions about what to support.\n\nIn a fragmented global economy, protection can feel reassuring. Over time, however, it raises input costs, discourages scale, and weakens competitiveness. Firms disciplined by global prices may ultimately be more resilient than those shielded from them.\n\nThe Survey goes a step further, noting that where upstream sectors are capital-intensive, lowering the cost of capital is a more efficient form of support than raising import barriers, precisely because it preserves downstream competitiveness.\n\nNext reform frontier is cost discipline\n\nNone of this diminishes India’s growth story. The Survey itself is optimistic about medium-term prospects. But it does suggest that the next phase of reform will be less visible and more difficult. It will focus on pricing structures, sequencing, and system-wide efficiency rather than on headline announcements.\n\nFor policymakers, that means aligning energy pricing, logistics tariffs, climate transition finance, and trade policy with competitiveness outcomes. For business leaders, it means recognising that firm-level optimisation is no longer enough.Cost structure is now a strategy.\n\nIndia has done the hard work of removing many obvious barriers to growth. The challenge ahead lies in fixing the quieter ones, the costs embedded in systems that compound across sectors. If those are addressed with the same seriousness as past reforms, India’s growth story will not just endure; it will thrive.\n\n(Suryaprabha Sadasivan, Senior Vice President, Chase Advisors.)\n\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "The Metropolitan Stock Exchange (MSE) is making a comeback. Powered by an upgraded engine and backed by more than Rs 1,200-crore from fintech investors, MSE aims to challenge the duopoly of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and BSE.\n\nAfter a long break, MSE resumed trading on January 27. Building on this momentum, MSE will hold a special trading session on February 1, to coincide with the presentation of the Union Budget 2026.\n\n“A relaunch typically reflects upgraded systems, improved governance, increased transparency, and renewed efforts to rebuild trust and relevance in the market. The process involves fixing previous system flaws to meet present market requirements instead of creating an entirely new system,” said Piyush Jhunjhunwala, CEO & Founder, Stockify.\n\nFounded in 2008, the MSE launched its currency derivatives segment on October 7 that year. Originally called MCX-SX, it was rebranded in 2015 and subsequently gained recognition from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to operate in multiple segments, including currency derivatives, debt securities, equities, and equity derivatives.\n\nA lot has changed since MSE’s earlier avatar. Digital infrastructure has improved dramatically and regulatory framework is far stronger, which, along with a growing economy, have seen a huge growth in investor base.\n\nWere investors aware of it earlier?\n\nInvestor awareness was poor as financial literacy stayed low and marketing efforts failed. Retail investors, who depended on traditional brokerage services and major stock exchanges, paid little attention to other trading platforms.\n\nIn the past, information was distributed through slow methods that relied mostly on physical channels. Investors now use social media platforms and financial applications together with online news websites and digital marketing campaigns to discover investment opportunities, Jhunjhunwala said. Both regulators and institutions work together to support programmes that educate investors. Public awareness has increased through the efforts of organisations that set up platforms that citizens can access, he said.\n\nWith fewer listed companies and products, investors may find it difficult to build a diversified portfolio on MSE compared with what is available on NSE or BSE.\n\nOne major concern is liquidity. The MSE trading platform experiences lower trading activity because its market participants buy and sell securities less frequently than they do on bigger platforms. The situation creates challenges for investors who want to buy or sell assets because they must deal with price changes, which can result in financial losses without warning.\n\nAnkur Punj, MD and Business Head, Equirus Wealth, said, “With a limited universe of listed companies, diversification options are narrower, and trading volumes tend to be thinner, which can increase volatility and make exits challenging during stressed market conditions.”\n\nJhunjhunwala said the current issue involves two main aspects. The existence of stock trading on smaller exchanges needs to be understood because it results in reduced research coverage from analysts, institutional investors, and financial media outlets for those stocks that trade on every actively traded market.\n\n“Retail investors have limited access to reliable information, making it difficult to assess a company's true value and economic position. The information gap leads to decisions that rely more on guesswork instead of trustworthy fundamental data,” he said.\n\nCompanies that operate on these platforms sometimes are in earlier development stages because they fail to fulfil the strict requirements needed for listing on larger exchanges. The situation creates new possibilities but increases the likelihood of governance problems and inconsistent business disclosures, thereby, raising operational threats to the organisation.\n\n“The major exchanges provide better security for investors because they establish stricter rules and offer more financial resources and superior investor safeguards. The MSE platform supports specific trading strategies and short-term market movements, yet it does not function as an effective platform for building long-term financial assets,\" Jhunjhunwala said.\n\nAccording to the experts, MSE can still be relevant for sophisticated investors who understand liquidity risk and are willing to take selective, long-term exposure to specific companies.\n\n“The present day shows a distinct change compared to the previous period. The previous period had limited participation because there were only a few registered companies and the market had low trading activity and weak trading capacity. Businesses showed a preference for established markets because these platforms provided better visibility and increased investor trust,” said Jhunjhunwala.\n\nMore companies, especially SMEs and startups, are entering the capital market. Digital onboarding, faster compliance processes and simplified listing procedures have resulted in increased participation. “Investors now possess improved access to data and analytics and real-time information, which leads to better decision-making. The market has progressed toward greater inclusivity, transparency, and competitive business practices,\" experts said.\n\nShould retail investors dive into the MSE trade\n\nRetail investors looking to build long-term wealth are being urged by experts to think carefully before placing bets on the Metropolitan Stock Exchange, as concerns about its scale, liquidity, and ability to compete with the NSE and the BSE remain.\n\nKranthi Bathini, Equity Strategist at WealthMills Securities Pvt Ltd, said, “In the equity space, we already have very strong and well-established players, with NSE as the clear market leader and BSE in second place. At this stage, the scope for a third exchange is very limited.”\n\nBathini said the MSE is not new,  it was earlier known as MCX-SX and has only changed its name. Winning back investor confidence will take time and it will be crucial.\n\nThere is some speculation in the unlisted space because of valuations but NSE has a very strong presence and steady cash flows. “For MSE, increasing its market presence and trading volumes will be crucial. This is a high-risk option and is suitable only for investors with a high-risk appetite,” said Bathini.\n\nFor those focused on steady wealth creation, established exchanges continue to offer deeper markets, better liquidity and stronger investor protection. Until MSE proves it can attract large volumes and listings, caution is likely to remain the wiser course.\n\n“For most retail investors, however, larger exchanges offer a more stable and transparent ecosystem that is better suited to systematic wealth creation,” Punj said.",

        "full_content": "Wondering if you can continue using Income Tax Return(ITR) Form 1 after living outside India for more than 182 days in a financial year? Today’s Ask Wallet Wise explains how the ITR 1 is treated done under the Income Tax Act.\n\nAsk Wallet-Wise initiative offers expert advice on matters related to personal finance and money-related queries. You can email your queries to askwalletwise@nw18.com, and we will try to get a top financial expert to address.\n\nCan I continue using Form ITR-1 if I stay outside India for more than 182 days and attain NRI status during that financial year? I have a \"Long Term Visitor Pass\" visa for Singapore, which does not allow me to earn income during my stay. Also, suggest should I check the \"resident\" or the \"non-resident\" option while filing ITR-1 Form.\n\nExpert’s Advice:The ITR form, along with the relevant rules, is notified every year by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) after the end of the financial year. So, for the current fiscal, the rules prescribing the criteria and the relevant ITR form will be available only after the CBDT notifies them after March 31, 2026.\n\nThe ITR-1 form is used by the majority of taxpayers. However, one of the restrictions is regarding the residential status of the individual for the financial year for which the ITR is to be filed. The Income Tax laws do not permit a non-resident individual to use the ITR 1 form. The use of an ITR form is not dependent on the visa status but on the physical stay of the person in India. It is also not dependent on whether you’re earning any income during your stay outside India.\n\nUnder the Income Tax law, a person is treated as a non-resident if they have been in India for less than 182 days. Since you will be outside India for more than 182 days, you become ineligible to use ITR Form 1. The question of resident or non-resident does not arise here. While using other applicable ITR forms, you will have to select your status as non-resident and the reason being physically outside India for more than 182 days.",

        "full_content": "Asian investors are pouring record amounts into gold exchange-traded funds, leading some to question whether the rally in bullion is getting close to topping out.\n\nPrecious metals ETFs listed in the region have attracted $7.1 billion in net inflows in January, with a number drawing in all-time amounts of capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest gains were seen by funds listed in China that cater to retail investors, with Huaan Yifu Gold ETF alone luring in $1.9 billion.\n\nThe price of bullion has skyrocketed is recent weeks, with the yellow metal advancing more than 20% since the start of January, despite a pullback on Friday. High levels of buying by retail investors is often seen as a sign a rally is in its later stages and an asset is overvalued.\n\n“We have been major gold bulls in this cycle,” buying both gold-mining stocks and ETFs, said Nick Ferres, chief investment officer at Vantage Point Asset Management in Singapore. “However, the recent price action has become rapid, emotional and non-linear, which is a warning sign that the trend is extended tactically.”\n\nGold’s breakneck rally has been underpinned by elevated central-bank purchases and inflows into bullion-backed ETFs. Total holdings in gold-backed funds rose every month last year except May, according to World Gold Council data. Precious metals have also benefited from a switch away from the dollar due to unpredictable US policymaking and increasing American isolation.\n\nAmid other warnings signs, gold’s relative strength index has climbed to about 90, above the level of 70 that is taken to indicate a pullback is overdue. A successful outcome from policies set by the Trump administration would accelerate economic growth, leading to higher interest rates and a stronger US dollar, pushing gold lower, the World Gold Council said in its 2026 outlook published last month.\n\nAmong other China-listed funds that have seen sizable inflows in January, the ChinaAMC Gold ETF drew in $420 million, while the GF Shanghai Gold ETF attracted $191.4 million, both set for records, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nSome silver-focused Asian ETFs are also heading for monthly inflow records. South Korea-listed Samsung KODEX Silver Futures Special Asset ETF has gained $231.6 million in net inflows for January, also set for a record.\n\nIn another sign of frenzied demand, China’s only pure-play silver fund — the UBS SDIC Silver Futures Fund LOF — paused subscriptions on Wednesday and halted trading Friday, after massive inflows drove the fund to an elevated premium over its underlying assets.\n\nAsset management companies are set to respond to the rising demand for gold ETFs by bringing new products to the market, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n“ETF issuers are likely to tap demand for safe-haven assets with more gold-related funds,” analysts Rebecca Sin and Michelle Leung wrote in a research note. “Hong Kong, which offers tools ranging from low-cost physical tracking to leveraged futures and mining equities, has two new listings this week as it seeks to strengthen its position as a gold trading hub.”",

These forums focus on strengthening cooperation and addressing barriers affecting cross-border space trade and joint missions.\n\nA questionnaire has been circulated to the industry which seeks detailed responses on regulatory and licensing obstacles encountered by Indian firms selling space hardware, software and services to US customers.\n\nThese include issues related to export licences, payload approvals, data restrictions and certification requirements.\n\nA key area of focus is the impact of US export control regimes such as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and rules governing the use of US-origin components.\n\nIN-SPACe has asked companies to highlight what specific relaxations or clarifications could improve the process of making deals with American partners.\n\nAccording to sources, IN-SPACe has also asked which US approval processes, including launch permissions, satellite licensing, and so on could be reformed to encourage stronger India–US partnerships.\n\nStartups have also been asked to suggest mechanisms that could help Indian firms be recognised as \"trusted suppliers\" for sensitive US space supply chains. These include certifications, secure facilities, compliance frameworks and audit systems.\n\nCompanies have also been asked whether India's current intellectual property, data-sharing and co-development rules are flexible to support research and development with US firms.\n\nThis outreach by IN-SPACe marks a shift by New Delhi to translate diplomatic goodwill into market access for Indian firms. By gathering empirical data on US regulatory bottlenecks, India is arming itself with the evidence needed to challenge legacy export controls and licensing barriers at upcoming trade talks.",

The S&P 500 closed well above its session low but still ended the day down 9.02 points, or 0.13%, at 6,969.01.\n\nYields on the 10-year Treasury up 3 basis points at 4.26 percent, while the yields on 2-year US Treasuries were up marginally at 3.56 percent.\n\nPresident Trump’s comments that he plans to announce his nomination for the next Fed chair have helped to support the US dollar as it climbs ~0.4% against the yen, euro and other major peers.\n\nAsian currencies were trading lower in the early trade on Friday with Thai Baht leading the losers followed by Japanese Yen, Malaysian Ringgit, Singapore Dollar.\n\nOil prices are headed for their biggest monthly gains in years on Friday as tensions in the Middle East escalated over a possible U.S. attack on Iran that could disrupt supplies from one of the biggest OPEC producers.\n\nGold prices fell on Friday, pressured by a firmer dollar, but were set for their biggest monthly gain since 1980 as investors piled into the safe-haven metal amid persistent geopolitical and economic uncertainties.\n\nOn January 29, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold shares worth Rs 393 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) purchased equities of Rs 2638 crore in the market.\n\nHope you're all set for today's trade.

        "full_content": "The benchmark indices added 0.3 percent gains and maintained an uptrend for three consecutive sessions on January 29, but market breadth turned negative. About 1,717 shares declined against 1,205 advancing shares on the NSE. The market may see range-bound trading ahead of the Union Budget scheduled on February 1. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:\n\nJay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services\n\nNTPC consolidated in a long-term wedge since April 2025. After breaking above the wedge, it traded sideways in a rectangular range. The latest session delivered a strong breakout above this range on robust positive volume, confirming buyer conviction.\n\nThe price now trades above all key EMAs with upward slopes. The RSI holds support at 50 on both daily and weekly charts, supporting continued bullish momentum. The structure remains firmly bullish while support holds.\n\nIpca Laboratories| CMP: Rs 1,479.7\n\nIpca Laboratories broke out from a prolonged triangular consolidation (from January 2–9, 2026), gaining 13.6 percent while broader indices fell around 2.5 percent, showing clear relative strength. The breakout was backed by strong volume. The stock is now retesting the breakout zone and formed a dragonfly doji on January 21, signalling throwback exhaustion. Support has been defended for the third time.\n\nMomentum indicators remain bullish and rising. The price is trading above short-, medium-, and long-term EMAs. Repeated support defence and relative strength point to a high-probability reversal. Adding more above Rs 1,525 could propel the bullish move.\n\nNMDC broke out above a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on December 23 from Rs 78.6, rallying to Rs 86.72 before correcting. The pullback found support at the 100-day EMA and successfully retested the breakout zone.\n\nThe latest bounce formed a strong three white soldiers pattern with rising positive volume, confirming accumulation. The price trades above all key EMAs with upward slopes. Momentum indicators align bullishly, and the structure favours buyers as long as the 100-day EMA holds.\n\nOm Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities\n\nMishra Dhatu Nigam| CMP: Rs 387.5\n\nMishra Dhatu Nigam has shown a sharp pickup in momentum and is now attempting to break above a long-standing downward trendline on the daily chart. The stock has moved decisively higher and is trading above its short-term moving average, indicating improving strength. Volumes have remained stable alongside the rise in price.\n\nThe daily RSI is placed near 66, highlighting strengthening momentum. The DMI setup shows the positive directional line above the negative line, while the ADX remains elevated, confirming improving trend strength. As long as the stock sustains above the Rs 360 zone, the near-term outlook remains positive.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation| CMP: Rs 366.95\n\nBPCL has bounced back from a triple bottom pattern after a corrective phase. The stock is now holding above the previous resistance zone and is attempting to move higher from the Rs 360–365 area. It is trading above its short- and medium-term moving averages and has reclaimed the mid-Bollinger band.\n\nThe daily RSI is placed near the 55 level. The rate of change indicator remains in positive territory, supporting the ongoing recovery attempt. As long as BPCL holds above the Rs 355 support area, the near-term outlook remains steady. The stock is also respecting the rising VWAP (volume-weighted average price).\n\nBSE has maintained its post-September recovery and is currently trading within a well-defined range on the daily chart. After a sharp advance from the September lows, the stock has spent the last several weeks consolidating between the Rs 2,650 and Rs 2,950 zones, with prices now positioned in the upper half of this range.\n\nThe stock continues to trade above its 20-day average near Rs 2,750, indicating that short-term support remains intact. The daily RSI is placed near 60, reflecting steady momentum. The DMI setup shows the positive directional line above the negative line, while the ADX remains low. As long as the stock holds above Rs 2,750, the broader setup remains stable, with a directional move likely only on a decisive range breakout.\n\nHitesh Tailor, Technical Research Analyst at Choice Broking\n\nLarsen & Toubro| CMP: Rs 3,932.9\n\nLarsen & Toubro continues to exhibit a strong bullish structure in the longer-term trend. On the weekly chart, the stock is maintaining a clear higher high–higher low formation, confirming sustained trend strength. Recently, L&T delivered a breakout above its previous higher high. Post-breakout, the price retraced toward the 50-week EMA, where it found strong support and resumed its upward move, indicating healthy pullback buying and trend validation.\n\nThe stock is trading comfortably above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-week EMAs, reinforcing the presence of a robust primary uptrend and positive medium-to-long-term sentiment. On the downside, Rs 3,800 acts as an important support zone, where accumulation activity is visible. The latest weekly candle has engulfed the previous range, reflecting renewed bullish dominance and improving momentum.\n\nIndus Towers has recently delivered a decisive breakout from its prolonged sideways range, signalling the beginning of a fresh bullish phase. Post-breakout, the stock witnessed a healthy retest of the breakout zone, where it successfully took support aligned with the 50-day EMA and has since started moving higher, indicating strong follow-through buying and improving price structure.\n\nThe stock is trading above its key 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMAs, confirming a well-established uptrend and reinforcing positive short-to-medium-term sentiment. From the recent bottom, Indus Towers is forming a higher high and higher low structure, reflecting sustained demand and trend continuation. On the downside, Rs 425 remains an important support area, where accumulation activity is clearly visible.\n\nMomentum also supports the bullish view, with the RSI placed at 61.89, holding above the midline and turning higher, suggesting strengthening upside momentum.\n\nAxis Bank is showing clear signs of strength after registering a decisive breakout above its previous higher high. The breakout is supported by strong volumes, indicating genuine buying interest and improved participation, which enhances the reliability of the move and signals bullish intent.\n\nOn the weekly chart, the stock is trading comfortably above its key 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-week EMAs, confirming a well-established primary uptrend and strengthening medium-to-long-term sentiment. On the downside, the Rs 1,320–1,340 zone emerges as an important support area, aligned with the earlier higher-high breakout region, indicating a classic role reversal from resistance to support and providing a favourable risk-reward setup.\n\nMomentum indicators further support the bullish outlook, with the RSI placed at 69.36, reflecting a strong rising trend and sustained upside momentum without immediate signs of exhaustion.",

        "full_content": "India’s new consumer price index (CPI) series, set to be released on February 12, will mark a significant shift in how inflation is measured, with food losing prominence and rural India gaining a larger say in the overall index.\n\nAccording to the report of the expert group on revising the CPI base year, the weight of food and beverages in the headline index will decline sharply to 36.8 percent from 45.9 percent in the current 2012-based series. The change reflects evolving consumption patterns, with households spending a greater share on non-food items and services as incomes rise and urbanisation deepens.\n\nWhile food’s influence on headline inflation will reduce, the new series places a higher weight on rural India. The rural share in CPI is expected to rise to 55.4 percent, compared with 53.52 percent earlier. In contrast, the weight of urban India will fall to 44.6 percent from 46.48 percent. This rebalancing is based on updated consumption expenditure data and signals the continued importance of rural demand in shaping national inflation trends.\n\nA closer look at the expenditure groups shows that several non-food categories have gained weight in the new 2024 series. Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels now account for 17.7 percent of the index, up from 16.9 percent earlier. Health services have also seen a marginal increase to 6.1 percent from 5.9 percent, while transport and communication have edged up to 12.4 percent from 8.6 percent earlier.\n\nRestaurants and accommodation services account for 3.3 percent. Personal care, social protection and miscellaneous goods and services have been assigned a 5 percent share, reflecting the growing role of services in household spending.\n\nSome traditional categories, however, have lost ground. Clothing and footwear now account for 6.4 percent of the basket, slightly lower than 6.5 percent earlier, while education services have seen a sharper drop to 3.3 percent from 4.5 percent. Recreation, sport and culture also now carry a weight of 1.5 percent.\n\nOverall, the “miscellaneous” group—which largely captures non-food items and services—has expanded significantly, rising to 36.2 percent from 28.3 percent earlier. This structural shift is expected to make headline inflation less volatile over time, as the index becomes less sensitive to sharp swings in food prices, particularly vegetables.\n\nFor policymakers, the changes imply that future CPI readings may better reflect underlying demand conditions, even as rural price trends continue to play a dominant role in shaping India’s inflation trajectory.\n\nThe Economic Survey released on January 29 noted that inflation is likely to stay benign in the coming year, but core inflation still needed to be monitored.",

The rally brought Oracle’s valuation to more than $933 billion, making it the 10th most valuable publicly-listed US company at the time.\n\nThe swift decline in Oracle shares has been amplified by growing investor concern over AI as the biggest technology companies continue to pledge billions of dollars in capital expenditures to build out data centers, in some cases without a clear return on investment. Added to the mix are circular deals between OpenAI, a private company that’s not profitable, and companies such as Oracle and Nvidia. Oracle has also raised tens of billions of dollars of bonds recently through note sales in its name and indirectly through projects it’s backing.\n\n“There’s some assumptions built in here about what OpenAI is going to spend and where are they getting that money and, you know, is this really going to happen,” said Eric Diton, president and managing director of Wealth Alliance, an investment advisory firm. “Maybe Oracle stock got way ahead of fundamentals and now the market’s saying, alright, show me, I wanna see it.”\n\nOracle’s December earnings report kicked off the most recent leg lower, as the company said it ramped up spending on AI data centers, feeding concerns about how long it will take for the expenditures to pay off. A measure of Oracle’s credit risk jumped to its highest level since 2009 following the report.\n\nShares have also been weighed down by news that Blue Owl Capital, which has helped finance data center projects for Oracle and Meta Platforms Inc, is not included in final negotiations on an equity deal for a data center project in Michigan. Oracle said the negotiations are “on schedule.”\n\nIt’s also been caught up in a broader selloff in software stocks, which have seen valuations compressed as investor concern about disruption from AI mount.

        "full_content": "Copper surged by the most in more than 16 years, after a wave of buying from Chinese investors triggered one of the most dramatic moves in the market’s history.\n\nPrices gained as much as 11% to trade above $14,500 a ton for the first time ever, before a sharp retracement on Thursday afternoon as the dollar jumped.\n\nThe industrial metal, which is used in almost every electrical application, has risen about 21% since the start of December, firing up copper bulls who have long been predicting a surge in prices.\n\n“You wait a lifetime for markets like this,” said Mark Thompson, a mining executive and former trader at Trafigura Group with three decades of experience in the copper market. “We are one supply disruption away from $20,000.”\n\nChinese investors are piling into metals as they ride a powerful wave of momentum that has lifted everything from tin to silver to record highs. The initial surge in copper took place at a time of day when Chinese traders dominate flows, with prices on the London Metal Exchange rising more than 5% in less than an hour starting at 2.30 a.m. London time.\n\n“This is all driven by speculative funds,” said Yan Weijun, head of nonferrous metals research at Chinese trader Xiamen C&D Inc. “It’s likely all Chinese money given the surge is in Asian hours.”\n\nPrices rose more than $1,400 a ton before sliding by as much as $1,000 in less than an hour as US markets opened with a broad risk-off mood.\n\nCopper has long been a favorite of investors who see the energy transition and the growth of data centers driving demand. Still, the recent surge in prices has come in spite of indications of weak demand in China itself, which accounts for about half of physical consumption of the metal, and a widening contango on the LME, an indication of ample supplies.\n\nThe speculative frenzy has driven a surge in volumes on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, China’s top commodities trading platform. January was already the busiest month on record for the SHFE’s six base metals as of last week, and copper racked up its second-biggest daily trading volumes ever on Thursday.\n\nIt’s been an eye-watering few weeks for commodities, which have been aided by a sinking US dollar, rising demand for real, physical assets, and elevated geopolitical tensions as the Trump administration follows a more assertive foreign policy. Most recently, speculation that the next Federal Reserve chief will be more dovish than Jerome Powell has aided the rally.\n\n“Commodities are taking turns to rally,” said Eric Liu, deputy general manager of ASK Resources Co. “Copper has been hovering around $13,000 and funds have been brewing over the metal for some time.”\n\nCopper was up 3.1% at $13,495.00 a ton on the LME. Its intraday move was the biggest since 2009 — when China was rolling out massive stimulus measures in the aftermath of the great financial crisis. SHFE futures reached 114,000 yuan ($16,400) a ton as the exchange reopened for evening trading, following a 5.8% increase to 109,110 yuan at the close on Thursday. Other metals also rallied sharply in the morning before retreating in the afternoon, with aluminum down 1.5% and zinc up 2% in London.\n\nFed Chair Powell talked up a “clear improvement” in the US economic outlook as the bank kept borrowing costs on hold on Wednesday. His tenure ends in June, after which President Donald Trump may be better positioned to step up his campaign for lower rates.\n\n“Under the cycle in which the US maintains interest-rate cuts, the expectation for upward movement in copper prices has not changed,” said Chi Kai, chief investment officer at Shanghai Cosine Capital Management Partnership. “As for how high prices can rise, there is no clear expectation as long as the US continues to push AI, chips and power construction.”\n\nInvestors have been flocking in particular to metals needed in major growth markets. Tesla Inc.’s plan to spend $20 billion this year shifting resources to robotics and AI has underscored investment prospects. Copper, aluminum and tin would all be beneficiaries.\n\nBut the rally has been broad-based, with iron ore futures in Singapore gaining as much as 2.5%.\n\nThe advance in metals came after a gauge of the US currency sank to its lowest level in more than four years, with Trump signaling he was unconcerned by the weakness. That slide makes commodities more attractive for many buyers.\n\nThere are plenty of voices warning that the spectacular gains in metals have run ahead of real-world demand. There’s likely a “technical adjustment” coming as physical buyers in China balk at higher prices, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. co-head of China equities Trina Chen told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday.",

The S&P 500 Index fell 1.26%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.571%. An equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 Index traded down 0.318%.\n\n“Investors are selling because they probably realized they are not going to make as much money on the AI theme as they hoped for half a year ago,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. “The AI theme is overcrowded, and investors are revaluing the AI trade, so they are re-weighting big-tech stocks in their portfolios.”\n\nShares of Microsoft declined after the company reported record spending and slowing cloud sales growth on Thursday, fueling concerns that it could take longer than expected for the firm’s AI investments to pay off. Capital expenditures for the fiscal second quarter hit $37.5 billion, up 66% from a year earlier and exceeding analyst estimates for $36.2 billion.\n\nIts performance stands in sharp contrast to Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. The stock traded 7.74% higher on Thursday, with analysts saying its stronger-than-expected revenue outlook supports its massive capital spending for the next year.\n\n“The AI theme, and who benefits from the AI capex going forward, remains the largest driver of factor and market cap calls,” said Dennis DeBusschere, president and chief market strategist at 22V Research.\n\nInvestors will get another chance to assess the megacap technology space after markets close Thursday, when Apple Inc. is due to report results.\n\nIn Washington, US President Donald Trump and Democrat Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are reportedly nearing a deal to avert a government shutdown. Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank, said that with funding expiring this weekend, “the US is creeping too close for comfort” to a stoppage.\n\nOfficial data showed the US trade deficit widened in November from the lowest level since 2009 as imports rebounded and exports fell. The goods and services trade gap nearly doubled from the prior month to $56.8 billion, Commerce Department data showed Thursday. The 94.6% widening was the largest since 1992, while the shortfall for the month exceeded all projections in a Bloomberg survey of economists.\n\nSeparately, initial jobless claims for the last week came in ahead of expectations, while continuing claims fell. Dow Inc. shares fell after the company said Thursday it would cut roughly 4,500 jobs.",

        "full_content": "Brent crude futures topped $71 a barrel for the first time since August after US President Donald Trump warned Iran to make a nuclear deal or face military strikes.\n\nThe global oil benchmark rose as much as 5.1%, while US counterpart West Texas Intermediate topped $66 amid the renewed risk of conflict that could disrupt crude exports out of Iran or ripple effects across global markets if a critical shipping route is blocked.\n\nIn a social media post on Wednesday, Trump said that US ships he ordered to the region were ready to fulfill their mission “with speed and violence, if necessary.” The commodity rallied even higher after the Associated Press reported that Iran issued a warning to ships at sea that it planned to run a drill next week that would include live firing in the Strait of Hormuz, citing two Pakistani security officials and the EOS Risk Group.\n\nThe report stoked fears of a potential closure of the narrow passage that separates Iran and the Arabian peninsula, through which about a fifth of the world’s oil passes. Iran itself accounts for about 3% of global supply, producing roughly 3.3 million barrels per day.\n\nCrude has rallied so far in 2026, countering expectations for a market pressured by significant oversupply. Instead, geopolitical tensions from Iran to Venezuela and major supply disruption in Kazakhstan have helped to bolster prices.\n\nTrump’s latest threats have injected a risk premium into prices. Bullish call options have been more expensive than bearish puts for the longest stretch in about 14 months as traders seek to protect against the risk of a new confrontation between the US and Iran. Bullish option additions have also grown at the fastest pace in at least six years.\n\n“The potential for Iran getting hit has escalated the geopolitical premium of oil prices by potentially $3 to $4 a barrel,” Citigroup analysts including Anthony Yuen said in a note. “Oil prices can stay more elevated than many had expected, despite markets starting the year anticipating large oversupply.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly issued warnings on Iran, but those have most recently been linked to Tehran’s deadly crackdown on protests rather than its nuclear activities. The US president previously said the regime’s atomic program was “obliterated” in strikes in June that targeted three facilities.\n\nIn response, Iran has said it stands ready for dialogue but warned it would respond with unprecedented force if pushed. Tehran has stepped up diplomacy with key powers in the Middle East as it looks to head off more conflict with US.",

        "full_content": "Microsoft Corp. plunged the most in almost six years after reporting record spending and slowing cloud sales growth, fueling investor concerns that it could take longer than expected for the company’s AI investments to pay off.\n\nThe shares sank by as much as 11% to $429.24, for the biggest intraday slide since March 2020.\n\nCapital expenditures for the fiscal second quarter hit $37.5 billion, up 66% from a year earlier and exceeding analyst estimates for $36.2 billion.\n\nThe Azure cloud-computing unit posted a 38% revenue gain during the quarter when adjusting for currency fluctuations, just meeting analysts’ projections. That growth rate slowed — by a percentage point — from the prior quarter. The company expects Azure sales to rise 37% to 38% in the current quarter.\n\n“One of the core issues that is weighing on investors is cap ex is growing faster than we expected, and maybe Azure is growing a little bit slower than we expected,” Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said during an analysts’ call. Investors, he said, were concerned about the return on that spending.\n\nChief Financial Officer Amy Hood responded by saying that a chunk of cloud capacity is going toward internal teams, which boosts products such as Copilot. Had all of the new capacity gone toward Azure, the growth rates would have been notably higher, she said.\n\nThe world’s largest software maker has experienced rapid growth in its cloud computing business, thanks in part to a landmark partnership with leading artificial intelligence startup OpenAI. But despite spending heavily on data centers, Microsoft has struggled to get capacity online quickly enough to meet demand.\n\nMicrosoft has been rushing to bake AI tools, including those powered by OpenAI, into its products, betting that chatbots and automation technology will boost sales of the company’s productivity software and cloud services.\n\nDuring the analyst call, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said companies are now paying for 15 million subscriptions to the M365 Copilot, Microsoft’s main AI tool for office workers. Adoption is growing among the company’s enormous base of corporate users, Nadella said.\n\nTotal sales increased 17% to $81.3 billion during the quarter, while profit was $5.16 a share, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. The net income figure was boosted by gains from Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI, which lifted per-share earnings by $1.02.\n\nAnalysts had expected sales of $80.3 billion and per-share earnings of $3.92.\n\nThe value of commitments from customers that Microsoft expects to materialize as sales in future years more than doubled from a year earlier, primarily the result of a new, $250 billion deal with OpenAI. The startup accounted for 45% of Microsoft’s backlog, which stood at $625 billion at the end of December.\n\nMicrosoft is the first of the Big Three cloud services companies to report quarterly financial results this year. Alphabet Inc. is scheduled to release its earnings on Feb. 4, Amazon.com Inc. the following day.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta Platforms Inc. got a more positive investor reception after saying it’s spending more than anticipated to build out its AI business. As part of its quarterly earnings report Wednesday, Meta, the owner of Facebook, said full-year capital expenditures will be $115 billion to $135 billion, exceeding the $110.6 billion average analyst estimate — and the shares jumped about 7% in extended trading.",

While, in the months when food inflation is higher, the new CPI will be lower by 20–30 bps,” the report noted.\n\nA key change in the new CPI series is a sharp reduction in the weight of food and beverages to 36.75 percent from 45.86 percent in the current 2012-based series.\n\nThe combined weight of transport, information and communication, for instance, rises to 12.41 percent from 8.59 percent, while recreation and culture nearly triples to 4.86 percent.\n\nThe new CPI (2024=100) will include 358 weighted items, up from 299 earlier, and adopt the latest COICOP 2018 classification to improve global comparability.

        "full_content": "Big Tech earnings so far this week have sent a clear warning: investors are willing to overlook soaring spending on artificial intelligence if it fuels strong growth, but are quick to punish companies that fall short.\n\nThe contrast was clear in Thursday's stock market reaction to earnings from Microsoft and Meta, highlighting how dramatically the stakes have changed since the launch of ChatGPT started the AI boom more than three years ago.\n\nShares of the Instagram parent surged more than 9% on strong sales, while those of Microsoft slumped 10% after its cloud business failed to impress.\n\nAfter riding its first-mover advantage with OpenAI to become the world's most valuable firm in 2024, Microsoft is now under growing investor pressure to justify its soaring capital outlay.\n\nMicrosoft reported revenue growth in its Azure cloud-computing business that was only slightly above expectations.\n\nIn contrast, AI bolstered ad targeting at Meta, boosting revenue by 24% in the December quarter and aiding a rosy first-quarter forecast. The results show that the Facebook owner's gains from AI were helping fund its capital spending, which is expected to jump as much as 87% to $135 billion this year.\n\n\"Meta's headline numbers are a really interesting reflection of the market's attitude toward spending in the AI space,\" said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.\n\n\"All else equal, the market would typically be concerned, but they have a big revenue guide for the first quarter.\"\n\nMICROSOFT MIGHT HAVE AN OPENAI PROBLEM\n\nMicrosoft also faced pressure after a disclosure that OpenAI, its prized holding, accounts for 45% of its cloud backlog. Investors are worried that some $280 billion could be at risk as the unprofitable startup loses momentum in the AI race.\n\nThe ChatGPT creator had issued an internal \"code-red\" in December after Google's Gemini 3 launched to positive reviews and is playing catch-up in AI coding to Anthropic's Claude Code, which has hit an annualised run rate of more than $1 billion.\n\n\"Microsoft's deep ties to OpenAI underpin its leadership in enterprise AI, but they also introduce concentration risk,\" said Zavier Wong, market analyst at eToro.\n\nMicrosoft predicted Azure growth to stay stable in the period from January to March at 37% to 38%, after slowing in the last three months of 2025, partially due to AI chip capacity constraints.\n\n\"If I had taken the graphics processing units that just came online in the first quarter and second quarter, and allocated them all to Azure, the KPI (growth) would have been over 40%,\" Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood said on a post-earnings call.\n\nShe added that the use of chips for internal development efforts had limited the growth.\n\nMETA BETS ON AI'S COMPOUNDING EFFECT\n\nFor Meta, the revenue growth underscored that its AI pivot was paying off and helping the company catch up to early leaders.\n\nIts revenue rose 24% in the fourth quarter and Meta forecast growth to accelerate as much as 33% in the current quarter.\n\nThe company is racking up bills at large cloud providers, such as Alphabet's Google, which bodes well for the search giant's results next week. Alphabet shares rose 1.6%.\n\nUsing AI \"will both improve the quality of the organic experience and of advertising,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said.\n\n\"I think that will have a compounding effect,\" he added, as Meta predicted a jump of 43% in total expenses this year to $169 billion.\n\nTESLA SET TO DOUBLE OUTLAY THIS YEAR\n\nGrowing spending was also the theme at Elon Musk's Tesla, which will double outlay this year to more than $20 billion as it pivots to AI, humanoid robots and personal vehicles that can drive themselves.\n\nThe company also reported quarterly profit and revenue that were above expectations, pushing its shares up 2.9%.\n\nAnalysts said the results left some mismatch between corporate AI goals and investors' demand for payoffs.\n\n\"The market appears to be questioning whether these massive capital expenditure hikes will generate sufficient returns,\" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.\n\n\"This reflects a growing divide between tech companies' AI ambitions and Wall Street's patience for open-ended investment cycles.\"",

        "full_content": "India’s quick commerce market is going through a phase of sustained competitive intensity that is distorting growth outcomes, according to Amitesh Jha, chief executive of Instamart.\n\nSpeaking during Swiggy’s Q3FY26 earnings call, Jha said “irrationality” in the market has emerged as a key headwind for growth and is already impacting listed players. He added that Swiggy expects this environment to persist as new entrants continue to spend aggressively on customer acquisition.\n\n“Growth has many reasons for not happening, primarily due to the irrationality in the market, which has impacted both listed players,” Jha said, adding that the company believes such competitive behaviour will continue to weigh on growth in the near term.\n\n‘Good growth’ versus growth bought through discounts\n\nJha was unequivocal in drawing a line between what Swiggy considers healthy growth and growth driven by aggressive discounting.\n\n“We are not going to throw good money at bad growth,” he said, stressing that the company is unwilling to compromise margins in pursuit of headline numbers. While Swiggy could show higher order volumes by deploying more capital, Jha said such growth would not translate into sustainable leadership.\n\n“If our ambition is real market leadership, it is never going to happen by spending tons of good money on essentially buying growth,” he said.\n\nAccording to Jha, discount-heavy strategies are creating behaviour where customers move rapidly between platforms with little loyalty, weakening long-term unit economics.\n\nThat stance was echoed in the company’s shareholder letter, where Sriharsha Majety, group chief executive officer, said recent efforts to lower consumer-side monetisation had failed to deliver meaningful returns.\n\n“Our recent investments into lower consumer-side monetization have not yielded the desired incremental order-growth, especially at the bottom of the AOV-pyramid; and are being reviewed,” Majety said. “We have consciously chosen not to participate in deep-discount-driven, purely-volume-focussed growth that sacrifices AOVs and margins.”\n\nOrder growth without basket expansion a red flag\n\nJha also flagged a structural issue emerging from the current phase of competition: rising order volumes are not being accompanied by stronger consumer engagement.\n\n“Whenever we have seen order growth for any of these platforms, the basket size has not increased. In fact, they have decreased,” he said, arguing that this indicates growth that is neither healthy nor sustainable.\n\nSwiggy, he added, has consciously chosen not to compete in areas where growth is driven primarily by such metrics, even if it means foregoing short-term gains. “We can do more numbers to show higher OPD (orders per day) by putting more money into growth, but we don’t believe that is the right structural growth,” Jha said.\n\nFocus on retention, not discount-seeking users\n\nAs competitive intensity has picked up since October, Jha said Swiggy expects elevated spending by new entrants to continue. However, he expressed confidence that the market will eventually correct as platforms focus more on retention than acquisition.\n\n“New entrants are going after the metric of orders, not on the orders that ultimately matter to end consumers,” he said, adding that retention will ultimately depend on the strength of the core value proposition.\n\nJha said Swiggy is comfortable losing discount-seeking customers in the short term, arguing that long-term loyalty in quick commerce will be driven by assortment depth, availability and speed rather than sustained incentives.\n\n“Investing good money into bad ways to make customers mature is not a priority,” he said, adding that customers acquired primarily through discounts tend to leave once incentives are withdrawn.",

The rally was driven by strong demand for safe-haven assets, strong inflows into ETFs, and a weak US dollar,\" Saumil Gandhi, Senior Analyst, Commodities at HDFC Securities told PTI.\n\nHe noted that ongoing geopolitical tensions and global economic uncertainty have reinforced gold and silver's role as preferred hedges against risk, prompting investors to increase allocations to precious metals.\n\nMeanwhile, India's gold demand declined 11 pc in 2025 and is expected to be around 700 tonne this year, weighed down by record-high prices and changing consumer buying patterns, the World Gold Council (WGC) said in a report on Thursday.\n\nOverall gold demand in India fell 11 per cent to 710.9 tonnes in 2025 and is expected to be between 600 and 700 tonnes in 2026, according to the WGC's Full-Year 2025 Gold Demand Trends report.\n\nIn 2024, the overall gold demand stood at 802.8 tonnes.\n\nHowever, in value terms, skyrocketing prices boosted demand by 30 per cent to Rs 7,51,490 crore, compared to Rs 5,75,930 crore in the previous year.\n\n\"India's gold market in Q4 2025 clearly reflected the dual impact of record-high prices and shifting consumer behaviour. Total gold demand for the quarter stood at 241.3 tonne, marking a 9 per cent decline compared to Q4 2024.\n\n\"However, this moderation in volume was more than offset by a sharp rise in value, with overall gold demand increasing 49 per cent year-on-year to approx. Rs 3,03,470 crore,\" WGC Regional CEO, India, Sachin Jain, told PTI.\n\nIn the international market, gold increased USD 177.14, or 3.3 per cent, to touch a fresh peak of USD 5,595.02 per ounce.\n\n\"Spot gold posted its largest-ever intraday gain to hit a fresh record high of USD 5,595, driven by heightened geopolitical tensions after the US President Donald Trump threatened Iran with dire consequences to return to talks to reach a new deal on its nuclear programme,\" Praveen Singh, Research Analyst, Mirae Asset Sharekhan, said.\n\nThe yellow metal prices were also boosted after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that Trump could make an announcement \"in the next week or so\" about who he will pick to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve.\n\nSpot silver advanced sharply, rising USD 3.59, or 3.07 per cent, to hit a lifetime high of USD 120.45 per ounce in overseas trade.\n\nSandip Raichura, CEO of Retail Broking and Distribution & Director, PL Capital, said, \"Gold price movements based on the past may no longer work as we believe the world is witnessing a once in a century phenomenon and therefore gold could head much higher in the next two years, possibly crossing USD 8,000 by 2027.\" According to WGC, global demand for gold has crossed 5,000 tonnes to reach a new all-time high in 2025, mainly driven by investments.\n\nTotal gold demand hit a new all-time high of 5,002 tonnes in 2025, up from 4,961.9 tonne in the previous year, as the investment demand surged to 2,175.3 tonne compared to 1,185.4 tonne in 2024, driven by safe-haven and diversification factors, WGC said.",

We are looking for partners for offloading of shares. We hope to come out with an expression of interest calling interested parties shortly, though we have time till 2030, which is the asset monetisation deadline set by the government,” Arunangshu Sarkar, director—strategy & corporate affairs, ONGC, said on the sidelines of the India Energy Week.\n\nONGC owns 95.69% stake in OPaL while GAIL (India) Limited holds 4.19% stake and Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) another 0.12%. OPaL has a petrochemical complex in Dahej in Gujarat and has a capacity to produce 1.5 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) of polymers and 0.5 mmtpa of chemicals.\n\nIn 2025, OPaL received the final approval for its exit from the Dahej Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and operate as a Domestic Tariff Area (DTA) unit in order to cater to the domestic market.\n\nRecognizing its long-term potential and to address OPaL’s financial challenges, ONGC undertook a capital restructuring of Rs 18,365 crore and exited from SEZ area.\n\nIn parallel, to ensure feedstock stability and reduce reliance on volatile LNG markets, the government had approved allocation of up to 3.2 MMSCM/day of gas from new wells. “These interventions are poised to significantly enhance OPaL’s operational performance and sustainability, positioning it as a value-accretive asset in ONGC’s integrated energy portfolio,” the company had said in its annual report FY25.\n\nThe company sold 1785 KT of petchem products during FY25 against 1769 KT during FY24, while its revenue from operations stood at Rs 14,804 crore during FY25 compared to Rs 14,307 crore during FY24, as per ONGC’s annual report for 2024-25.\n\nThe director said that the upstream major has further planned to develop 50-55 MW (megawatt) of small modular reactors for its own captive use.\n\n“Already we have done EoI (Expression of Interest) and all. We have received a lot of interest. We are planning for 50-55 MW of SMRs that will be used as captive power in our own plants,” Sarkar said.\n\nWhen asked about the company’s plans in LNG sourcing, Sarkar said that the company is targeting both term and spot purchases of gas.\n\nThe company through its joint venture with Japan’s Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd (MOL), has recently signed Ship Building Contracts (SBCs) with Samsung Heavy Industries, South Korea, for the construction of two Very Large Ethane Carriers (VLECs).\n\nSpeaking on the development, Sarkar said that the agreement will ensure regular supply of ethane after Qatar stops supplying rich gas (ethane and propane) starting 2028.\n\nThe capacity of each carrier is expected to be 50 kilo tonnes and will be developed by 2028, Sarkar said. The vessels are expected to transport about 600 KTPA of ethane for OPaL.",

Most of the approvals have been secured barring a couple of countries,” Ramanan said.\n\nIn July 2025, Tata Motors, through its commercial vehicle business, announced the acquisition of Iveco Group, the world’s fifth-largest commercial vehicle manufacturer. The transaction marked the company’s biggest overseas deal to date.\n\n“We expect all the approvals to be in place by around mid-March, which was the earlier timeline that we were talking about. Our earlier timeline of completing the acquisition was Q1 FY27, and that is on track,” Ramanan added.\n\nThe company also said the separation of Iveco’s defence business—excluded from the Tata Motors deal—is progressing as scheduled. “From the Iveco side, this has been confirmed very clearly, that the committed timeline will be met,” Ramanan said.\n\nIveco informed shareholders on January 23, 2026, that an Extraordinary General Meeting to authorise the distribution of the net proceeds from the sale of its defence business to Leonardo S.p.A. is expected to be held in the second half of March 2026.\n\nThe company had earlier stated in July 2025 that if the sale to Leonardo is not completed on or before March 31, 2026, it would initiate steps to spin off the defence business through a statutory demerger. Under that plan, the defence unit would be transferred to a newly incorporated entity under Dutch law.",

Inflated premium, inadequate cover and investment 'returns' that an FD would outperform. At ACKO Life, we made the hard choice of not mixing life insurance,” Acko founder Varun Dua said in a LinkedIn post.\n\nSuch quasi-investment products dilute the original life insurance purpose, while as an investment product, it does not deliver good returns as well, the company said.\n\nDua added that such practices dilute protection with 50 other 'benefits' and add confusion for end-consumers.\n\n“The move positions Acko as an ‘Unmixed’ insurer, prioritising high-value, low-cost life cover as a direct counter to the systemic issues plaguing the Indian insurance sector,” the company said.\n\nAcko’s announcement comes amidst the new insurance bill, which has flagged mis-selling as one of the key issues plaguing the industry. According to recent IRDAI data a 14.3% year-on-year surge in grievances related to Unfair Business Practices (UFBP), or mis-selling.\n\nWhile total life insurance premiums have grown to nearly $100 billion, national insurance penetration has declined to around 2.7 percent of the country’s GDP.\n\nHowever, the high premium masks the widening Mortality Protection Gap—the financial shortfall families face upon the death of a primary earner. This gap has surged 35% since 2017, according to data from a report by the Swiss Re Institute. India’s underpenetration meant that the gap is much wider in the country in practice.\n\nAcko said that by focussing on pure term life insurance, the company is looking to make insurance affordable and transparent. It said that this could help the Bengaluru-based company to drive up the penetration, apart from increasing consumer trust in the sector.",

        "full_content": "India’s Economic Survey aims to deliver a comprehensive, data-driven assessment of the economy's performance.Its significance lies in serving as a policy blueprint that flags key challenges and reform priorities to inform Budget decisions and signal government thinking to investors.\n\nAs expected, external challenges occupy considerable space in the latest Economic Survey—understandably so, amid escalating geopolitical tensions, no respite from Trump tariffs, and a weakening rupee (down 6.5% since April 2025) amid volatile capital flows that are roiling the country’s stock market.\n\nThe other major concerns highlighted by the Survey include the high cost of capital, underperformance of manufacturing and its limited integration with global value chains (GVCs), state-level fiscal populism, unbalanced use of agricultural inputs and low farm productivity, urban governance and stressed urban infrastructure, along with issues related to unemployment and public health.\n\nThe Survey argues that the world is shifting toward a phase of“managed disorder,”where trade policy is increasingly shaped by “security considerations” rather than “cost efficiency.” Coercive trade measures are replacing commitment to multilateral trade rules, leading to a realignment of supply chains. In India’s case,services trade surpluses and remittances are insufficientto offset large merchandise trade deficits. As a result, India depends on foreign capital inflows to maintain a healthy balance of payments, and any disruption in capital flows affects rupee stability and investor confidence.\n\nIt further argues that India’s high cost of capital is a structural outcome of persistent current account deficits and dependence on foreign savings. Reducing this cost durably requires transforming India into a“surplus-generating economy” through export-led growth and deeper integration with production networks.While services have been the mainstay, they are not a substitute for a robust “goods-based export ecosystem”. India needs to move from mere “strategic resilience” to“strategic indispensability”by becoming an essential, non-substitutable node in global value chains.\n\nWhat can be expected in the Union Budget\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the following can be expected from the upcoming Union Budget on Sunday:\n\n# The Budget is likely to emphasise the importance of free trade agreements (FTAs) in boosting exports andreiterate its commitment to expediting pending trade deals,especially the one with the US. To support manufacturing competitiveness and goods exports, further rationalisation of import duties is expected to address what is called the inverted duty structure—higher duties on raw materials and intermediates and lower duties on finished goods.Lowering duties on key industrial inputs, such as textile fibres, is expected to reduce production costs for downstream industries.Further withdrawal or rationalisation of Quality Control Orders (QCOs)that make it difficult to source inputs may also be announced.\n\n# We can also expect expansion of the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to more industries to boost exports and support job creation. As the Survey argues that the key to rupee stability lies in exports, the Budget is likely to considerexpanding and strengthening export promotion missions, along with increased export incentives for labour-intensive industries badly affected by Trump’s tariffs. Export facilitation measures, including further rationalisation of customs rules and regulations, can be expected.\n\n# Rising revenue deficits and unconditional cash transfers by states pose risks by “crowding out growth-enhancing capital expenditure”. This fiscal indiscipline at the state level increasingly affects the cost of sovereign borrowing. Therefore, Budget 2026 may further strengthen theSpecial Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI)framework, perhaps by introducing stricter performance-linked conditionalities that reward states for reducing revenue deficits while maintaining capital expenditure.\n\n# Proposals to deepen the corporate bond market—reducing reliance on bank-led debt and lowering the cost of capital for firms—are expected to boost private capex. Some announcements to assure foreign investors on tax certainty are also likely. However, given fiscal constraints, the government is unlikely to reduce or remove long-term capital gains tax that may not be liked by the country’s financial markets.\n\n# Indian crop yields continue to trail global averages due to technological and climatic constraints, as highlighted by the Survey. A major challenge is the distortedN:P:K fertiliser ratio,driven by excessive urea use, which is degrading soil health and lowering productivity. To restore soil health and boost farm output, the Budget may consider aphased re-engineering of the fertiliser subsidy programme.\n\nTaken together, the Economic Survey sets out a clear diagnosis of India’s structural constraints and the reform direction needed to sustain growth in an increasingly fragmented global economy. Budget 2026 is therefore likely to prioritise export competitiveness, lower the cost of capital, reinforce fiscal discipline, and address long-standing productivity challenges across manufacturing and agriculture. The credibility of the Budget will ultimately rest on whether it can translate the Survey’s strategic intent into concrete, implementable policy actions.\n\n(Ritesh Kumar Singh is a business economist and CEO, Indonomics Consulting Private Limited.

Reduction in interest rates & liquidity support by RBI, lower inflation, income tax cuts along with front loading of government expenditure, reduction in GST rates across a wide range of products and the India-EU Free Trade agreement augur well for economic growth, ITC said in a statement.\n\nStandalone cigarette business’ revenue rose 8 percent year-on-year to Rs 8,791 crore in the December quarter.\n\nCommenting on the revised duties on cigarettes, the company said, \"The changes in GST and excise duty rates announced recently, have led to an unprecedented increase in tax incidence on cigarettes. Such a steep increase will provide further impetus to illicit trade and cause immense hardship and loss to millions of farmers, MSMEs, retailers, local value chains nurtured by the industry and the Exchequer.\"\n\nStarting February 1, government is implementing a major overhaul of cigarette taxation, wherein existing GST compensation cess will be replaced by a new additional excise duty alongside a hike in the standard GST rate to 40 percent.\n\nITC said that the legal cigarette industry continues to engage with policymakers for a framework of pragmatic, equitable, non-discriminatory, evidence-based regulations and taxation policies that balance the economic imperatives of the country and tobacco control objectives, cognising for the unique tobacco consumption pattern in India.\n\nThe company added that it will the cigarettes business will continue to invest in its powerful trademarks & well-laddered product portfolio, innovation capacity, manufacturing excellence, integrated seed-to-smoke value chain, and world-class last mile execution capability to reinforce its market standing\n\nMeanwhile, the FMCG-others business, which owns brands such as Aashirvaad, Sunfeast and Fiama, reported revenue of Rs 6,020 crore, up 11.1 percent year-on-year on a standalone basis bed by growth in staples, biscuits, noodles, dairy, premium personal wash, homecare & agarbattis. ITC flagged strong performance in  premium portfolio and NewGen channels, while digital-first & organic portfolio record 60 percent YoY growth in the quarter.\n\nRevenue from the agri business increased 6.3 percent year-on-year to Rs 3,560 crore, led by value added agri products & leaf tobacco.\n\nRevenue from the paperboards, paper and packaging business rose 2.7 percent to Rs 2,202 crore. However, overall Industry remains impacted by low-priced supplies, high wood prices & subdued realisations, ITC said.",

        "full_content": "Tesla Inc. will spend over $20 billion on a dramatic reshuffling of factory lines reflecting Elon Musk’s repositioning of the carmaker coming off a multiyear sales slump.\n\nThe capital expenditures planned for 2026 — more than double last year’s outlay and almost twice as much as Wall Street was expecting — will go to ramping up production of cars, batteries and robots across half a dozen plants. To make room for new Optimus humanoids, Tesla will discontinue its two oldest vehicles, the Model S sedan and Model X SUV.\n\n“We’re making very, very big investments,” Musk said on a call after Tesla released better-than-expected quarterly results. Tesla shares rose more than 3% as of 5:35 a.m. Thursday in New York, before the start of regular trading.\n\nTesla also announced a surprise agreement to invest about $2 billion into Musk’s money-losing artificial intelligence startup, xAI, and signaled it’s likely to build a semiconductor manufacturing facility. The moves underscore Tesla’s ambitions to reorient around AI, driverless technology and robots at the expense of its car business, which faces more challenges in 2026 after consecutive annual sales declines.\n\nInvestors have broadly supported the reinvention, even as the new business lines either remain far off or uncertain to succeed. Neither the broader auto industry’s EV winter nor Tesla’s earnings beat garnered much attention on Wednesday’s call.\n\n“This quarter officially marks the fundamental shift from EV company to an all-in bet on robotaxi, energy and Optimus,” said Andrew Rocco, an analyst with Zacks Investment Research. “It looks like they’re almost ready to tear off the Band-Aid on the EV business and go full in on autonomy.”\n\nTesla agreed this month to acquire preferred shares in xAI as part of the closely held company’s latest funding round. The companies also entered into a “framework” accord to strengthen their relationship and “enhance Tesla’s ability to develop and deploy AI products and services into the physical world,” the company said in its earnings release.\n\nThe investment highlights the deepening ties between Musk’s business interests and reinforces the growing focus on AI.\n\nThe xAI agreement will likely be welcomed by many investors and overshadow the earnings results, said Matt Maley, chief market strategist for Miller Tabak + Co.\n\n“If Tesla is going to do as well as the bulls are thinking, it’s going to be with the robotaxi and robotics,” Maley said. “So, this investment is exactly what the bulls wanted to hear.”\n\nWhile Musk has previously voiced support for Tesla investing in xAI, the move follows an unsuccessful shareholder vote on the prospect in November. While more of Tesla’s shareholders voted for a nonbinding measure encouraging an investment, a significant number of abstentions meant the measure didn’t pass. Still, Tesla said then that it would continue to explore the possibility.\n\nThe two companies already work together. Tesla has sold Megapack energy storage systems to xAI, and xAI’s Grok chatbot is integrated into some Tesla vehicles. Bloomberg reported earlier this month that xAI told investors its aims to build AI will eventually power humanoid robots such as Optimus.\n\nTesla’s adjusted earnings dropped to 50 cents a share in the quarter, exceeding analysts’ average estimate. The company snapped a streak of four quarters in which profit on that basis was weaker than expected.\n\nMusk has previously warned Tesla was headed for a rough patch navigating lower EV demand and waning US subsidies. While the company is finally bringing its long-planned Semi truck to market this year and will soon start making its two-door, two seat Cybercab, production of the Model S and X will wind down in the next quarter. The S, which costs about $95,000, and the X, with a price tag of nearly $100,000, are much lower-volume vehicles compared with Tesla’s more affordable 3 and Y models.\n\nThe profit beat helps offset disappointment stemming from a steady decline in vehicle sales. Tesla earlier this month reported a 9% decline in 2025 deliveries. The company ended the year with a 16% quarterly vehicle sales drop, its steepest decline yet.\n\nAn increasingly crowded EV market, the end of US tax credits for EV purchases and a backlash against Musk’s polarizing politics and his role in the Trump administration contributed to the company’s woes.\n\nOne of the company’s lucrative revenue streams — selling regulatory compliance credits to other carmakers — also is coming under pressure, with sales falling 22% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. That income has dropped since the US eliminated penalties for automakers exceeding fuel-economy standards.\n\nDue to the regulatory credit revenue slide and drop in vehicle deliveries, Tesla’s annual revenue declined for the first time.\n\nThe company reported for the first time that it has 1.1 million active subscribers for its Full Self-Driving system, the suite of assistance features that drivers need to constantly supervise. Musk announced recently that FSD will transition to a subscription-only model starting next month.\n\nTesla said it aims to deploy robotaxis in Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Orlando, Tampa and Las Vegas in the first half of this year. The only city where the company has offered rides without safety drivers is Austin, and the business fell well short of Musk’s predictions for expansion last year.\n\nThe company also operates a ride-share service via the same app in the San Francisco Bay area with safety drivers behind the wheel. It’s already secured permits for testing in Nevada and Arizona.",

We have sharpened our competitive edge through stronger innovation and focused brand building, leading to healthy market share gains. As demand conditions improve, the combination of favourable macroeconomic indicators and expectations of supportive policy measures, reinforced by recent GST changes, positions us well for the quarters ahead, and we remain confident of delivering sustainable growth, resilient profitability, and continued shareholder value,\" said Malhotra.\n\nConsumer demand has been gradually improving in India, multiple consumer firms have said, as a sustained moderation in inflation and the government's income tax cuts increase appetite for spending.\n\nDabur's consolidated net profit rose 7% to Rs 560 crore for the quarter ended December 31. Analysts had expected, on average, Rs 556 crore, as per LSEG data.\n\nTotal revenue grew 6% to Rs 3,559 crore.\n\nThe company took a one-time hit of 150.5 million rupees due to the implementation of India's new labour codes, the biggest overhaul of workers' laws in decades.\n\nOn January 29, Dabur India shares closed 1% lower at Rs 510 apiece.

        "full_content": "For many Indians, owning a house is still one of life’s biggest financial goals. Earlier, people often waited until retirement to build a home using their savings. Today, easier access to home loans means many people start construction much earlier, even while they’re still building their careers.\n\nIf you’re planning to construct a house on your own plot, it’s important to know how homeloansfor self-construction work, when EMIs begin, and how tax benefits really apply.\n\nCan you get a home loan for building a house?\n\nYes, but with a few differences.\n\nBanks and housing finance companies generally treat loans for ready-to-move homes and under-construction flats similarly when it comes to interest rates, tenure and broad eligibility. The key difference is in how the money is released.\n\nFor self-construction on your own land, fewer lenders are willing to finance the project. Those that do usually offer either a construction loan or a composite loan that covers both the plot and the construction cost.\n\nIn such cases, the lender does not hand over the full loan amount upfront. You are expected to first put in your share of the money. The loan is then disbursed in stages, linked to the progress of construction.\n\nHow disbursements actually happen\n\nMoney is released in tranches as construction moves ahead. To trigger each disbursement, you typically need to submit certificates from your architect or civil engineer confirming the stage of construction. Photographs of the site are also commonly required.\n\nSome lenders go a step further and send their own engineer to verify progress instead of relying only on your documents. This can slow things down slightly, but it’s standard practice.\n\nThe important thing to remember is that cash flow planning matters. You need enough funds to keep construction moving between disbursements.\n\nMany borrowers assume EMIs begin only after construction is fully completed. That’s not always true.\n\nWhile regular EMIs usually start once the entire loan has been disbursed, you may still have to pay interest on the amount already released during the construction phase. This is known as pre-EMI interest.\n\nPre-EMI payments are interest-only and do not reduce the principal. They can stretch for months or even years, depending on how long construction takes.\n\nWhat tax benefits can you claim?\n\nTax benefits for a self-construction home loan depend heavily on timing and the tax regime you choose.\n\nUnder Section 80C, you can claim up to Rs 1.5 lakh a year for principal repayment, along with other eligible investments. However, principal repayments made before the construction is completed do not qualify for this deduction.\n\nThere’s another catch. If you sell the house within five years from the end of the financial year in which you take possession, all the principal-related deductions you claimed earlier are reversed and added back to your income in the year of sale. This benefit is available only under the old tax regime.\n\nWhat about interest deductions?\n\nInterest on a home loan is treated more generously.\n\nYou can claim interest under Section 24(b) only after the construction is completed and you take possession of the house. But the interest you paid during the construction phase is not lost. It can be claimed in five equal instalments, starting from the year the house is completed, along with the regular interest for that year.\n\nFor self-occupied houses, the maximum interest deduction is Rs 2 lakh a year under the old tax regime. If construction is not completed within five years from the end of the year in which the loan was taken, this limit drops sharply to Rs 30,000.\n\nIf the property is let out, you can claim the full interest amount, although losses that can be set off against other income are capped at Rs 2 lakh a year.\n\nUnder the new tax regime, interest deduction is not available for self-occupied houses, and losses from house property cannot be adjusted against other income.\n\nOne small but important relief\n\nUnlike principal repayment benefits, interest deductions claimed under Section 24(b) are not reversed if you sell the house within five years of completion. That distinction often gets overlooked.\n\nBuilding your own house with a home loan can work well, but it requires careful planning. Disbursements are staggered, EMIs don’t always wait for completion, and tax benefits depend heavily on timelines and the tax regime you choose.\n\nBefore you begin construction, it helps to map out not just the cost of the house, but also how cash will flow during the build and when tax benefits will actually kick in. A little clarity upfront can prevent a lot of confusion later.",

        "full_content": "As the Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran had indicated in an opinion piece ahead of the Economic Survey, geopolitics and global uncertainty emerged as defining themes of the report. While these forces pose clear risks to India,the Survey underscored the imperative of strengthening domestic fundamentals to cushion against external shocks—recognising that the global environment may yet deteriorate. As the proverb goes,a house built on strong foundations can withstand any storm.\n\nThe first job was to ascertain how big the problem might get. To this end, the survey outlines three scenarios of various risk intensities. The ‘best-case’ scenario of a ‘managed disorder’, which was allocated 40-45% probability, final stress episodes, trade frictions and geopolitics introduce volatility and government intervention but do not trigger a systemic collapse.\n\nAlmost similar probability was allocated to the second scenario, which involved a disorderly multipolar breakdown, where geopolitical tensions intensify and countries face trade-offs between stability, growth and autonomy.\n\nA third and severe scenario, which received a 10-20% probability outlined a 2008 GFC-like effect, with broader risk-aversion with financial market as well as real economy implications.\n\nIndispensability through manufacturing\n\nBeyond the stage-setting, the survey portrayed inherent optimism on the Indian economy’s ability to fight these risks. While a lot of arguments were presented, there was a strong case for a single-minded focus on expanding manufacturing capabilities. Interestingly, manufacturing was framed as a \"disciplining system\" that would force improvements in logistics, power, and regulation because production failures in this sector are immediately and externally visible.\n\nThe emphasis was also on the economy finding its key bargaining chip, which will contribute to its “strategic indispensability”, i.e., integrate the Indian economy so deeply into global networks that others are invested in its continued functioning. This requires moving beyond assembly to high-tech manufacturing, as seen in the India Semiconductor Mission, which aims to secure domestic capacity in the \"heart\" of modern technology.\n\nThere were also suggestions on finetuning the AI adoption strategy to domestic realities. Instead of focusing on expansion of heavy compute infra which will not only add to the debt stock, but also strain existing resources, the preferred route would be to undertake a bottom-up AI strategy focused on application-specific, small models that are computationally efficient and tailored to local needs in health, agriculture, and education.\n\nState capacity and economic growth\n\nIn midst of these myriad changes, the survey does not lose sight of the importance of building the depth and quality of state capacity, particularly about the state’s ability to execute plans through administrative judgment and technical competence. After all, this was one of the reasons why aggressive increase in allocations towards capex spending, especially infrastructure, is ill-advised before strengthening capacity. In this context, the Survey identifies bureaucratic risk aversion as a significant hurdle, where good-faith decisions are often subjected to retrospective scrutiny, leading to policy inertia. To counter this, it advocates for the \"Entrepreneurial State\"—one that acts under uncertainty, learns from systematic experimentation, and corrects course without paralysis. It goes to provide the required reforms to enhance state capacity.\n\nIn all, the Economic Survey pegged FY27 GDP growth at 6.8% to 7.2%, slightly higher than street estimates, from a projected 7.4% in FY26. The FY27 Budget might undertake smaller steps to achieve few of the objectives outlined in the survey. Along with strong growth, the authorities will be keen to build and assert their strategic influence over time, with an immediate need to strengthen shock absorption mechanisms. An undervalued rupee for one does not seem to be raising the hackles for the time being.\n\n(Views are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.)",

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey's headlines are unabashedly positive, reiterating India's status as the world's fastest-growing major economy. GDP growth for the current fiscal year is 7.4%, though it is projected to moderate to between 6.8% and 7.2% over the next two fiscal years; the lower end of this range aligns with the IMF's estimates.\n\nSignificantly, the Survey reckons that potential growth has risen to 7% from current levels of 6.5%. Given current economic trajectories, this should translate into per capita income growth of over 5%. Furthermore, inflation is described as \"tamed and anchored,\" which may pave the way for interest rate cuts.\n\nIt hails the resilience of the Indian economy post the imposition of the ‘penal’ tariff of 25 percent by President Trump, raising the total 50%. It hails the slew of structural reforms, including the cut in GST and the implementation of the new labour codes. ”A sense of dynamism has taken hold in the government,” the survey says, seemingly crediting the economic reforms to the pressure created by the tariffs.\n\nThe survey posits that potential economic growth has risen from 6.5 percent to 7 percent boosted by sustained economic reforms intended to boost ease of doing business. Major steps include FDI reforms, the introduction of production-linked schemes (PLI), improving logistics, and simplifying tax laws. This has been supplemented by sustained investment in both physical and digital infrastructure. Effective capex in physical and digital, according to the survey, has reached 4 percent of GDP.\n\nAll this will lead to a rise in total factor productivity, a rise which translates into higher growth. TFP is something of a holy grail among economists. A rise in TFP implies greater efficiency due to smarter combinations of inputs of capital and labour. The survey estimates TFP growing at 1.9 percent between FY 26 and FY30, up from 1.7 percent in the immediate post-pandemic years.\n\nThat's only a return to the 1.9 percent growth between FY12-13 and FY 19-20. Similarly, the survey calculates a growth in capital stock of 7.6 percent in the next five fiscal years, higher than the 1.7 percent in the post-covid years. Between FY13 and FY20, growth was 7.6%.\n\nOngoing reforms, notably the free trade agreements (FTA) signed with the EU, UK and others, should further boost productivity. So should the investments in both physical and digital productivity.\n\nThe learning-by-doing, which will accompany the growth of new sectors such as semiconductors, electronics (a major success of the PLI policy) and defence equipment, should also help.\n\nThe survey argues that the higher cost of capital is high in India for structural reasons, namely the fact that the country has a persistent current account deficit. As a result, it needs to attract foreign capital for which it needs to pay a risk premium. Energy costs, too, need to come down.\n\nNonetheless, Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GDCF) now stands at 30.5 percent of GDP above the pre-pandemic average of 28.6 percent. GFCF as a percentage of GDP had been declining from FY13 to FY20 and further during the pandemic years, a trend that has now reversed.\n\nBoth consumption and investment are anchoring growth, the survey reiterates. The former stands at 61.5 percent of GDP in the first half of the current fiscal year, the highest since FY12.\n\nHowever, the Survey is far from Panglossian and posits that India is operating below its full strategic potential. Notably, the rupee is described as punching below its weight, causing foreign investors to pause.\n\nThe rupee's performance does not reflect India's \"stellar economic fundamentals\", according to the survey. It also flags the risk of what it refers to as \"disorderly multipolar breakdown\".\n\n“The paradox of 2025 is that India’s strongest macroeconomic performance in decades has collided with a global system that no longer rewards macroeconomic success with currency stability, capital inflows, or strategic insulation,” the survey complains.\n\nThe Survey also reiterates social concerns mentioned in previous editions, such as digital device addiction and obesity. It also flags the relatively low pay of gig workers, a topic of much recent debate.\n\n“The paradox of 2025 is that India’s strongest macroeconomic performance in decades has collided with a global system that no longer rewards macroeconomic success with currency\n\nstability, capital inflows, or strategic insulation,” the survey complains. Reducing imports sustainably by emulating the success of the electronics industry, which the survey hails, in other areas could resolve the conundrum.",

        "full_content": "As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, tax experts are increasingly calling for a reset of India’s long-term savings incentives, arguing that existing provisions have failed to keep pace with inflation, rising living costs and evolving employment patterns.\n\nA key area where taxpayers are demanding change is Section 80C of the Income-tax Act, which is available under the old tax regime, where the Rs 1.5 lakh deduction limit has remained unchanged for over a decade. Experts say this ceiling no longer reflects the financial realities of middle-class households that are simultaneously managing housing costs, education expenses and retirement planning. There is a strong expectation that Budget 2026 could raise this limit and extend enhanced deductions to the new tax regime as well, ensuring that long-term savings do not lose relevance as the simplified regime becomes the default.\n\nAccording to SR Patnaik, the current structure of Section 80C mixes long-term savings instruments with other eligible payments, diluting its effectiveness as a retirement-focused incentive. He believes carving out a separate, higher deduction exclusively for long-term savings could strengthen retirement readiness across income groups.\n\nBeyond deductions, experts are also pushing for reforms in capital gains and interest income taxation to revive investor confidence. Hari Raheja argues that long-term capital gains relief, preferential tax treatment for longer-tenure fixed deposits, and the reintroduction of tax-exempt dividends could meaningfully boost participation in financial markets. He also points to the need for innovative savings avenues, such as gold deposit schemes, and more liberal reinvestment limits in housing to channel household wealth into productive assets.\n\nThere is also growing support for separating genuine long-term savings from the crowded Section 80C basket. Ritika Nayyar notes that when multiple instruments compete for the same deduction limit, taxpayers often prioritise liquidity or deadline-driven options over long-term goals. A dedicated sub-limit for retirement-oriented products such as PPF, NPS and long-dated government bonds, she says, could encourage disciplined, goal-based saving and reduce the tendency for last-minute tax planning.\n\nBalancing long-term lock-ins with flexibility for younger investors remains another policy challenge. With job mobility and gig work becoming more common, experts stress that tax incentives must reward patience without trapping capital indefinitely. Gradually increasing tax benefits with longer holding periods, allowing limited early withdrawals, and enabling portability across jobs are seen as practical ways to make long-term saving less intimidating for younger earners.\n\nFor B. Shravanth Shanker, inflation-adjusted thresholds are critical to restoring the relevance of tax exemptions. He highlights the need to raise interest income deductions for both individuals and senior citizens, revisit stagnant homeloaninterest limits, and introduce targeted long-term capital gains relief to encourage genuine wealth creation. Importantly, he also flags gaps in the new tax regime, where the absence of dedicated retirement deductions could inadvertently weaken future financial security if left unaddressed.\n\nTaken together, these proposals point to a broader shift that experts hope Budget 2026 will initiate: moving tax policy away from fragmented, short-term incentives towards a clearer framework that rewards long-term commitment, supports retirement planning, and aligns household savings with India’s long-term growth needs.",

The real question is, do you want to simply watch that growth, or actually own a part of it?\n\nThe difference between where you put your money can be dramatic. The same Rs 1 lakh could grow into Rs 10 lakh over time, or remain stuck closer to Rs 3 lakh, depending on how you invest. That gap is where stocks come in.\n\nFor many young Indians, especially Gen Z, the stock market still feels intimidating or premature. But understanding how the stock market works often changes that perception.\n\nA brief history of stock investing\n\nStock investing isn’t a modern invention. It began in the 1600s in Amsterdam, when the Dutch East India Company became the first firm to issue shares to the public, allowing ordinary people to own a piece of a business.\n\nIndia’s own stock market journey started in 1875 with the formation of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Today, India has two major exchanges, the BSE and the NSE, with millions of investors trading daily. From Infosys in the 1990s to Zomato’s IPO in 2021, equities have become the primary way Indians participate in the growth of companies they interact with every day.\n\nHow the stock market actually works\n\nAt its core, the stock market is a marketplace for ownership. When you buy shares of a company like Reliance or TCS, you are buying a small stake in that business.\n\nShare prices move based on demand and supply. If more investors want to buy a stock, its price rises; if more want to sell, it falls. Companies raise capital by issuing shares, and investors benefit as those businesses grow and become more profitable. When done right, it’s a mutually beneficial system, companies get funding, and investors get a chance to build wealth.\n\nWhy stocks deserve a place in your portfolio\n\nThere are four key reasons stocks remain one of the most powerful wealth-building tools:\n\nBeating inflation:Inflation in India averages around 5-6 percent. If your money is parked in savings accounts or fixed deposits earning similar returns, your purchasing power barely grows. Equities, on the other hand, have historically delivered returns of 10-12 percent over the long term, helping money grow faster than rising prices.Capital growth:Equities allow investors to participate in the growth of successful businesses. Early investors in companies like Infosys saw wealth creation that traditional instruments could never match.Dividend income:Some companies share profits with shareholders through dividends, offering a steady stream of passive income in addition to price appreciation.Diversification:You don’t need to bet on a single stock. Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds allow investors to spread money across sectors such as technology, pharma, and FMCG, reducing risk while staying invested in equities.\n\nIs your 20s too early to invest? Actually, it’s ideal\n\nIf there’s one word young investors should remember, it’s compounding. The earlier you start, the longer your money has to multiply. Starting in your 20s gives your investments decades to grow, dramatically increasing the final outcome. Waiting until your 30s or 40s can significantly reduce that potential.\n\nStocks are no longer just for seasoned traders or “Dalal Street veterans.” They are for first-job earners, startup dreamers, and digital natives who want their money to work as hard as they do.\n\nStart small. Stay consistent. Let time and compounding do the heavy lifting. Because while the best time to invest may have been yesterday, the second-best time is today.",

The objective of QCOs is to ensure that products sold in the domestic market meet stipulated quality standards, while avoiding market distortions and safeguarding consumer interests, it further added.\n\nThe Survey credited QCOs with delivering tangible gains in certain sectors. In toys, for instance, stricter quality norms helped curb sub-standard imports while also supporting the development of a domestic manufacturing base and boosting exports.\n\nHowever, the Survey cautioned that design and execution are also important, particularly given the structure of India’s industrial ecosystem. “While the rationale is clear, the design and implementation of QCOs should be grounded in economic practicality,” it said, warning that mandatory certification is not cost-free and can create frictions if rolled out without adequate preparation.\n\nThis risk is especially pronounced for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which account for a large share of India’s manufacturing base. Sudden or poorly sequenced certification requirements can raise compliance costs, disrupt production cycles and strain working capital for smaller firms, the Survey noted.\n\nThe document also flagged challenges arising from globalised supply chains.\n\n“QCOs on intermediates therefore require exceptional caution,” the Survey said, stressing the need for flexibility where domestic capacity does not exist, particularly given the complexity of modern global production networks.\n\nTo address these concerns, the Survey called for a forward-looking QCO framework with rigorous pre-notification assessments, calibrated transition timelines and adequate expansion of national testing and certification infrastructure.",

In the United States, the live music industry generated over $130 billion and supported more than 900,000 jobs in 2019. In the UK, music tourism alone contributed £6.6 billion ($8.1 billion) in 2022—around 0.3 percent of GDP—highlighting strong spillovers to hospitality, transport and retail,” it said.\n\nCreative industries contribute between 0.5 percent and over 7 percent of GDP.\n\nThe survey highlighted a shortage of large-scale live event venues, restrictions on foreign payments to overseas performers, and the requirement for 10-15 separate clearances for organising events.\n\nTo address these gaps, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is working on a Single Window Mechanism for Live Entertainment Permissions, including approvals from state governments. The Survey also suggested opening heritage monuments for events and easing visa and foreign-exchange approvals for international artists.\n\nWith better facilitation and integration into tourism and city-branding strategies, the Survey said, the concert economy could emerge as a meaningful driver of growth for media and entertainment, tourism and allied urban services.",

They tell you the policy lapsed, but the premium you paid has supposedly grown into a much larger amount. All you need to do, they say, is buy a new policy so the money can be “transferred” and refunded.\n\nIt sounds tempting. It is also completely false.\n\nFirst things first: Bima Lokpal does not call you\n\nThe Insurance Ombudsman, also called the Bima Lokpal, does not call policyholders to offer refunds. No government body, regulator or ombudsman reaches out to individuals and promises them with unclaimed insurance money.\n\nThey do not ask you to buy new policies. They do not route refunds through fresh investments. And they certainly do not promise windfalls over phone calls.\n\nAny caller claiming otherwise is lying.\n\nThese scams are effective precisely because the caller sounds extremely confident. Fraudsters often have access to old policy data. They may know your name, the year you bought the policy and even the premium amount. When they give all these details to you over the phone, it lowers your guard.\n\nThey also create urgency. You are told the money will be refunded only if you act quickly. This pressure is deliberate. It is meant to stop you from checking independently.\n\nIf you feel rushed, that itself is a warning sign.\n\nThe biggest red flag: “Buy a new policy to get your money”\n\nThere is no legitimate insurance process where you must purchase a new policy to unlock or refund money from an old one. Once you pay for a new policy, the money is usually gone, and the promised refund never shows up.\n\nThis “transfer-and-refund” story is entirely made up.\n\nHow lapsed policies actually work\n\nIf your old policy was a traditional plan like an endowment or money-back policy, and it lapsed before it built any surrender value, the premiums are typically forfeited. There is nothing to refund.\n\nIf it was a Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP), the fund value does not disappear. When the policy lapses, the money moves into a discontinuation fund. That amount can be withdrawn only after five years, and only after applicable charges are deducted.\n\nIn neither case does Rs 50,000 magically become Rs 5 lakh.\n\nIf you want to know the status of an old policy, contact the insurance company directly. Use the official customer care number or website listed on the insurer’s own page. You can check whether any fund value exists and whether anything is payable.\n\nDo not rely on unsolicited calls. Do not share documents, OTPs or personal details. And never make payments based on promises of refunds.\n\nThis is a scam, plain and simple. In insurance, guaranteed windfalls, urgent deadlines and requests to buy new policies to release old money are classic warning signs. When in doubt, cut the call and check directly with the insurer. If the money is real, it will still be there tomorrow.",

        "full_content": "As Budget 2026 approaches, household investors are not looking for dramatic tax cuts or new exemptions. What they want instead is clarity, tax rules that allow them to invest according to their risk profile.\n\nOver the past two years, industry experts say changes in the taxation of investment products have quietly altered investor behaviour. While some of these measures were introduced in the name of parity or simplification, the result for many retail investors has been confusion and, in some cases, higher risk-taking.\n\nDebt funds and the conservative investor dilemma\n\nOne of the clearest examples is debt mutual funds. After indexation benefits were removed in 2023, debt funds lost much of their appeal for long-term investors seeking stability and tax efficiency.\n\nRahul Bhutoria, Director and Co-founder of Valtrust, says the impact was swift. “When indexation benefit for debt mutual funds was removed in March 2023, long-term investors stepped back, leading to weakening of inflows,” he notes. For conservative households, debt funds no longer serve as a reliable low-risk allocation in the way they once did.\n\nImportantly, the change did not significantly alter bank deposit behaviour. According to Dr. Gaurav Kulshreshtha, Chief Investment Officer, Nexedge Capital, bank deposit growth has continued at around 10-12 percent year-on-year. What has changed is where conservative money is going.\n\n“In the pursuit of better post-tax returns, conservative capital is increasingly moving toward higher credit risk or unintended equity exposure,” Kulshreshtha says. This shift, driven largely by tax outcomes rather than suitability, undermines traditional asset allocation principles in personal finance.\n\nRestoring capital gains taxation for debt mutual funds and similar products is therefore a key expectation from Budget 2026, not to boost returns, but to re-establish debt as a sensible option for low-risk investors.\n\nEquity investing: STT plus Capital Gains Burden\n\nTax complexity is not limited to debt. Equity investors today deal with multiple layers of taxation across the investment lifecycle, from Securities Transaction Tax at purchase to expense ratios during holding and capital gains tax at exit.\n\nManish Kothari, CEO of ZFunds, believes simplification is long overdue. “A more streamlined tax structure across these layers would improve transparency, reduce confusion, and ease the overall burden on investors,” he says. For retail investors, understanding true post-tax returns remains a challenge.\n\nHybrids and pension funds: similar goals, different tax outcomes\n\nHybrid mutual funds add another layer of inconsistency. Two hybrid schemes with similar risk-return profiles can face very different tax treatment due to technical classification thresholds. “Two products delivering similar outcomes should not face different tax outcomes,” Kothari argues, adding that taxation should reflect the economic nature of the product rather than rigid definitions.\n\nA similar mismatch exists in retirement planning. He explains, “Pension-oriented mutual funds and the National Pension System (NPS) both aim to provide post-retirement security, yet differences in tax treatment often push investors toward one product purely for tax reasons.”",

        "full_content": "ACKO Life on January 29 announced a strategic shift away from traditional life insurance models, committing exclusively to “pure protection” products as it seeks to address rising mis-selling and widening under-insurance in India.\n\nAccording to a press release, the move comes against the backdrop of a 14.3 percent year-on-year increase in mis-selling-related grievances across the insurance sector, as reported in the latest IRDAI Annual Report. By adopting what it calls an “unmixed” model, ACKO Life will offer only pure term life insurance products, consciously staying away from bundled insurance-investment offerings such as ULIPs and savings-linked policies.\n\nThe company said its approach is aimed at prioritising consumer protection over product complexity, positioning itself as a life insurer defined by what it refuses to sell rather than by product diversification.\n\nThe announcement comes at a time when the Indian life insurance sector is facing a structural contradiction. While total life insurance premiums have grown to nearly $100 billion, life insurance penetration has stagnated, declining to around 2.7 percent of GDP in FY25. Industry experts describe this as a situation where India is “insured on paper but unprotected in reality”.\n\nThis gap is reflected in the country’s growing mortality protection gap — the financial shortfall families face after the death of a primary earning member. According to the Swiss Re Institute, Asia’s mortality protection gap has widened 35 percent since 2017 to $132 billion, with India among the most vulnerable markets.\n\nACKO Life said decoupling insurance from investment is critical to addressing this deficit, arguing that mixed products dilute protection through high premiums, complex structures and lower cover values.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post, Varun Dua, Founder of ACKO, criticised investment-linked insurance products, stating that they often create an illusion of returns while delivering inadequate protection.\n\n“Life insurance has one job: to protect your loved ones from uncertainty. At ACKO Life, we made the hard choice of not mixing life insurance. We refuse to dilute protection with 50 other ‘benefits’ because we believe it doesn’t add any value. It only adds confusion,” Dua said.\n\nACKO Life said its “pure-play” strategy is designed to simplify consumer decision-making and improve insurance penetration by offering high-value, low-cost term cover focused solely on financial protection.\n\nFounded in 2016, ACKO entered the life insurance segment in 2023 after receiving regulatory approval, following its expansion across auto, health and travel insurance through a digital-first, direct-to-consumer model.",

Through the SARFESI, it has improved from 25.4 per cent in FY24 to 31.5 per cent in FY25, Economic Survey said.\n\nBanks’ profit after tax increased by 16.9 per cent (YoY) in FY25 and by 3.8 per cent (YoY) by September 2025.\n\nThe return on equity for SCBs has experienced a marginal decline from 13.8 per cent in March 2024 to 13.6 per cent in March 2025; however, it has maintained a steady upward trend since March 2020.\n\nOn the other hand, the return on assets has remained stable at 1.4 per cent in March 2025, consistent with the level recorded in March 2024.\n\nAs of September 2025, these metrics stand at 12.5 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively.\n\nIn FY26, a moderation in bank credit growth was observed across major sectors compared to the same period last year, though recent months have shown an uptick.\n\nAs of 31 December 2025, the (YoY) growth in outstanding credit by SCBs increased to 14.5 per cent compared to 11.2 per cent in December 2024. December 2025 marked the highest YoY growth rates for both bank credit and non-food credit in FY26 (up to December 2025).",

        "full_content": "ACKO Life on January 29 announced a strategic shift away from traditional life insurance models, committing exclusively to “pure protection” products as it seeks to address rising mis-selling and widening under-insurance in India.\n\nAccording to a press release, the move comes against the backdrop of a 14.3 percent year-on-year increase in mis-selling-related grievances across the insurance sector, as reported in the latest IRDAI Annual Report. By adopting what it calls an “unmixed” model, ACKO Life will offer only pure term life insurance products, consciously staying away from bundled insurance-investment offerings such as ULIPs and savings-linked policies.\n\nThe company said its approach is aimed at prioritising consumer protection over product complexity, positioning itself as a life insurer defined by what it refuses to sell rather than by product diversification.\n\nThe announcement comes at a time when the Indian life insurance sector is facing a structural contradiction. While total life insurance premiums have grown to nearly $100 billion, life insurance penetration has stagnated, declining to around 2.7 percent of GDP in FY25. Industry experts describe this as a situation where India is “insured on paper but unprotected in reality”.\n\nThis gap is reflected in the country’s growing mortality protection gap — the financial shortfall families face after the death of a primary earning member. According to the Swiss Re Institute, Asia’s mortality protection gap has widened 35 percent since 2017 to $132 billion, with India among the most vulnerable markets.\n\nACKO Life said decoupling insurance from investment is critical to addressing this deficit, arguing that mixed products dilute protection through high premiums, complex structures and lower cover values.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post, Varun Dua, Founder of ACKO, criticised investment-linked insurance products, stating that they often create an illusion of returns while delivering inadequate protection.\n\n“Life insurance has one job: to protect your loved ones from uncertainty. At ACKO Life, we made the hard choice of not mixing life insurance. We refuse to dilute protection with 50 other ‘benefits’ because we believe it doesn’t add any value. It only adds confusion,” Dua said.\n\nACKO Life said its “pure-play” strategy is designed to simplify consumer decision-making and improve insurance penetration by offering high-value, low-cost term cover focused solely on financial protection.\n\nFounded in 2016, ACKO entered the life insurance segment in 2023 after receiving regulatory approval, following its expansion across auto, health and travel insurance through a digital-first, direct-to-consumer model.",

The survey said the scheme provides structured incentives for shipbuilding within India, addressing cost disadvantages faced by domestic yards in global markets dominated by a few large players.\n\nSBFAS also includes a shipbreaking credit note of Rs 4,001 crore, aimed at promoting environmentally responsible recycling and supporting green shipbuilding practices. This aligns the shipbuilding push with India’s broader environmental and sustainability objectives, particularly as global shipping standards tighten around emissions and recycling norms.\n\nDedicated maritime financing architecture\n\nTo address long-standing financing constraints in the sector, the government has approved a Maritime Development Fund (MDF) of Rs 25,000 crore. According to the survey, the framework is intended to strengthen long-term sectoral financing, attract investment and promote public-private partnerships across shipbuilding and allied maritime activities.\n\nThe MDF comprises a Maritime Investment Fund of Rs 20,000 crore, with 49 percent participation from the Government of India, and an Interest Incentivisation Fund of Rs 5,000 crore designed to lower financing costs and improve project viability. The structure is aimed at crowding in private capital while reducing risk for lenders in a capital-intensive sector with long gestation periods, the survey said.\n\nScaling capacity and technology depth\n\nThe Shipbuilding Development Scheme (SbDS), with an outlay of Rs 19,989 crore, seeks to expand India’s shipbuilding capacity to 4.5 million gross tonnage annually. The survey said the scheme supports the development of greenfield mega shipbuilding clusters, modernisation of existing shipyards, and the provision of risk and insurance support for shipbuilding projects.\n\nIt also envisages the establishment of an India Ship Technology Centre to help develop domestic capabilities in shipbuilding design, manpower training, research and development, and coordination of testing facilities.\n\nAs part of the broader reform package, large ships above a specified size were included in the Infrastructure Harmonised Master List in September 2025. The move is intended to ease access to long-term finance by allowing eligible projects to tap infrastructure-linked funding channels, the Economic Survey said.",

These users saw net capital losses of Rs 1178 crores.\n\nFor Union Budget 2026, the crypto industry is seeking 30 percent capital gains tax rationalisation, provision for loss offset and re-evaluation of the 1 percent tax deducted at source (TDS).\n\nIndian exchanges directly deduct 1 percent TDS on all virtual digital asset transactions. At present, the TDS threshold is about Rs 10,000 per year for most categories of taxpayers, individuals and traders; and Rs 50,000 per year for small traders and specified persons.\n\nTotal TDS collected was at Rs 511.83 crores, out of which KoinX users contributed over Rs 130.16 crores (25.43 percent). Less than 5 percent of the users paid 87 percent of total TDS deducted.\n\nThe 1 percent TDS levied on transactions accounted for only about 0.60 percent of the overall turnover on domestic exchanges.\n\n“The 1% TDS on crypto transactions has become a significant liquidity factor in the Indian crypto market… This figure reflects transaction volume, not profitability. TDS is deducted per trade, making it a proxy for trading activity, not net gains,” the report noted.\n\nAgarwal explained, “During FY 2024–25, ₹19,280 crore of trading volume in our dataset occurred on Indian exchanges. Since TDS is deducted at 1% on sale transactions, the total TDS collected reflects only sell-side activity on domestic platforms, not total turnover.”\n\n“Additionally, a significant share of overall trading volume occurs on international exchanges, which further explains why TDS collections appear low relative to total trading volume,” he added.",

In October 2024, the cabinet approved a  Rs 1,000-crore venture capital fund under IN-SPACe to support space startups, followed by the launch of a Rs 500 crore Technology Adoption Fund in February next.\n\nIn the startups sector, Skyroot Aerospace and Agnikul Cosmos have conducted successful sub-orbital launches in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Several startups, including Pixxel Space, Azista, Hex20 and TakeMe2Space, have successfully launched satellites, the survey said.\n\nMore than 70 technologies have been transferred from Isro to private industry, helping firms scale up production and enter commercial markets, it said, adding foreign investment norms have also been liberalised.\n\nThe survey positions private participation as central to India’s long-term space ambitions under Space Vision 2047, which includes the Bharatiya Antariksh Station by 2035 and a crewed lunar mission by 2040.\n\nUpcoming missions such as Chandrayaan-4, Chandrayaan-5/LUPEX, the Venus Orbiter Mission and the Next Generation Launch Vehicle will create further opportunities for industry collaboration and technology development.\n\nThe Economic Survey 2025–26, prepared under the supervision of chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran, was tabled in Parliament by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.",

        "full_content": "The key takeaway from the Economic Survey 2025-26 tabled in Parliament on Thursday is that the India’s macroeconomic sweet spot, which is the outcome of sustained economic reforms, is being tested by geopolitics and a changing global order.\n\nAn undertone of confidence in domestic demand and growth comes through in the resilient 6.8-7.2 per cent growth projection for FY2027. The Survey also revised the potential growth rate up to 7.0 per cent from 6.5 per cent three years ago attributing credit to reforms and public investment. “Growth is good; the outlook remains favourable; inflation is contained; rainfall and agricultural prospects are supportive; external liabilities are low; banks are healthy; liquidity conditions are comfortable; credit growth is respectable; corporate balance sheets are strong; and the overall flow of funds to the commercial sector is robust. Policy dynamism and purposeful governance reinforce this backdrop.”\n\nIndia exits a turbulent FY2026 and enters FY2027 in a position of macroeconomic strength, domestic growth, anchored inflation, and improving fiscal health. The survey takes cognisance of reforms across taxation, financing institutions, capital markets, digitisation, and infrastructure which helped medium-term stability.\n\nHowever, in the backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions, what built India’s resilience to keep the growth engine is infrastructure. The document reiterates the Centre’s 89 per cent increase in capital outlay from Rs 5.92 lakh crore in FY2022 to a budgeted allocation of Rs 11.21 lakh crore for FY2026.\n\nHighlighting the importance of investing in roads, railways, ports, airports, it states that the multiplier effect in economic growth is most pronounced in infra capital expenditure (capex). This means, for every rupee spent by the government in creating infrastructure, GDP gains worth Rs 2.5-Rs 3.5.\n\nThat said, when public capital expenditure on infrastructure has expanded significantly, the end-result depends upon quality of project plans and execution. Cost overruns as a result of delays in execution, incomplete reports or inaccurate assessments are a given.\n\nAnother pertinent point made is the calibrated shift needed by the private sector, mainly in manufacturing, from a model that looks to import substitution towards one that focuses on scale, competitiveness innovation and integration into the global value chains. Here, the survey calls out India Inc. for its unwillingness to take risks that are beneficial in the long run.Companies need to step on the capex pedaland take bigger risks, make investments with longer time horizons, become globally competitive, and avoid rent-seeking, oligopolistic tendencies. It needs to increase private sector investment in research and development, technology adoption, skills, and quality systems.\n\nIndia’s industrial journey could be more fruitful if it aligns to the new geopolitical changes, supply-chain realignments, reworked trade agreements between nations and a more protectionist and fragmented global order.\n\nThis time around, the survey has gone a step further from being an annual narrative of economic health and the outlook ahead to a 799-page report that enlists how the government and industry should walk the talk.\n\nOf course, there’s no brushing aside the persistent weakness in the Indian rupee amid the domestic macroeconomic buoyancy. At present, in spite of dollar weakness, the INR is flirting with the 92 mark to the USD. My colleagueManas Chakravarty explains the reasons.\n\nThe biggest comfort in FY26 came from benign inflation that looks “anchored and tamed”. How long will this trend last?Read here.\n\nIndeed, a Survey document this long may have taken hours of burning the midnight oil to collate but will take even longer for investors to digest and extrapolate into investment decisions. Little wonder then that Indian equities surged initially to record daily highs before settling lower, just a tad above the previous day’s closing.

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey 2026 has called for the active use of “economic statecraft”, urging the government to strategically deploy economic tools to advance India’s foreign policy, national security and long-term strategic interests.\n\nThe emphasis comes as India remains among the world’s fastest-growing major economies for the fourth consecutive year.\n\nWhile underlining the relevance of economic statecraft in today’s geopolitical environment, the survey notes that the concept itself is far from new.\n\nIt specifically cites Chanakya, also known as Kautilya, and his seminal work Arthashastra as one of the earliest and most systematic treatises on statecraft, integrating economic governance with political and strategic imperatives.\n\nAccording to the survey, Arthashastra demonstrates how economic instruments such as trade regulation, taxation, resource management and state control were historically used to strengthen state power and achieve strategic objectives.\n\nBy invoking Chanakya, the survey places India’s modern economic strategy within a long civilisational tradition of linking economic policy to national security and diplomacy.\n\nThe survey also refers to historical examples beyond India, including the Megarian Decree imposed by ancient Athens and the Roman Empire’s grain provisioning system, Cura Annonae, as instances where economic measures were used to achieve strategic and political ends.\n\nExplaining the concept, the survey defines economic statecraft as the deliberate use of economic means to achieve strategic outcomes. Unlike conventional economic policy, which focuses on goals such as controlling inflation, managing deficits and promoting growth, economic statecraft goes further by using economic tools to influence the behaviour of other states, protect national security, or reshape geopolitical outcomes.\n\nIn the modern context, the survey notes that economic interdependence, once seen as a stabilising force, is increasingly viewed as a source of vulnerability. Pandemic-related disruptions, the weaponisation of energy and finance during global conflicts, and the growing use of export controls in advanced technologies have exposed the limits of efficiency-driven globalisation.\n\nAs a result, both advanced and emerging economies are reassessing their dependence on concentrated supply chains, critical raw materials and key technologies, often framing these shifts through the lens of national security. The Economic Survey argues that India must consciously use economic statecraft, rooted in both historical wisdom and contemporary realities, to navigate an increasingly contested global order.",

Between April-August FY26, Indian companies made investments worth $10.2 billion ,compared to $7.9 billion in the corresponding period last year.\n\n“The persistence of outflows despite global financial uncertainties underscores ongoing internationalisation by Indian enterprises,” CEA V Ananth Nageswaran said.\n\nThe survey states that between April 2023-August 2025, nearly 82 percent of cumulative ODI (Overseas Direct Investment) of $48.3 billion was directed to the top ten destination countries of Singapore (27 percent), the United States (16 percent), UAE (10 percent), Mauritius (9 percent) and the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (7 per centeach), reflecting both strategic-asset seeking in advanced markets and the use of international financial hubs.\n\nThe survey also pointed out that despite tighter financing conditions and heightened geopolitical uncertainty, FDI inflows to developing economies remained broadly stable at $867 billion (57 percent of global FDI) in CY 2024.

        "full_content": "The insurance sector has grown at a robust pace but costs, too, have increased steadily, with a significant portion of premiums being consumed by distribution overheads, the Economic Survey 2025–26, released on January 29, has said.\n\nWhile the total premium income scaled up sharply in FY25, growing to Rs 11.9 lakh crore from Rs 8.3 lakh crore in FY21, the survey said despite the push for digital transformation, customer acquisition continues to depend heavily on expensive intermediary networks instead of technology leading to cost rationalisation.\n\nThe central argument in the survey is that both life and non-life insurance segments are not taking advantage of digitisation to support both acquisition costs and restore ‘value for money’ to the policyholder.\n\nStructural challenges: high operating cost\n\nBeyond the industry’s success in deepening revenue from existing customers, the survey flagged a decline in insurance penetration to 3.7 percent. High distribution costs are preventing a widening of the risk pool. It is essential to lower overall costs and distribution outgoes to improve affordability to tap into the \"missing middle\" and reverse the decline in penetration.\n\nAccording to the survey, this structural constraint helps to understand why the escalating cost blocks the insurance sector’s evolution, creating distortions that limit inclusion, erode consumer value, and threaten long-term stability. The survey acknowledges that the cost of acquisition is not merely an operational friction.\n\nThe survey also draws a sharp distinction between private life insurers and the non-life sector's high-cost model strategies, posing a risk to the core financial strength of insurers.\n\nThe insurance sector has matured into one of the economy's deepest institutional pools of long-term capital but remains constrained by a \"low-penetration, high-cost\" equilibrium driven by a high-cost distribution model, it said.\n\n“Even after years of digital investment, most policies are still sold through high-commission agents and intermediaries, which makes insurance more expensive for customers. That’s why we see a strange trend— people who already buy insurance are spending more, but overall coverage is not expanding much,” said Alay Razvi, Managing Partner, Accord Juris.\n\nThe survey said insurers are not taking advantage of the digitisation of distribution to support both acquisition costs and restore ‘value for money’ to the policyholder.\n\n“As a result, a significant portion of insurance premiums is consumed by distribution overheads rather than being channelled towards risk coverage, product innovation, or improved claims servicing,” said Atul Menon, Partner, King Stubb & Kasiva, Advocates and Attorneys.",

        "full_content": "If you invest in equities for long enough, one thing becomes clear very quickly: no single segment leads the market every year. Large caps do well in some phases, mid caps shine in others, and small caps can swing from stellar to painful within short periods.\n\nThat’s why many investors prefer funds that give exposure across market capitalisations instead of betting on just one segment. Flexi-cap and multi-cap funds are designed for exactly this purpose. On the surface, they sound similar. In practice, they behave very differently.\n\nWhy diversification across market caps matters\n\nRecent years are a good reminder of why diversification helps. In 2025, large-cap stocks delivered steady returns, mid caps were more muted, and small caps struggled. In other years, the order has been completely reversed.\n\nSince it’s almost impossible to consistently predict which segment will outperform next, spreading exposure helps smooth the journey and improves the odds of sensible long-term returns.\n\nBoth flexi-cap and multi-cap funds aim to do this, but they take different routes.\n\nWhat a flexi-cap fund really does\n\nA flexi-cap fund invests across large-, mid- and small-cap stocks, but without any compulsory allocation to each category. As long as at least 65 percent of the portfolio is in equities, the fund manager is free to decide where the money goes.\n\nThis flexibility is the key feature.\n\nIf the fund manager believes large caps are safer or better valued, the portfolio can tilt heavily in that direction. If mid and small caps look attractive, exposure can be increased there instead. The allocation can change meaningfully over time as market conditions and valuations shift.\n\nIn other words, with a flexi-cap fund, you are trusting the fund manager to actively move money between market-cap segments.\n\nHow multi-cap funds work differently\n\nMulti-cap funds follow stricter rules. They must invest at least 75 percent of their assets in equities, with a minimum of 25 percent each in large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap stocks at all times. The remaining 25 percent is flexible.\n\nThis structure ensures constant exposure to all three segments, regardless of market conditions. Even if small caps are expensive or volatile, the fund still needs to maintain that minimum allocation.\n\nThe upside is balance. The downside is limited flexibility.\n\nWhy this difference matters in real life\n\nIn a flexi-cap fund, the fund manager can actively reduce exposure to overheated segments and move to safer or better-valued areas. This can help manage risk during frothy phases, but it also means returns depend heavily on the manager’s judgement.\n\nIn a multi-cap fund, allocation discipline is built in. You always stay diversified, but the fund cannot fully step away from a struggling segment even if valuations look stretched or risks are rising.\n\nThis is why multi-cap funds can feel more volatile during sharp small-cap corrections, while flexi-cap funds may appear relatively calmer in the same phase.\n\nWhat the return numbers tell you — and what they don’t\n\nCategory-level data shows that multi-cap funds have delivered stronger returns than flexi-cap funds over some longer periods. But this doesn’t mean multi-cap funds are always better.\n\nIndividual fund performance varies widely. A well-managed flexi-cap fund can outperform many multi-cap funds, and vice versa. What matters more is whether the fund’s structure matches your comfort with risk and your expectations from the fund manager.\n\nPast returns are useful for context, not decision-making on their own.\n\nBoth flexi-cap and multi-cap funds are equity-heavy and suit investors with a long-term horizon, ideally five years or more.\n\nA flexi-cap fund may suit you if you are comfortable letting the fund manager make allocation calls and are okay with the portfolio looking very different from year to year. This works better for investors who trust active decision-making and can live with periods of underperformance.\n\nA multi-cap fund may suit you if you want built-in diversification across market caps at all times and prefer a more rule-based structure. You accept that the fund will always have exposure to all segments, even during tough phases.\n\nFlexi-cap and multi-cap funds are not competing products so much as different philosophies.\n\nOne relies on flexibility and fund manager judgement. The other relies on discipline and balance. Neither is inherently superior. The right choice depends on how much control you want the fund manager to have, how comfortable you are with volatility, and how patiently you can stay invested through market cycles.\n\nIf you understand what each fund is designed to do, choosing between them becomes much simpler.",

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey 2026 indicates a major shift in India's household financial savings over the past decade, reflecting a fundamental change in how additional financial resources are allocated.\n\nThe transition is characterised by a steady shift towards market-linked instruments, especially equities, reflecting both structural changes in the financial system and changing household risk preferences, the survey, tabled in Parliament on January 29, has said.\n\nThe evolving equity orientation is also evident in the flow of household financial savings. Between FY12 and FY25, gross financial savings increased substantially, accompanied by a notable reallocation across instruments.\n\n\"The share of equity and mutual funds in annual household financial savings increased from around 2 percent in FY12 to over 15.2 per cent in FY25. This shift has coincided with a steady rise in SIP contributions, with average monthly SIP flows increasing seven times from under Rs 4,000 crore in FY17 to over Rs 28,000 crore in FY26 (April-November),\" it said.\n\nEquity investments, once secondary to household balance sheets, are now a major part of financial wealth, supported by broader participation and more diverse access channels. The growth of debt-linked instrument markets is a logical next step toward achieving balanced, diversified portfolios and meeting long-term financial objectives.\n\nThe growing prevalence of systematic investments reflects a shift towards long-term and sustained household engagement with savings being channelled in a disciplined manner across market cycles. In contrast, the share of term deposits declined from over 58 percent in FY12 to around 35 percent in FY25, after having fallen to as low as 31.9 per cent in FY22, the survey said.\n\nThis pattern indicates portfolio diversification rather than displacement, with households adding equity exposure to their existing savings instead of completely substituting away from traditional instruments.\n\nA notable aspect of the move to equities is the growing proportion of individuals in total equity market ownership, accomplished through both direct and indirect means.\n\n“The share of individual investors increased from around 11 percent in FY14 to 14.3 percent in FY19, and further to 18.8 per cent by September 2025. In absolute terms, individual equity holdings expanded to around Rs 84 lakh crore by September 2025, from just Rs 8 lakh crore in FY14,” it said.\n\nWhile the direct participation of individuals in equity markets grew slowly, rising from just under 8 percent in FY14 to around 9.6 percent by September 2025, the indirect share nearly tripled, reaching 9.2 percent during the same period. From April 2020 to September 2025, household equity wealth is estimated to have grown by about Rs 53 lakh crore. This highlights how ongoing engagement in the markets has been crucial for long-term wealth building.",

        "full_content": "The next phase of India’s industrial growth will depend less on protection and more on scale, technology adoption, innovation and deeper integration into global value chains, the Economic Survey 2025-26, tabled in Parliament on January  29, has said.\n\nThe survey pegs manufacturing as central to India’s long-term growth ambitions, as global supply chains undergo structural realignments. Competitiveness is increasingly determined not by low-cost labour alone but by technological capability, reliability and strategic relevance within global production networks, it said.\n\nFor India to emerge as a high-productivity manufacturing hub, the survey emphasised the need for stable, innovation-friendly policies and sustained reforms across ease of doing business, R&D and innovation, skilling, infrastructure and logistics, and MSME scaling.\n\nA key recommendation is to move toward mission-driven manufacturing policy through the National Manufacturing Mission. The survey positioned the mission as the long-term blueprint to expand manufacturing capacity, accelerate technology adoption and deepen MSME integration into domestic and global supply chains.\n\nThe long-term vision is ambitious, targeting a doubling of manufacturing’s share in GDP to 25 percent by 2035, generating around 143 million jobs and pushing merchandise exports toward $1.2 trillion.\n\nThe survey also recommended continuing targeted incentive-based industrial policy in strategic sectors through schemes such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) programme.\n\nPLI schemes, now spanning 14 sectors with an outlay of Rs 1.97 lakh crore, have already helped attract more than Rs 2 lakh crore in investments, generate incremental production of over Rs 18.7 lakh crore and support employment generation of more than 12.6 lakh, it said.\n\nThe policy signal is that targeted, scale-linked incentives can help anchor global supply chains in India when combined with domestic capability building.\n\nBeyond incentives, the survey favoured innovation-led manufacturing. It stressed the need for India to transition from a technology adopter to a global innovator, supported by initiatives such as the Anusandhan National Research Foundation and research and innovation funding mechanisms aimed at crowding in private R&D investment and accelerating capability development in strategic sectors.\n\nThe survey also linked manufacturing competitiveness directly to infrastructure and logistics efficiency. Initiatives such as PM GatiShakti and the National Industrial Corridor Development Programme are critical to reducing logistics costs, improving supply chain reliability and enabling large-scale industrial growth. Infrastructure is positioned not just as a growth enabler but as a core determinant of manufacturing competitiveness.\n\nAnother recommendation is to accelerate MSME integration into larger value chains. Long-term manufacturing growth and job creation will depend on the ability of smaller firms to scale, adopt technology and participate in global supply networks rather than remain fragmented and domestically focused, it said.",

        "full_content": "The current state of private investment and signals about its likely trajectory make up an important strand of the Survey. In this context, it identifies the cost of capital as an important influence on the level and growth of private investment.\n\nOver a 30-year period (1995 to 2025), the weighted average interest rate in India averaged 7.61%. It was much higher than Switzerland’s 1.04% but far lower than that of another emerging market, Indonesia, where the rate was 14.1%.\n\nLink between CAD and interest rates\n\nThe Survey unpacks the factors that influence the level of interest rates and concludes that the most important structural explanation for India’s relatively high cost of capital is linked to the overall savings position. This, in turn, has its roots in a persistent current account deficit (CAD). Consequently, there’s a risk premium which is priced into interest rates as well as equity returns.\n\nThe point here is that India’s persistent CAD is undermining industrial competitiveness and acting as a drag on investment. Find a way to get rid of this deficit on the external front and an important drag on investment goes away.\n\nIndia doesn’t do too badly when it comes to CAD, particularly when seen in a global context. At a little over 1% of GDP, India’s current CAD level puts it in the same category as Australia or UK.\n\nThe primary reason for it is that the services exports have been the foundation on which the Balance of Payments has coped with multiple shocks over the last six years.\n\nIn FY25, services exports hit a record of $387.5 billion and the trade surplus in this segment was $188.8 billion.  It is this surplus which offset about two-third of the merchandise trade deficit. Take away services exports from the equation, the situation would have been precarious.\n\nYet, services exports are treated with a lens that may have been relevant in another era but is inconsistent with evidence across the world.\n\nAccording to Survey, services are not a substitute for a goods-based export ecosystem that underpins resilient currency and external stability.\n\nWhy? Services exports do not compel broad upgrades in state capacity, argues the Survey.\n\nWhat global evidence teaches us\n\nEven within India, the pressure on state governments, Karnataka being the prime example, to upgrade their ability to cope with urban demands suggests otherwise.\n\nThat said, there’s a more important reason why the Survey and, by extension, the general policy approach underestimates the importance of what services can do for the Indian economy.\n\nThe World Bank in 2021 took a look at the changing nature of global development in a report titled‘At Your Service? The Promise of Services-Led Development’.\n\nAmongst its key findings were that the line of demarcation between services and manufacturing was increasingly hazy. A classic example of manufacturing prowess such as the automobile industry is no longer free of services inputs.\n\nFor example, the World Bank report said that software-related services contributed 40% of the value of a 2010 GM Chevy Volt model. If anything, the contribution of the services industry in automobiles will only represent a much larger value in future.\n\nEven in the case of China, the global manufacturing powerhouse, data tells us a counterintuitive story. The number of jobs and wages supported by the export of business services exceeds that of manufactured goods in China. That is the case in India too.\n\nOne legitimate complaint about services is that is not a monolith. A lot of services in India are characterized by limited value addition and low wages. Even that is not a good enough for policy making to underestimate the contribution of services.\n\nData from the World Bank report shows that labour productivity in informal services has been consistently higher than agriculture since 1990.\n\nNone of these facts support a case for ignoring manufacturing when it comes to policy and resource allocation. But these facts do make a case that India’s’ on to a good thing when it comes to services. Therefore, it’s unwise to underrate its potential and, thereby, pay inadequate attention to what makes it work.\n\nThat’s precisely what the debate about Bengaluru’s urban woe is.",

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey 2025–26 has suggested that the government could consider amending the definition of a “government company” under the Companies Act to enable greater equity monetisation from central public sector enterprises (CPSEs), while retaining effective control through special resolution rights.\n\nThe Survey pointed out that current legal constraints are limiting further disinvestment in a significant share of listed CPSEs. “Currently, in about 30 per cent of listed CPSEs, Government shareholding is already below 60 per cent, limiting further disinvestment through OFS, as it is stipulated in the Companies Act that a ‘government company’ must have at least 51 per cent of its stake held by the central or state government,” it said.\n\n“Going forward, receipts from equity monetisation can be strengthened by selectively reducing Government equity in certain CPSEs beyond the minimum public shareholding norms,” the Survey said, adding that such decisions should be “guided by market conditions and enterprise-specific factors”.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey in Parliament on January 29.\n\nThe Survey noted that effective control does not require majority ownership. “Since effective control requires only about a 26 per cent stake, the Government could consider amending the definition of ‘Government Company’ under the Companies Act, limited to listed entities, to allow them to remain as government companies with a minimum of 26 per cent ownership,” it said.\n\nSuch a change, the Survey said, would allow the government to “retain special resolution rights, while enabling the government to monetise its stake”. This approach, it added, could unlock additional equity monetisation without diluting strategic control over key enterprises.\n\nAlternative route: phased exit without legal change\n\nThe Survey also outlined an alternative path if the government’s objective is eventual privatisation. “Alternatively, if the objective is eventual privatisation, the Government could continue phased OFS below 51 per cent and even towards full exit, without changing the legal definition of ‘government company’,” it said.\n\nThis approach would enable CPSEs to operate after disinvestment “as professionally managed entities with dispersed ownership, clear governance standards, and transparent succession frameworks,” the Survey noted.\n\nRecycling disinvestment proceeds\n\nThe Survey further suggested that disinvestment receipts could be channelled towards future-oriented investments. “A portion of disinvestment receipts could also be earmarked for strategic investments in emerging technology and innovation-driven companies through professionally managed platforms such as the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), thereby recycling public capital toward future growth sectors,” it said.\n\n“This will also ensure a steady stream of disinvestment receipts into the future,” the Survey added.\n\nStrategic disinvestment progress\n\nAccording to the Survey, strategic disinvestment has proceeded in a calibrated manner in recent years. “Since 2016, in-principle approval has been accorded for strategic disinvestment for 36 CPSEs, of which 13 transactions have been completed, with the remainder at various stages of implementation,” it said.\n\nDuring FY26, the government also moved ahead with stake dilution and exits from select joint ventures. “During FY26, approvals were also accorded for stake dilution or exit from select joint ventures, including NTPC’s divestment from Utility Powertech Limited,” the Survey said.\n\nThese steps, it added, were supported by broader governance reforms. “These actions were complemented by governance reforms that empowered CPSE Boards to undertake the closure, merger, or disinvestment of subsidiaries,” the Survey said.\n\nTaken together, the Survey’s assessment suggests that a combination of legal flexibility, calibrated disinvestment and governance reforms could expand equity monetisation options for the government, while strengthening CPSE governance and redeploying public capital towards emerging growth areas.",

        "full_content": "The government’s decision to replace the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) stems from deep-seated structural and implementation failures, despite the programme’s success in boosting rural incomes and assets, the Economic Survey said on January 29.\n\nWhile acknowledging that MGNREGS played a critical role in enhancing rural incomes, improving village connectivity and accelerating digital adoption, the Survey flagged persistent gaps between intent and execution across states.\n\n“Monitoring in several states revealed gaps, including work not being done on the ground, expenditure not matching physical progress, the use of machines in labour-intensive work, and frequent bypassing of digital attendance systems,” the Survey noted.\n\nThe Survey argued that although MGNREGS expanded participation and improved transparency through digitisation, structural weaknesses in accountability and outcomes remained unresolved. In many instances, spending failed to translate into durable asset creation or productivity gains, while leakages and poor monitoring diluted the programme’s effectiveness as a safety net.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the government has enacted the Viksit Bharat–Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act, 2025, or the VB G-RAM G Act, 2025, marking a statutory overhaul of rural employment policy.\n\nAccording to the Survey, the new framework seeks to align rural employment with the government’s long-term vision of Viksit Bharat 2047, while tightening accountability and focusing more sharply on infrastructure outcomes and income security.\n\nThe VB G-RAM G Act, the Survey said, represents a decisive shift in approach, addressing operational shortcomings of MGNREGS through a more modern, accountable and outcome-oriented framework.",

In FY20 the total EV registrations in the country stood at around 0.1-0.2 million.\n\nElectric passenger vehicle registrations crossed the 100,000 mark for the first time in FY25, registering an 18 percent increase compared to the previous year.\n\nElectric two-wheelers continued to dominate the segment, with registrations growing by 21 percent in FY25 to reach 1.15 million units, underlining their role as the primary driver of EV adoption in India.\n\nThe strong growth trajectory has been supported by multiple policy interventions launched by the Centre to promote electric mobility. One of the key initiatives is the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for the Automobile and Auto Components Industry, approved in September 2021 with an outlay of Rs 25,938 crore. The scheme, which incentivises high-value advanced automotive technology vehicles and components, has attracted cumulative investments worth Rs 35,657 crore till September 2025.\n\nAnother major pillar is the PLI scheme for the National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage, with an outlay of Rs 18,100 crore for 50 GWh capacity. Under the scheme, 40 GWh of capacity has already been awarded, helping localise battery manufacturing and strengthen the domestic EV ecosystem.\n\nIn September 2024, the government also launched the PM E-Drive scheme with an outlay of Rs 10,900 crore. The programme provides demand incentives for electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers, while extending support to new segments such as e-trucks and e-ambulances. It also includes funding for charging infrastructure and upgrades of vehicle testing agencies.\n\nFurther boosting public transport electrification, the Centre notified the PM e-Bus Sewa–Payment Security Mechanism (PSM) scheme in October 2024, with an estimated outlay of Rs 3,435.33 crore. The scheme aims to support the deployment of over 38,000 electric buses by providing payment security to operators and OEMs in case of defaults by public transport authorities.\n\nThe Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) had previously said that government policy interventions, combined with a growing number of EV launches by manufacturers, have provided strong momentum for the adoption of electric vehicles across the country.",

        "full_content": "The government rolled out Phase II of its Compliance Reduction and Deregulation initiative in January 2026, expanding the scope of reforms across key sectors such as land, building and construction, labour, environment, education, health, utilities and overarching regulatory frameworks, the Economic Survey 2025–26 said.\n\nThe Survey said the initiative reflects a broader reorientation of governance towards strengthening state capacity through the disciplined removal of regulatory frictions. “The Economic Survey brings together these three elements – state capacity, the society, and deregulation – in the pursuit of Viksit Bharat and global influence. A strong and stable currency would be a natural corollary of that,” it said.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the survey in Parliament on January 29.\n\nPhase I outcomes encouraging, Phase II broadens scope\n\nAccording to the Survey, outcomes from the first phase of deregulation have been encouraging. “The experience of Phase I illustrates a broader lesson of this chapter: that state capacity is built not only through new institutions or additional controls, but through disciplined removal of frictions that impede productive activity,” it said.\n\nBuilding on this experience, “Phase II of the Compliance Reduction and Deregulation initiative was rolled out in January 2026 to cover additional priority areas, including land, building and construction, utilities and permissions, environment, education, health, labour, and overarching reforms,” the Survey noted.\n\n“The current phase of deregulation demonstrates how disciplined removal of friction can strengthen state capacity at scale,” it added.\n\nDeregulation as institutional reorientation\n\n“Deregulation, when pursued as a continuous and coordinated governance process, is not a retreat of the State but a strengthening of it,” it said.\n\nBy “simplifying rules, clarifying responsibilities, and making processes predictable and time-bound, administrative effort is shifted away from low-value policing toward problem-solving, monitoring, and execution,” the Survey said, adding that deregulation thus becomes “not only a pro-business reform, but a mechanism for building state capacity itself”.\n\nThe chapter also examined the compliance reduction initiative as a practical demonstration of institutional capability. “Deregulation is treated not as regulatory withdrawal, but as institutional reorientation, shifting administrative effort from low-value policing toward coordination, facilitation, and problem-solving,” it said.\n\nTask Force driving coordinated reform\n\nThe Survey detailed the role of the Task Force on Compliance Reduction and Deregulation, constituted in January 2025 under the chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary T.V. Somanathan. The Task Force was set up “to drive reforms that simplify regulations and streamline procedures across States and Union Territories”.\n\nIts objectives include identifying “redundant, overlapping, or outdated compliances”, guiding States in amending laws and procedures, encouraging standardised reform templates, facilitating risk-based compliance frameworks, promoting digitisation of government-to-business services through a countrywide Single Window System, and documenting best practices for replication.\n\n“What distinguishes this exercise from earlier deregulation drives is not only the number of reforms, but the institutional process: cross-agency coordination, iterative problem-solving with States, and real-time learning,” the Survey said.\n\nPriority areas and state-level momentum\n\nThe Task Force identified 23 Priority Areas across five broad sectors – Land Use, Building and Construction, Labour, Utilities and Permissions, and Overarching Priorities – covering a large share of regulatory interactions between enterprises and the State.\n\nBeyond common templates, “several States and Union Territories have undertaken innovative reforms that go beyond the common reform templates, tailored to their specific administrative, economic, and spatial contexts,” the Survey said. This, it added, demonstrates how deregulation is being internalised as “a continuous governance process rather than a checklist exercise”.\n\nThe Survey linked deregulation with broader economic outcomes. “Sustained state-level deregulation efforts are enabling small and medium enterprises to expand and integrate more effectively into formal value chains, elevating the economy’s medium-term growth potential,” it said.\n\nIndia has also recorded “significant employment growth in recent years, supported by structural reforms, tax rationalisation, and a sustained focus on skill development”. Measures such as deregulation, Goods and Services Tax reforms and labour reforms implemented by states have contributed to rising labour force participation and employment growth across industry and services.\n\nThe Survey noted that FY26 was marked by heightened external uncertainty, including penal tariffs affecting exporters. “The government responded by using this crisis as an opportunity to push through key measures such as GST rationalisation, faster progress on deregulation, and further simplification of compliance requirements across sectors,” it said.\n\nLooking ahead, the Survey said predictable and stable regulatory frameworks would be critical for reviving private capital expenditure. “Reviving private capital expenditure in such areas requires buffering sector-specific uncertainty by enhancing predictability through deregulation and simpler, more stable laws and frameworks,” it said.",

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey 2025-26 has proposed a national input cost reduction strategy, saying lowering the cost of energy, logistics, raw materials, compliance and others is as critical to industrial growth as building physical infrastructure.\n\nThe survey framed input costs as a form of “competitiveness infrastructure”, suggesting that elevated costs across supply chains act like a hidden tax on manufacturing, exports and job creation. It argued that for India to emerge as a globally competitive manufacturing hub, competitiveness must be both achievable and affordable across sectors, not limited to a few protected industries.\n\nIt cautioned that traditional industrial strategies centred on protecting final goods can backfire if input costs remain high. According to the survey, protecting downstream products while leaving raw material, energy and logistics costs elevated makes it harder for firms to scale production or compete internationally. Affordable and reliable inputs, it notes, are foundational to sustaining industrial growth and export competitiveness.\n\nThe survey flagged tariff inversion as a key risk. When duties on intermediate goods exceed those on finished products, domestic producers face higher costs than importers of finished goods, it said. This can encourage assembly-led imports instead of deeper domestic value addition, weakening manufacturing depth and reducing incentives for private investment. Correcting such distortions, the survey said, is a structural reform with economy-wide implications rather than a marginal trade policy adjustment.\n\nThe survey emphasised that input cost reform should be rule-based and economy-wide rather than sector-specific. Inputs widely used across industries should not be treated as revenue sources or protection instruments once domestic capacity is established. Protecting such inputs may benefit a narrow set of producers but raises costs for downstream sectors, weakening export competitiveness and job creation.\n\nThe survey also linked input costs directly to private investment behaviour. Thin margins in export-oriented manufacturing, high sensitivity among MSMEs and limited incentives to invest in technology upgrades make input costs a binding constraint on industrial expansion. In this context, lowering input costs can simultaneously strengthen multiple value chains and improve overall industrial productivity.\n\nBy treating input cost efficiency as a core policy priority, alongside infrastructure, logistics and regulatory simplification, the survey signals a shift toward a horizontal industrial strategy aimed at strengthening India’s position in global manufacturing and export markets.",

        "full_content": "Global financial markets were unsettled in the first half of calendar year (CY) 2025 following the US government's announcement of a series of tariff measures. The move triggered a sharp rise in global policy uncertainty, prompting investors to cut exposure to the US dollar and rotate towards traditional safe-haven assets, most notably gold.\n\nAccording to the Economic Survey 2026, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on January 29, global equity markets weakened and risk premiums widened across asset classes in April 2025. The spike in uncertainty led to heightened volatility across financial markets. However, conditions stabilised in the months that followed, as some of the US government’s policy announcements were rolled back and market volatility gradually returned to normal levels.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, gold emerged as a clear outperformer. Prices surged from $2,607 per ounce to $4,315 per ounce during 2025, supported by a weakening US dollar, expectations of persistently negative real interest rates, and growing investor concerns around geopolitical and financial tail risks, per the economic survey.\n\nBy contrast, global equities, represented by the MSCI World index (premier stock market index), delivered modest gains. After an early March dip, equities recovered and trended higher, but at a slower pace than gold. The gap between gold and global equities widened notably after September, suggesting investors increasingly favoured defensive assets over growth-linked ones.\n\nEmerging-market equities lagged even further, posting only gradual gains throughout the year.\n\nCorporate bond markets tell a third part of the story. US and euro high-yield spreads spiked sharply around April, signalling stress and risk aversion. However, spreads narrowed steadily afterwards, indicating improving credit conditions and stabilising investor confidence. Even so, this improvement in bonds did not translate into stronger equity performance.\n\nThe economic survey stated, \"Financial markets are typically the first to register and absorb the impact of an uncertainty shock. Much before agents across government, trade, and households adjust their choices, financial market participants tend to respond by pricing in uncertainty risk in real time. The year 2025 was marked by heightened uncertainty, which had a palpable impact on financial markets.\"\n\nThe survey also revealed that the impact of uncertainty on financial markets extends beyond just increased volatility and risk premiums. Research indicates that extended periods of uncertainty can influence the financial sector through at least three main channels. First, financial market participants tend to delay decisions when faced with uncertainty. Second, increased uncertainty can raise borrowing costs by widening credit spreads and financial intermediation expenses. Third, sustained uncertainty may lead to more significant market corrections across various asset classes.",

It added that universities should have the freedom to curate and offer courses based on industry requirements and students’ aptitudes.\n\n“Flexibility is the key to building capable talent in India,” the survey said, pointing to the Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhishthan Bill, 2025 as a foundational reform. It said the proposed legislation represents “an essential first step” in giving higher education institutions the autonomy to adapt their curricula in line with rapidly evolving technology trends.\n\n“As the floor for what is considered a fundamental skill shifts with every technological revolution, the passage of the bill will afford our higher education system the freedom to keep pace with the evolving world,” the survey said.\n\nThe document also called for a rethink of how policymakers define formal education and work experience. “Now is the time for policies to reevaluate what constitutes ‘formal education’ and what constitutes ‘work experience’,” it said, noting that the traditional separation between classrooms and industry exposure may no longer work in an AI-driven economy.\n\nIndia already has enabling frameworks in place to support such changes, the survey said.\n\n“With the National Education Policy 2020’s Multiple Entry Multiple Exit provisions, the Academic Bank of Credits, and the National Credit Framework, India has the policy infrastructure in place to make this vision real,” it added.",

        "full_content": "India’s gig workforce stands at 77 lakh workers, accounting for just over 2 percent of total employment, underscoring both the growing role and the still limited scale of platform-led work in the country’s labour market, according to the Economic Survey 2025–26.\n\nThe Survey notes that gig employment has expanded rapidly over the past few years alongside the growth of digital platforms, smartphone penetration and digital payments, while highlighting persistent challenges related to income stability, access to credit and social security coverage.\n\nData cited in the Survey shows that the gig workforce increased from around 77 lakh workers in FY21 to about 1.2 crore by FY25, a rise of nearly 55 percent in four years. Despite this growth, the sector continues to represent a small share of overall employment, reflecting the dominance of traditional jobs across agriculture, manufacturing and services.\n\nLooking ahead, the Survey estimates that non-agricultural gig work could account for 6.7 percent of India’s workforce by 2029–30, contributing as much as Rs 2.35 lakh crore to GDP, as platform-based work expands across delivery, logistics, transportation, IT services and other segments.\n\nSector-wise data shows that gig employment is concentrated in e-commerce and logistics, which together account for 52 lakh workers, with 37 lakh in e-commerce and 15 lakh in logistics. BFSI and manufacturing employ 10 lakh gig workers each, followed by retail at 7 lakh. Transportation and IT account for 6 lakh and 5 lakh workers, respectively.\n\nSmaller segments include healthcare, IT-enabled services, construction and education, with around 3 lakh workers each. Sectors such as automotive (1 lakh), hospitality (0.8 lakh), infrastructure (0.7 lakh), telecom (0.5 lakh) and power and energy (0.3 lakh) together form a relatively limited share of the overall gig workforce.\n\nThe Survey notes that demand for gig labour varies significantly by task type and skill level, ranging from high-turnover delivery and retail roles to specialised professionals such as programmers, physicians and legal consultants working across multiple clients.\n\nDespite the sector's expansion, the Survey flags income volatility as a key concern. Around 40 percent of gig workers earn less than Rs 15,000 per month, reflecting uneven demand, variable payouts and the absence of assured wages.\n\nIrregular earnings and limited employment histories have also resulted in restricted access to formal credit, with many gig workers falling into the “thin-file” category. Limited access to finance constrains their ability to invest in productive assets such as vehicles or specialised equipment, making it difficult to move into higher-paying gigs.\n\nAlgorithms and worker vulnerability\n\nThe Survey highlights the growing role of platform algorithms in determining work allocation, performance monitoring, wages and supply-demand matching. While these systems enable operational efficiency and scale, they also raise concerns around transparency, algorithmic bias and burnout.\n\nIt also notes that limited skilling and concerns over job losses linked to technological advances such as artificial intelligence and machine learning add to worker vulnerability, particularly in low-skilled gig roles.\n\nOn regulation, the Survey reiterates that gig and platform workers have been formally recognised under the Code on Social Security, while remaining outside traditional employer–employee relationships. It highlights the need to expand access to social security measures such as provident fund, insurance and maternity benefits through welfare frameworks and benefit portability.\n\nWhile referencing global regulatory developments such as the European Union’s Platform Workers’ Directive and Spain’s rider law, the Survey does not indicate any move towards employee reclassification in India.\n\nThe Survey states that policy efforts should focus on improving access to skilling, credit and productive assets, with the objective of enabling upward mobility and ensuring that gig work does not remain a low-income necessity. As the gig economy expands further, addressing income insecurity and strengthening worker protections will be key to sustaining its contribution to employment and economic growth.",

Currently, around 95 %  of the coking coal requirement of the steel sector is met through imports, leading to significant foreign exchange outgo,” it added.\n\nThe inclusion of coking coal in the category will likely facilitate faster approvals, improve ease of doing business and accelerate exploration and mining activities, including of deep-seated deposits, the government said. “Mining of critical minerals is exempt from public consultation requirements and permits the utilisation of degraded forest land for compensatory afforestation, measures that are also expected to encourage greater private sector participation,” it added.\n\nThe amendment is expected to reduce India’s import dependence, strengthen supply-chain resilience for the steel sector, and support the objectives of the National Steel Policy, according to the ministry.\n\nWhat the Economic Survey said about coal:\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey in the Parliament earlier today. According to the survey, coal “remains crucial” as India has the fifth-largest coal reserves and is the second-largest consumer. Coal contributes 55 percent to the national energy mix and fuels over 74 percent of total power generation, it added.\n\nThe survey noted that India’s coal industry reached historic heights in FY25, producing 1,047.52 million tonnes (MT) of coal. This marked a 4.98 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase from the Rs 997.83 MT. “This represents the highest coal production the country has ever achieved, demonstrating the industry's impressive growth and importance to India's energy needs,” it added.\n\n“Driven by this strong domestic output, imports registered a significant 7.9 per cent decline, falling from 264.53 MT in FY24 to 243.62 MT in FY25.15 Furthermore, the ratio of domestic production to consumption has also steadily improved over the past decade, as production growth has consistently outpaced consumption growth,” the Economic Survey further said.\n\nAdditionally, the survey noted that India’s steel industry faces critical dependence on imported Coking Coal. “To mitigate global supply risks, the Ministry of Coal launched Mission Coking Coal in 2022 with a view to significantly enhance domestic raw coking coal production to 140 MT by 2030,” it said.\n\nCoal India shares hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 456.95 apiece today. The stock has gained around 8 percent in one week, and 14 percent in one month.\n\nBharat Coking Coal shares made a stellar stock market debut on the exchanges earlier this month, listing with a premium of nearly 96 percent, following a massive subscription of 147 times between January 9-13 in the primary market.\n\nShares of Bharat Coking Coal Ltd were listed at Rs 45 per share on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). The stock has so far declined around 13 percent since listing.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

Nearly half of the issuances (about 47 per cent of total issuances) were concentrated in bonds maturing beyond 10 years. This provided the necessary support for managing rollover risk.\n\nOverall, the weighted average maturity (WAM) of borrowings stood at about 19.14 years in FY26 so far, compared with 20.66 years in FY25. The weighted average coupon (WAC) of fresh issuances during FY26 (as on 19 January 2026) has declined to 6.65 per cent as compared to 7.11 per cent in FY25.\n\nOver the longer term, the weighted average coupon on outstanding debt has fallen from 7.71 per cent in FY20 to 7.25 per cent in FY25.",

        "full_content": "The Centre is on track to reduce its fiscal deficit to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in FY26, fulfilling the commitment made in FY21 to halve the deficit ratio within five years, the Economic Survey 2025–26 said.\n\n“The government has targeted a fiscal deficit of 4.4 percent for FY26 and is on course to achieve it, thus fulfilling the commitment made in FY21,”  it said.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the survey in Parliament on January 29.\n\n“It is noteworthy that the government was determined to and succeeded in bringing down the fiscal deficit ratio as promised, despite it not being a legislative target,” the survey said, underlining the credibility of the consolidation path.\n\nThe adjustment was achieved even as expenditure quality improved. Fiscal consolidation, it said, took place “even while improving the quality of fiscal expenditure with a concurrent emphasis on capital expenditure”.\n\n“In the year of the pandemic, the fiscal deficit of the Central Government reached 9.2 per cent of GDP, partly on account of pandemic-related and induced expenditure and to a determination to bring below-the-line budget expenditures above the line,” the survey said, recalling the extraordinary fiscal expansion during the Covid-19 shock.\n\nThe sharp widening of the deficit was accompanied by a clear intent to end off-budget practices. “It also aimed to draw a line under such practices in the future,” the survey said, adding at the time, “the finance minister committed to reducing the Central Government’s fiscal deficit ratio by at least half in five years”.\n\nFollow our live blog for the latest on Economic Survey 2025-26\n\nMedium-term fiscal discipline under scrutiny\n\nThe survey emphasised that fiscal credibility has taken on greater importance in the current global environment, where capital flows are sensitive to policy predictability and debt dynamics. With government bonds now included in global indices, investors are increasingly assessing general government finances rather than focusing solely on the Centre.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, meeting the FY26 deficit target assumes particular significance, signalling the government’s intent to anchor expectations through disciplined fiscal management, it said.\n\nThe assessment suggests that adherence to the announced consolidation path, combined with a sustained push towards capital expenditure, has helped balance near-term growth support with medium-term stability, demonstrating that fiscal consolidation and growth-supportive spending need not be mutually exclusive when underpinned by credible policy intent and execution.\n\nCapital expenditure focus and credibility gains\n\nThe survey said the consolidation strategy was not driven by expenditure compression alone but by a reorientation towards growth-supportive spending, with a sustained emphasis on capital expenditure alongside revenue mobilisation and improved expenditure management.\n\nThis approach strengthened fiscal credibility at a time when global investors were increasingly focused on macro stability and medium-term fiscal anchors.\n\n“Among other things, the conservative and prudent approach to fiscal management, which enhanced fiscal credibility, led to India’s sovereign rating upgrades by several credit rating agencies in FY26,” it said.\n\nIndia got credit rating upgrades from multiple agencies in 2025, marking a significant shift after a prolonged period without upgrades. The upgrade by a major global rating agency was India’s first such improvement in nearly two decades, reflecting improved confidence in the country’s macroeconomic and fiscal trajectory, it said.",

        "full_content": "India’s push to rapidly expand data centres and AI compute capacity could face significant bottlenecks due to rising costs, infrastructure constraints and global shortages of critical hardware such as GPUs, the Economic Survey released on January 29 said.\n\nThe Survey said that while sufficient compute capacity is essential for training and developing cutting-edge artificial intelligence models, surging global demand for GPUs and limited supply of key components such as high-bandwidth memory chips and storage are pushing up costs. This could make the financial viability of large-scale data centre expansion increasingly challenging for India.\n\n“Even if the sovereign, domestic investors, or financial institutions are willing to finance data centre expansion, plans may need to be put on hold until GPU supplies are secured,” the Survey noted, highlighting that higher demand from international buyers could choke the availability of GPUs for domestic players.\n\nAccording to the Survey, the interaction between financial constraints, infrastructure readiness and external supply dependencies will determine the pace and scale of India’s AI compute expansion.\n\nIt cautioned that simply making financing available may not be sufficient if other bottlenecks such as grid availability or hardware access remain unresolved.\n\nTo analyse these risks, the Survey has proposed an Agent Based Modelling (ABM) framework, allowing financing, electricity grid capacity and access to hardware to interact through feedback loops. The objective is to identify scenarios where “coordination failures” can emerge, even when demand for AI infrastructure remains strong.\n\nThe government clarified that the exercise is a policy stress test rather than a forecasting tool. It does not attempt to estimate optimal compute capacity or exact investment needs. Instead, it seeks to uncover structural vulnerabilities in India’s AI infrastructure ecosystem and identify leverage points where policy interventions could be most effective.\n\nThe Survey also underlined the limits of price-based or subsidy-led approaches in isolation. When financial constraints, power infrastructure gaps and global hardware shortages coincide, subsidies alone may not accelerate capacity creation.",

        "full_content": "Amidst stability, credit growth has picked up again in the second half of the year. The Economic Survey tabled in Parliament by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on January 29 said that a key factor driving credit growth is a sharp increase in loans against gold jewellery, which have risen by 125.3 percent (YoY), possibly due to rising prices of the yellow metal.\n\n\"In terms of sectoral deployment of non-food credit, among the categories of agriculture and allied activities, industry, services and personalloans,the highest YoY growth has been observed in personal loans, with an increase of 12.8 per cent in November 2025. A significant factor contributing to this growth is a substantial rise in loans against gold jewellery, which have increased by 125.3 per cent (YoY), likely due to the increasing prices of gold,\" the survey said.\n\nAfter moderating earlier in FY26, lending picked up sharply towards the end of 2025. As of December, bank credit was growing at 14.5 per cent year-on-year. Personal loans have led this growth, especially loans against gold jewellery, which have surged due to rising gold prices.\n\nIndia’s banking system has demonstrated strong signs of stability, supported by healthier balance sheets, low bad loans, and consistent profits. Recent data indicates that scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) are in a much better position than a few years ago, and this improvement boosts overall economic confidence.\n\nOne of the biggest positives is asset quality. The gross non-performing asset (GNPA) ratio and net NPA ratio of SCBs have fallen to multi-decadal lows, indicating that banks are better managing stressed loans. At the same time, banks remain well capitalised. The capital-to-risk-weighted-asset ratio stood at a strong 17.2 percent in September 2025, per the economic survey.\n\nThe survey also revealed that bad loans in industry, services, and personal loans declined over the past six months. Industry GNPA fell to 1.9 percent, services to 1.8 percent, and personal loans to 1.1 percent by September.\n\nAgriculture remains a concern, with a higher GNPA of 6 percent, which improved slightly from 6.1 percent in March 2025.\n\nBanks are also recovering more money from stressed assets. Recovery rates have nearly doubled since FY18, aided by improved resolution mechanisms. \"The recovery rate in NPAs in SCBs has approximately doubled from 13.2 per cent in FY18 to 26.2 per cent in FY25,\" stated the Economic Survey.\n\nThe survey showed that the slippage ratio of SCBs, indicating the growth of NPAs relative to standard loans and advances at the start of the fiscal year, improved from 7.1 percent in FY18 to 1.4 percent in FY25, and declined further to 1.3 percent in the September quarter.",

        "full_content": "More and more people are looking to AI for getting budget breakdowns and retirement projections in seconds. It makes you wonder if you still need a human financial advisor at all. After all, an algorithm doesn’t forget details, doesn’t get tired, and doesn’t charge a percentage of your assets.\n\nThe short answer is this: AI can help you build a financial plan, but it still struggles to understand one.\n\nYou can use AI when the problem is structured and data-heavy. Give it your income, expenses, assets, liabilities, expected returns and time horizons, and it can generate scenarios almost instantly. It can model retirement cash flows, test different withdrawal rates, suggest asset allocations, and show how small changes today might affect outcomes decades later.\n\nFor people who like clarity and structure, this is powerful. AI tools are also great for education. They explain concepts, flag obvious gaps, and help you think through “what if” situations without judgement.\n\nUsed well, AI can make financial planning far more accessible and less intimidating.\n\nBut financial planning is not a maths exam. It sits at the intersection of money, behaviour, fear, family and uncertainty.\n\nAI doesn’t really know what it means when someone says, “I want to feel secure,” or “I’m scared of becoming a burden,” or “I don’t trust markets after what I lived through.” It can respond with words, but it doesn’t read between the lines.\n\nA human advisor notices hesitation, contradictions, and emotional blind spots. They recognise when a client says they want high returns but panics at a 10 percent fall. Or when someone insists on retiring early without fully acknowledging health risks or family responsibilities.\n\nThose gaps are often where financial plans fail.\n\nBehaviour matters more than optimisation\n\nMany people don’t run out of money because their plan was mathematically flawed. They run out because they abandoned it at the wrong time.\n\nThey stop investing during market crashes. They overspend when things feel comfortable. They delay uncomfortable decisions like insurance, wills, or reducing lifestyle costs.\n\nAI can recommend the “right” action. It cannot sit across from you and talk you out of a bad one when emotions take over.\n\nA good human advisor often adds value not by maximising returns, but by preventing costly mistakes.\n\nLife doesn’t stay inside templates\n\nAI works best with stable assumptions. Real life rarely cooperates.\n\nCareers change. Health issues appear. Parents age. Children take unexpected paths. Marriages evolve. Some plans need to be redrawn not because the numbers changed, but because priorities did.\n\nA human advisor adapts the plan around life. AI adapts life to the plan. That difference matters.\n\nThink of AI as a very capable co-pilot. It’s excellent for drafting a first version of a plan, stress-testing ideas, comparing options, and staying organised. It can help you prepare better questions, understand trade-offs, and keep track of your progress.\n\nFor people who are financially aware, disciplined, and comfortable making decisions, AI may be enough for large parts of the journey.\n\nBut when decisions involve trade-offs between security and freedom, between family needs and personal goals, or between fear and opportunity, human judgement still plays a critical role.\n\nThe choice isn’t AI or a human advisor. It’s how the two work together. AI reduces costs, improves clarity and democratizes access to planning tools. Human advisors bring context, empathy, accountability and experience.\n\nUsed together, they can produce better outcomes than either could alone.",

        "full_content": "Private investment in India remains constrained not by a lack of intent or financial stress but by deeper structural factors, which keeps corporates cautious on large expenditures, the Economic Survey 2025–26, released on January 29, has said.\n\nWhile public capex has scaled up sharply in recent years and corporate balance sheets are healthier, the survey argued that private investment will not automatically follow unless the cost of capital, institutional frictions and fiscal incentives are addressed more decisively.\n\nA central argument in the survey is that India’s cost of capital remains structurally high, limiting the appetite for long-gestation private projects.\n\nBeyond interest rates and banking spreads, the survey frames this as a macroeconomic outcome of India’s persistent current account deficit and dependence on foreign savings. Countries that rely on external capital, it argued, must pay a risk premium, making capital more expensive across the economy. As a result, even financially strong firms prefer incremental expansion, brownfield projects or services-led growth over large greenfield manufacturing investments.\n\nAccording to the survey, this structural constraint helps explain why India’s private investment response has been uneven despite a sustained public infrastructure push. The survey acknowledged that public capital expenditure has improved logistics, eased supply-side bottlenecks and raised the economy’s potential growth rate. Public capex can crowd in private investment only when complemented by predictable policies, lower input costs and stronger institutional capacity. Without these, public spending risks becoming a ceiling rather than a catalyst for private capex, the survey noted.\n\nThe survey also draws a sharp distinction between productive public investment and transfer-heavy fiscal strategies, particularly at the state level.\n\nWhile Centre's capex and interest-freeloansto states under the Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment scheme have helped protect infrastructure spending, the growing reliance on unconditional cash transfers by several states is flagged as a risk. Such spending, the survey said, raises revenue deficits and crowds out fiscal space for capital formation, indirectly dampening private investment sentiment by weakening the pipeline of infrastructure projects and complementary public goods.\n\nAnother reason for subdued private capex lies in the sectoral skew of investment, the economic survey said.\n\nThe survey explained why private investment has gravitated more towards services than manufacturing. Services firms can scale with lower fixed capital, bypass weak infrastructure, and adapt more quickly to regulatory or market changes. Manufacturing, by contrast, imposes “hard constraints” on land, power, logistics, skills and governance. Until these constraints are addressed comprehensively, private manufacturing investment is likely to remain selective rather than broad-based.\n\nThe survey also cautioned against relying on protectionist trade measures to stimulate private manufacturing investment.\n\nHigh tariffs in upstream sectors, it said , may provide temporary relief to capital-intensive producers but often raise costs for downstream industries, hurting export competitiveness and discouraging scale. Lowering the cost of capital, improving logistics and ensuring reliable energy supply are presented as more effective ways to revive private capex than negotiated tariff protection.\n\nUncertainty in the global environment further complicates the private investment outlook, the survey noted.\n\nIt highlighted rising geopolitical risks, trade fragmentation and volatile capital flows as factors that make firms more cautious about committing to long-term investments. In such an environment, policy credibility, regulatory stability and execution capacity become critical determinants of private investment decisions. Firms are more likely to invest when rules are predictable and approvals time-bound, even if global conditions remain uncertain.\n\nThe survey also pointed to asset monetisation and disinvestment as an underutilised lever to support both public and private investment.\n\nRecycling public capital from mature assets can fund fresh infrastructure projects, reduce pressure on public borrowing and create a pipeline of investable opportunities for long-term private capital, including pension funds and insurers. Done well, this approach can strengthen the link between public capex and private participation.",

While these risks remain manageable, they reinforce the importance of maintaining adequate buffers and policy credibility,” the Survey said.\n\nIndia and the United States have concluded six rounds of talks for a trade deal so far. Both nations have reaffirmed their commitment to continue dialogue with the aim of reaching an early conclusion of a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nThe recent US decision to exempt over 200 agricultural and food products from elevated tariffs marks a constructive shift in India–US trade dynamics. The move restores price competitiveness for key Indian exports, including spices, tea, coffee, nuts, and processed foods, helping offset earlier tariff pressures that had constrained market access, the Survey noted.\n\nThe Survey added that slower growth in key trading partners, tariff-induced trade disruptions, and volatility in capital flows could intermittently weigh on exports and investor sentiment.\n\nHowever, for India, these global conditions translate into external uncertainties rather than immediate macroeconomic stress.",

        "full_content": "Increased insurance penetration and the rapid expansion of the insurance sector will translate into the availability of long-term investable funds to support infrastructure growth, the Economic Survey 2026 has said, positioning insurance as a key pillar in financing India’s development ambitions alongside banking and capital markets.\n\nThe survey links structural reforms in the insurance ecosystem to the creation of a stable, long-duration capital base required for infrastructure financing, highlighting the enactment of the Sabka Bima, Sabki Suraksha Act, 2025 as a watershed moment for the sector.\n\nThe legislation, which raises the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in insurance companies from 74 percent to 100 percent, is expected to accelerate sectoral growth, expand penetration, and deepen India’s pool of long-term domestic savings.\n\nAccording to the survey, higher insurance penetration does not only improve household and enterprise-level risk protection but also strengthens financial intermediation by converting long-term premium inflows into patient capital.\n\nThis is particularly critical for infrastructure sectors such as roads, renewable energy, transport, urban development, and social infrastructure, which require long-tenure funding structures that traditional short-term bank lending cannot efficiently provide.\n\nFollow our live blog for the latest on Economic Survey 2025-26\n\nThe reform package also focuses on improving the operating environment for insurers and intermediaries. One-time registration for insurance intermediaries, relaxation of IRDAI approval norms for equity transfers, and the reduction in Net Owned Funds requirements for foreign reinsurers, from Rs 5,000 crore to Rs 1,000 crore, are expected to facilitate market entry, improve risk absorption capacity, and strengthen reinsurance depth in the domestic market.\n\nBeyond capital formation, the Act strengthens consumer trust and market integrity.\n\nThe creation of a Policyholders’ Education and Protection Fund aims to improve insurance awareness and financial literacy, while enhanced regulatory powers for the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), including the authority to disgorge wrongful gains and impose higher penalties, are designed to strengthen compliance and governance standards across insurers and intermediaries.\n\nThe alignment of insurance regulations with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 further integrates the sector with India’s digital public infrastructure, enabling scale while safeguarding policyholder data.",

        "full_content": "India operates just about 0.11 airports per million people, far below the United States’ 47.35 and China’s 0.39, underlining the vast untapped potential for expansion in the country’s civil aviation sector, the Economic Survey 2025–26 tabled by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman January 29 said.\n\nDespite the relatively sparse airport density, India has emerged as the world’s third-largest domestic aviation market, after the US and China. The Survey highlighted that the number of operational airports in the country has more than doubled to 164 in 2025 from 74 in 2014, reflecting a decade of rapid infrastructure creation and policy-led expansion.\n\nFurther capacity is in the pipeline. The government has granted in-principle approval for 24 greenfield airports, of which 13 are already operational, including the much-anticipated Navi Mumbai International Airport. These additions are expected to significantly ease congestion at metro hubs while strengthening regional and urban connectivity.\n\n“India’s civil aviation sector is on a sustained growth trajectory, supported by a conducive policy environment, rising demand and steady infrastructure expansion,” the Survey said. It noted, however, that the sector remains sensitive to global economic cycles and requires continuous capacity upgrades. Even so, current passenger volumes represent only a fraction of the country’s long-term potential.\n\nSince FY20, modernisation projects at airports across the country have increased the combined passenger-handling capacity of operational airports to around 575 million passengers per annum. In FY25, Indian airports handled 412 million passengers, marking a 10 percent increase over 374 million passengers in FY24.\n\nGovernment projections state that annual passenger traffic could rise to 665 million by FY31, driven by rising incomes, improved regional connectivity and continued urbanisation.\n\nA key driver of this growth has been the government’s regional connectivity push. As of FY25, 657 routes connecting 93 airports, including heliports and water aerodromes, have been operationalised, improving access to remote and aspirational regions while keeping air travel affordable.\n\nBuilding on this, the Survey noted that a modified UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) scheme has been announced. The revamped programme aims to connect 120 new destinations and enable air travel for 4 crore passengers over the next decade.\n\nThe Survey also pointed to steady progress in the air cargo segment. Air cargo volumes increased from 2.53 million metric tonnes (MMT) in FY15 to 3.72 MMT in FY25, while 2.95 MMT was handled in FY26 up to December. Growth has been supported by policy reforms, infrastructure upgrades and improved logistics integration.\n\nHowever, after registering a robust 10.5 percent growth in FY25, air cargo expansion moderated to about 5 percent during April–November 2025. According to industry assessments cited in the Survey, the slowdown reflects a mix of factors, including higher operating costs, capacity constraints, geopolitical uncertainties affecting international routes, and a normalisation of demand following strong growth in the previous year.\n\nBeyond airports and airlines, the Survey underscored the importance of a growing ancillary ecosystem. Expansion in airport and air navigation infrastructure, along with the development of Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facilities and aircraft leasing capabilities, is strengthening India’s aviation value chain.\n\n“These developments, coupled with deeper technology integration, position civil aviation as a key driver of nationwide economic connectivity and integration,” the Survey said.\n\nTaken together, the data suggests that while India has made significant strides in expanding its aviation footprint over the past decade, the low airport-to-population ratio leaves ample headroom for long-term growth, reinforcing aviation’s role as a critical enabler of economic development.",

The stock touched an intraday low of Rs 438.25.\n\nThe defence PSU on Wednesday reported a 20.4 percent rise in consolidated net profit for the December quarter, while revenue from operations grew nearly 24 percent year-on-year.\n\nBELshares have gained 36.3 per cent so far in 2025 and are up about 13 per cent in January.\n\nBrokerage firm CLSA maintained an ‘outperform’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 453, noting that third-quarter execution was better than expected. However, it said much of the optimism is already priced in, adding that near-term stock movement will depend on execution of the company’s large order backlog amid lumpy order inflows.\n\nKotak Institutional Equities reiterated its ‘sell’ rating with a target price of Rs 390, citing limited upside after the recent rally and an unfavourable risk-reward profile at current levels.\n\nJP Morgan, which has an ‘overweight’ rating on BEL with a target price of Rs 556, said the company’s earnings beat estimates but cautioned that margins may normalise. It added that growth will hinge on operating leverage and timely execution of orders.\n\nBEL is a constituent of the benchmark Nifty 50 index. The sharp decline in the stock also weighed on other defence stocks.\n\nThe Nifty Defence index, which had risen for two consecutive sessions, snapped its rally and fell up to 2 percent on Thursday amid profit booking.\n\nDefence stocks had rallied over the past two sessions after India and the European Union concluded a defence and security agreement aimed at enhancing cooperation in areas such as counter-terrorism, the Indo-Pacific and joint development of military hardware.\n\nThepact was finalised at the India-EU summitbetween Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, along with European Council President Antonio Costa. Officials said the agreement is expected to improve interoperability in the defence sector and create opportunities for Indian companies under the EU’s Security Action for Europe programme.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "India’s medium-term growth potential has strengthened to around 7 percent from 6.5 percent earlier, reflecting the cumulative impact of sustained policy reforms, strong macroeconomic fundamentals and improved growth momentum across key indicators, according to the Economic Survey 2025–26.\n\n“Together, the developments make a persuasive case that India’s potential growth has risen to around 7 per cent over the medium term,” the survey said, adding the economy is “positioned on a path of steady expansion amid global uncertainty”.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey in Parliament on January 29.\n\nAccording to the survey, the upward revision in potential growth reflects calibrated improvements across capital accumulation, labour input and trend total factor productivity (TFP). “When combined, these calibrated improvements in capital accumulation, labour input and trend TFP generate an upward shift in potential GDP growth from 6.5 per cent to around 7 per cent over the medium term,” it said.\n\nThe assessment, it added, reflects “the compounding effect of sustained reforms interacting with strong macro-financial fundamentals”. The balance of risks around growth remains “broadly even”, leading to an outlook of “steady growth amid global uncertainty, requiring caution, but not pessimism”.\n\nThe Survey noted that while global uncertainties remain elevated, domestic growth drivers are expected to continue supporting economic activity. “With macroeconomic stability in place and ongoing reform efforts, the economy appears well-positioned to sustain growth in the near term,” it said, outlining an outlook for FY27 shaped primarily by domestic strengths alongside evolving external conditions.\n\nHigh-frequency indicators signal stronger momentum\n\nThe Survey said the revised growth assessment is buttressed by higher growth trends observed in high-frequency indicators in recent years. Growth in e-way bill generation, purchasing managers’ index (PMI) indicators and non-food bank credit has “remained persistently above their respective pre-pandemic averages, rather than reverting to previous growth trends”.\n\n“This performance suggests a more robust underlying pace of economic activity and an improved growth momentum,” the Survey said, pointing to a strengthening of the economy’s medium-term trajectory.\n\nSustained deregulation efforts at the state level are also playing a key role. The Survey said these initiatives are “enabling small and medium enterprises to expand and integrate more effectively into formal value chains, elevating the economy’s medium-term growth potential”.\n\nIn parallel, direct and indirect tax reforms are expected to strengthen revenue flows over the medium term. This, the Survey said, would “directly reduce incremental borrowing requirements and, in turn, the interest burden as fiscal consolidation progresses”.\n\nOver the past three years, reform momentum has strengthened across several areas critical for medium-term growth. Manufacturing-oriented initiatives such as Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, foreign direct investment liberalisation and logistics reforms have supported capacity creation.\n\nThe Survey also pointed to tax simplification and the setting up of high-level committees for regulatory reforms, including those involving state governments, as signalling a shift towards greater regulatory clarity and certainty.\n\nImpact of Labour market reforms in medium term\n\nAs economic activity normalises, labour market reforms have also begun to take effect. The survey said labour law consolidation, reduced regulatory compliance and state-level reforms have “begun to lower frictions in the labour market”.\n\nSustained investments in education, skilling and the apprenticeship ecosystem are strengthening workforce quality and employability. “Taken together, these factors are likely to support a stabilisation of labour input growth over the medium term, at a level higher than pre-pandemic period,” the survey said.",

        "full_content": "India’s insurance sector's biggest change is simple but structural: reducing high distribution and acquisition costs, according to Economic Survey 2026.\n\nUnless these cost inefficiencies are dismantled, insurance will remain expensive for customers and limited in reach, despite the sector’s strong balance sheets and financial stability, the report says.\n\nFor years, the industry has operated in what can be called a “low-penetration, high-cost” model.\n\nInsurance companies are financially strong and well-capitalised, but the cost of selling insurance is too high, the report flags. Expensive distribution channels, heavy commissions, and inefficient acquisition models have pushed up the price of protection. This has made insurance less affordable for large sections of the population, keeping penetration low even as the industry grows in size.\n\nIn the life insurance segment, private insurers are showing healthy topline growth, but profits are not growing at the same pace. Rising acquisition expenses are eating into margins, leaving net profits largely flat.\n\nSimply put, insurers are selling more policies, but earning proportionally less from them because it costs too much to acquire each customer.\n\nThe non-life insurance sector faces a similar challenge, according to the report.\n\nHigh combined ratios mean that underwriting operations are not generating enough profits on their own. To stay profitable, insurers are increasingly relying on investment income to support their core business. This strategy is risky, as it makes profitability dependent on capital market performance rather than on the strength of insurance operations themselves.\n\nThe solution lies in rationalising acquisition and distribution costs, the report suggests.\n\nDigitising distribution, through direct platforms, embedded insurance, partnerships with fintechs and platforms, and technology-led sales models, can significantly reduce the cost of reaching customers. Lower costs would allow insurers to price products more accurately, offer better value to policyholders, and make insurance more affordable.",

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey 2025-26 has made an unambiguous pitch for capital expenditure as the central pillar of India’s growth strategy, arguing that sustained public investment in infrastructure has lifted the economy’s potential growth rate while crowding in private investment.\n\nThe survey, often described as the government’s report card on the economy, contrasts capital spending with transfer-heavy expenditure, warning that the latter offers only transient welfare gains, while capex delivers durable improvements in productivity, incomes and competitiveness.\n\nAt the Centre, the rebalancing of expenditure towards capital formation is presented as one of the most significant post-pandemic fiscal shifts.\n\nCapital expenditure has been scaled up from an average of about 1.7 percent of GDP in the pre-Covid period to around 3 percent of GDP after the pandemic, with effective capital expenditure reaching close to 4 percent of GDP in FY25. This expansion was made possible by a sharp rationalisation of revenue expenditure, which declined from 13.6 percent of GDP in FY22 to 10.9 percent in FY25, creating fiscal space for productive asset creation\n\nThe survey credits this improvement in expenditure quality for helping India sustain high public investment even while consolidating its fiscal deficit.\n\nFollow our live blog for the latest on Economic Survey 2025-26\n\nBetween FY20 and FY25, the share of capital spending in total central government expenditure rose from roughly 12.5 percent to 22.6 percent, a shift that has coincided with faster infrastructure build-out and easing of supply-side constraints. Rating agencies, which upgraded India’s sovereign rating in 2025, explicitly cited this pivot towards growth-enhancing capex as a key factor underpinning fiscal credibility\n\nThe survey highlighted infrastructure expansion, particularly in transport and logistics, as a major contributor to the upward revision in India’s potential growth rate to 7 percent. The survey pointed to the rapid expansion of airports, highways and inland waterways as reducing transaction costs and improving economy-wide efficiency, reinforcing the argument that public investment is now yielding tangible productivity dividends.\n\nThe survey also highlighted the role of the Centre in protecting capital expenditure at the state level through the Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI) scheme. Launched during the pandemic, the scheme provides 50-year interest-freeloansto states specifically for capital spending. Allocations under SASCI have risen sharply from Rs 12,000 crore in FY21 to Rs 1.5 lakh crore in FY26, with cumulative releases of nearly Rs 4.5 lakh crore since inception. As a result, state capital expenditure has remained broadly stable at around 2.4 percent of GDP despite rising fiscal pressures\n\nHowever, the survey also strikes a cautionary note. It flags the growing use of unconditional cash transfers by several states, warning that these schemes are increasing revenue deficits and crowding out growth-enhancing capital and human capital investments.\n\nWhile such transfers provide short-term income support, the survey argues they weaken long-term growth by diverting scarce fiscal resources away from infrastructure and productive asset creation\n\nThe survey underscored the need for recycling public capital through asset monetisation and strategic disinvestment. It suggests that proceeds from equity monetisation in public sector enterprises should increasingly be channelled into future-oriented infrastructure and technology investments, including through platforms such as the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), to sustain the capex cycle without overburdening public balance sheets\n\nThe broader message from the Economic Survey is that India’s capex push is no longer a counter-cyclical response but a structural strategy.\n\nCapital expenditure is positioned as the bridge between fiscal consolidation and long-term growth, with infrastructure spending seen as essential for crowding in private investment, improving export competitiveness and strengthening macroeconomic resilience. The survey’s warning is equally clear that diluting this strategy through populist spending risks undermining the very growth momentum that public investment has helped create.",

        "full_content": "If you own shares or equity mutual funds and need cash urgently, a loan against shares (LAS) can help. Taking a loan against your shares means you won’t have to sell your investments, avoid a capital gains tax at that moment, and the interest rate is often lower than an unsecured personal loan.\n\nBut LAS is not “easy money”. It is a secured loan tied tightly to market movements, and that changes the risk equation in ways many borrowers underestimate.\n\nWhat exactly is a loan against shares?\n\nWhen taking a loan against shares you can borrow money by pledging your listed shares or equity mutual fund units as collateral. The shares remain in your name, and you continue to get dividends or corporate benefits, but the lender has the right to sell them if you are unable to pay off the loan.\n\nTheseloansare offered by banks, NBFCs and brokers through a pledge mechanism linked to your DEMAT account. The loan amount is usually a percentage of the market value of the pledged securities, known as the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio.\n\nFor most equity shares, the LTV is around 40-50 percent. For equity mutual funds, it can go up to 50-60 percent, depending on the fund and the lender.\n\nHow the money is disbursed and repaid\n\nOnce your shares are pledged, the loan is either disbursed as a lump sum or set up as an overdraft facility. Interest is charged only on the amount you use, not on the full sanctioned limit.\n\nThis flexibility makes LAS attractive for short-term needs like business cash flow gaps, bridge financing, or covering an unexpected expense without disturbing long-term investments.\n\nRepayment terms vary. Some lenders expect periodic interest payments with the principal repaid at the end, while others allow partial repayments anytime.\n\nThe real risk: Market movements\n\nThis is where loans against shares differ sharply from most other loans.\n\nIf the market falls and the value of your pledged shares drops, your LTV shoots up automatically. When it crosses the lender’s comfort level, you get a margin call. That means you must either add more shares, bring in cash, or repay part of the loan.\n\nIf you don’t act quickly, the lender has the right to sell your shares to recover the loan, often at precisely the wrong time from an investor’s perspective.\n\nThis forced selling risk is the single biggest drawback of LAS.\n\nCosts you should look beyond interest rates\n\nInterest rates on LAS are usually lower than personal loans, but they are not the only cost. There may be pledge charges, renewal fees, and penal interest if margins are breached.\n\nAlso, because the loan is linked to volatile assets, the “mental cost” of constantly tracking markets is real. A sharp correction can turn a calm borrowing decision into a stressful one overnight.\n\nWhen a loan against shares makes sense\n\nLAS works best when the borrowing need is short-term and predictable, and when the pledged portfolio is diversified and not excessively volatile.\n\nIt can also make sense if selling your shares would trigger a large capital gains tax or disrupt a long-term investment plan, and you are confident you can repay or reduce the loan quickly.\n\nBusiness owners and self-employed professionals often use LAS as a temporary liquidity tool rather than a long-term borrowing solution.\n\nIf your income is uncertain, your shares are concentrated in a few stocks, or you are already uncomfortable with market volatility, LAS can amplify stress.\n\nIt is also a poor choice for long-term consumption spending. Using volatile assets to fund lifestyle expenses over many years increases the risk of forced liquidation.\n\nIf you cannot meet a margin call without selling the same shares you pledged, the structure is already too risky.\n\nA loan against shares is not inherently good or bad. It is a sharp financial tool that works well in specific situations and cuts badly in others.\n\nUsed thoughtfully, it can provide low-cost liquidity without derailing your investment journey. Used casually, it can push you into selling quality assets at the worst possible time.\n\nBefore taking one, ask yourself not just whether the interest rate is attractive, but whether you are prepared for what happens if markets move against you.",

There is no threat of higher inflation from higher-priced crude oil imports now.\n\nThe rupee underperformed in 2025. India runs a trade deficit in goods. Its net trade surplus in services and remittances is not enough to offset it. India depends on foreign capital flows to maintain a healthy balance of payments. When they run drier, rupee stability becomes a casualty, survey said.\n\nDomestic currency has been under pressure in the last few months, especially after the US imposed tariffs on India. Further it cam under pressure due to dumping of Indian equities by the foreign investors, delay in India-US trade deal, and rally in the Japanese bond yield.\n\nEven after this, the intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) remained limited to protect the currency from the sharp depreciation.\n\nThe local currency sanks to a new low of 92.0163 against the US dollar this morning.",

Infrastructure projects delivered healthy execution internationally, while domestic execution was impacted by headwinds in central-funded water projects. Energy projects continued to see strong execution; however, cost overruns in select hydrocarbon projects weighed on margins, which are expected to remain soft over the next 2-3 quarters. In Hi-tech manufacturing, an execution ramp-up in Precision Engineering drove growth, while L&T’s participation in the 87 MALE drone procurement program with its technology partner, General Atomics, further strengthens its growth prospects. Management remains optimistic, supported by an anticipated pickup in private capex, an improving share of private-sector opportunities (~35% of domestic infrastructure prospects), and expansion into new verticals such as data centers, semiconductors, and electrolyzers, while reiterating its ~15% YoY revenue growth guidance and ~8.5% P&M margins for FY26.\n\nWe maintain our ‘Buy’ rating valuing the core business at a PE of 22x Sep’27E (same as earlier) arriving at a SoTP-derived TP of Rs4,806 (Rs4,766 earlier).\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

GE Vernova T&D India (GVTD) reported a strong quarter with 58.4% YoY revenue growth and a 1000bps YoY improvement in EBITDA margin to 26.7%. On the back of sustained execution strength over the past few quarters, management has upgraded its FY26 EBITDA margin guidance to the higher end of mid-20s (mid20’s earlier). During the quarter, GVTD secured a VSC-HVDC order (Khavda– South Olpad), which is expected to be booked in subsequent quarters having a ~4-year execution timeline. Domestic order pipeline remains robust, led by TBCB opportunities generating across states, while export order in pipeline experienced a delay from the customer side now expected in H2FY27. Adequate existing capacity provides headroom to execute HVDC KhavdaSouth Olpad projects alongside potential new HVDC wins. Ongoing capex of ~Rs10bn through FY28 and effective raw-material pass-through mechanisms support operating leverage and margin resilience.\n\nWe believe 1) a healthy order pipeline in the power market, 2) a robust order book (Rs143.8bn), and 3) the management’s focus on margin improvement augur well for strong revenue & profit growth of GVTD. The stock is trading at a P/E of 51.7x/42.6x on FY27/28E. We maintain our ‘BUY’ rating with a revised TP of Rs4,050 (Rs4,005 earlier) valuing the stock at a PE of 65x Sep’27E (same as earlier).\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey said that India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has a big role in expanding the credit uptake among a new segment of users across smaller towns of the country.\n\nThe country's digital payments ecosystem closed 2025 on a record note, with UPI transactions hitting fresh highs in both value and volume in December, reinforcing the platform’s position as the country’s default retail payment rail.\n\n\"DPI payment interfaces, such as UPI, provide transaction data to assess creditworthiness,\" it said, adding that while the expansion of bank accounts is a necessary foundation, it is the effective use of those accounts that ultimately determines whether financial inclusion translates into meaningful\n\n\"A growing body of research shows that a public, interoperable payment infrastructure can play a catalytic role in this transition by converting basic access into active financial participation,\" the Economic Survey said.\n\nUPI is the world’s largest real-time payments system and processes over 21 billion transactions every month worth more than Rs 27 lakh crore, reflecting deep adoption across consumers and merchants. December 2025 turned into another milestone month, with UPI transaction volumes touching 21.6 billion, the highest ever recorded, surpassing 20.47 billion in November 2025.\n\nTransaction value rose to Rs 28 lakh crore, up from Rs 26.3 lakh crore a month earlier and above the previous peak of Rs 27.3 lakh crore seen in October 2025.\n\nThe Economic Survey said that UPI bridges the gap between account ownership and access to formal credit by generating verifiable transaction histories and sharply reducing transaction costs. It also noted the role of fintechs in enabling the credit uptake.\n\n\"Digital Public Infrastructure reshapes credit markets by enabling banks and fintechs to expand lending across the risk spectrum, with fintechs playing a distinctive role in reaching new-to-credit borrowers who were previously excluded from formal finance,\" the Survey said.\n\nRegions with affordable internet and widespread bank account penetration experienced the\n\nstrongest credit expansion, underscoring the layered nature of financial inclusion and the complementary roles of incumbents and new entrants.\n\nEconomic Survey also noted that the growth in credit linked to digital payments did not come at the cost of higher default rates, the richer transaction data allowed lenders to better identify\n\nunderserved but creditworthy borrowers.\n\n\"This evidence highlights the power of publicly provided, interoperable infrastructure to support inclusion at scale and to align technological change with macro-level financial development,\" it added.\n\nGrowth remains strong, but the pace moderates\n\nDespite a high base, growth momentum remained resilient through the year. Transaction volumes expanded 29.3 percent year-on-year in December 2025, while transaction value grew 20.3 percent, indicating that expansion is being driven more by deeper penetration and behavioural change than by rising ticket sizes.\n\nDecember marked the second instance in 2025 where volume growth slipped below 30 percent, suggesting a gradual normalisation in growth rates after several years of rapid expansion, albeit from a much higher base.\n\nA year of sharp scale-up for UPI\n\nOver the full year, UPI’s scale-up has been pronounced. Annual transaction volumes increased from 172.2 billion in 2024 to 228.3 billion in 2025, while transaction values rose from Rs 246.8 lakh crore to Rs 299.7 lakh crore, taking annual digital payments close to the Rs 300 lakh crore mark.\n\nThe platform is now embedded across grocery purchases, fuel payments, dining, local mobility, bill payments and a widening range of low-value merchant transactions.",

        "full_content": "IT shares declined up to 3 percent on Thursday after two sessions of gains, as investors booked profits across the sector. Stocks such as Persistent Systems, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCL Technologies led the losses amid selling pressure.\n\nThe Nifty IT index, which had risen 1.2 percent over the previous two sessions, gave up those gains and fell 1.5 percent in trade.\n\nKey factors behind the decline\n\n1) US Federal Reserve decision:The fall came after the US Federal Reserve held interest rates, in line with expectations, citing elevated inflation and resilient economic growth. Markets are not pricing in another rate cut until the June policy meeting. Higher US interest rates tend to support the dollar and Treasury yields, making emerging markets such as India relatively less attractive for foreign investors.\n\n\"The Fed decision is likely to lead to short-term challenges in US rate-sensitive sectors. Globally, this may lead to a slight market decline as investors adjust to the expectation of no immediate rate cuts,\" said Rajesh Palviya, Head of Research at Axis Securities.\n\nThe Indian IT sector, valued at about USD 283 billion, derives a significant portion of its revenue from the United States, making developments in the world’s largest economy critical for the industry.\n\n2) Profit booking:After the recent rally, profit booking was seen across IT stocks, leading the Nifty IT index to surrender all its gains from the past two sessions.\n\nShares ofTCSdeclined more than 2 percent, whilePersistent Systemsemerged as the biggest laggard, falling up to 3 percent. Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Infosys and HCL Technologies were down up to 1 percent. All ten constituents of the Nifty IT index were trading in the red.\n\n3) Weak US dollar:The US dollar extended its losses this week, slipping to a four-year low against a basket of currencies. A weaker dollar can weigh on Indian IT companies as it reduces the value of dollar-denominated revenues when converted into rupees, impacting earnings visibility for export-oriented firms.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Dumping of Indian equities by the foreign investors, delay in India-US trade deal and rally in the Japanese bond yield have added to the pressure.\n\nEven after this, the intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) remained limited to protect the currency from the sharp depreciation.\n\nThe survey said India’s inflation, headline and core, excluding precious metals, will likely be higher in FY27 than in FY26.\n\nIn December, the RBI revised its inflation projections for FY26 from 2.6 per cent to 2 percent, owing to a good kharif harvest and healthy rabi sowing. The IMF has projected an inflation rate of 2.8 percent in FY26 and 4 percent in FY27, the survey said.\n\nThe RBI’s forecast for headline Inflation for Q1 and Q2 of FY27 currently stands at 3.9 and 4 per cent, survey added.\n\nOn January 22, a Moneycontrol poll of 14 economists, bank treasury heads and fund managers on RBI policy expectation on rate action in February found that experts were divided on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation projections. Some experts said the central bank may remain in wait and watch mode before revising inflation forecast ahead of the new base year series for GDP and CPI.\n\nIndia’s inflation firmed up in December, rising to a three-month high of 1.33 percent from 0.7 percent in November, government data released on January 12 showed.\n\nEven with the uptick, headline inflation has now stayed below the RBI’s lower tolerance threshold of 2 percent for four consecutive months, underlining how price pressures have cooled meaningfully since the middle of the year.",

        "full_content": "India's external sector has remained strong owing to deepening global intergration , resilient services trade and expanding trade network, the Economic Survey for 2025-26 which was tabled in Parliament on January 29 said.\n\nThe government document released three days before the presentation of the Budget said India would needed a strong export-oriented policy to achieve strong export growth.\n\n\"A robust and stable currency can only be achieved through export competitiveness. History demonstrates that countries with sustained manufacturing export success are those that have maintained hard currency status, characterised by currency stability and strength,\" the survey noted.\n\nCAD stood at 1.3 percent of the GDP at the end of the September quarter. In FY25, current account deficit had narrowed to 0.6 percent.\n\n\"India’s external sector enters this phase of global fragmentation with strengthened buffers, diversified trade linkages and improving resilience. The policy challenge lies in leveraging these strengths to sustain external stability while supporting a high-growth trajectory in a world where global integration is increasingly shaped by strategic, rather than purely economic considerations,\" the survey highlighted.\n\nHowever, deficit is likely to remain contained this year with services exports making up for some of the slowdown in merchandise exports.\n\nIndia’s services exports at $304 billion in the first nine months of the year were nearly 7 percent higher compared to the previous year.\n\nUntil Q2, remittances were 10.7 percent higher compared with the previous year.\n\nUS tariffs are expected to keep the pressure on trade but India’s diversification play seems to have provided some relief. The country has finalised four trade agreements in the past year alone, having signed deals with the UK, New Zealand, Oman and the European Union.\n\nIts trade deal with European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which counts Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland as its members, came into force this year.\n\nAMoneycontrolanalysis shows that these deals will help cushion the impact of US tariffs once they take effect. Of the roughly $47 billion Indian exports facing 50 percent or more in US levies, nearly $40 billion , or 84 percent, can be absorbed by the EU alone.\n\nIndia exported $3.1 billion worth of precious metal jewellery to the US in 2024 but only $784 million to the EU. The bloc imported $17.2 billion worth of precious metal jewellery during the year, leaving a large untapped market.\n\nSimilarly, in seafood, India exported close to $1.9 billion worth of frozen shrimp to the US in 2024, while shipments to the EU were roughly a third of that value. Total EU imports of frozen shrimp stood at about $3.9 billion, suggesting room for India to scale up exports if tariff and non-tariff barriers are eased.",

Deflation in food prices persisted for seventh straight month, with the December reading at -2.71 percent.\n\n\"The trajectory of core inflation will need to be closely monitored in the context of monetary policy easing and potential upward pressures from global base metal prices,” the survey said, pointing to new CPI series having implications for inflation assessment and warranting careful interpretation of price dynamics.\n\nStarting February 12, the CPI series will shift to a new 2024 base, with an updated consumption basket that includes more items and assigns a higher weight to non-food components, which will also help contain food related volatility.\n\nCiting IMF data, the survey said inflation to average 2 percent this fiscal, may not exceed 4 percent coming fiscal as well.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India expects inflation to average 2 percent for FY26 and 4 percent in the first half of FY27.\n\nIn a Moneycontrol poll conducted in October, economists pegged FY27 inflation at around 4 percent as well.\n\nGST rate cuts have also started showing up in inflation.\n\nAn earlier analysis by Moneycontrol found that prices in consumer electronics and automobiles fell sharply between September and December, marking a far stronger pass-through than seen in recent years.\n\nAverage prices declined 3.6 percent over the September–December period. This is in contrast to the same months in 2024 and 2023, when prices in these categories barely moved, falling by just 0.3 percent on average.\n\nInflation has taken a backseat when it comes to perceptions as well.\n\nGlobal uncertainty has emerged as the single biggest concern for economists heading into the FY27 Budget, overtaking domestic inflation and fiscal risks, according to a pre-Budget poll of 20 economists.\n\nWhen asked about their primary concern for the economy, six respondents cited US and global headwinds, making it the most frequently flagged risk. These include trade protectionism, slowing global growth, and heightened geopolitical tensions.\n\nCXOs seem less concerned about inflation as well.\n\nOver half of the respondents were confident in policymakers controlling inflation below the RBI’s target rate of 4 percent, which also contributed to brighter outlook for cost of capital.\n\nOver two-thirds of respondents expected the central bank to cut rates in FY27.\n\nThe RBI has cut rates by 125 basis points since the start of 2025, bringing the policy rate to 5.25 percent.\n\nEconomists have pencilled in another rate cut in the February meeting following the Budget announcement.",

Taking these considerations together, the Economic Survey projects real GDP growth in FY27 in the range of 6.8 to 7.2 per cent,” the Economic Survey noted.\n\nThe government’s estimate is higher than the International Monetary Fund’s forecast of 6.4 percent and World Bank’s projection of 6.5 percent growth.\n\nThe Economic Survey this time has been released two days before the presentation of the Union Budget where all eyes will be on the finance minister to continue the growth momentum and attract private capex.\n\nThe Indian economy will likely grow 7.4 percent in 2025-26, according to the first advance estimates released by the government earlier this month.\n\nReal GDP growth rose to 8 percent in the first half of the year, with the economy logging 7.8 percent growth in the first quarter and 8.2 percent in the second quarter of the year.\n\nWhile the RBI projects 7.3 percent growth for this fiscal, with 7 percent projection for Q3 and 6.5 percent for Q4, economy could still surprise on the upside.\n\nMoneycontrol’s Eco Pulse, a real-time tracker of economic momentum, indicated a steady momentum in December with a value of 53.7 helped by stronger industrial activity and robust rural demand. A reading of above 50 indicates stronger than average growth, while below 50 reading signals moderation.\n\nThe recovery in FY26 was driven largely by investment and manufacturing. Investment emerged as a key growth engine, expanding 7.8 percent compared with 7.1 percent in previous year.\n\nEconomists in a Moneycontrol survey were hopeful of the economy hitting 10.1 percent nominal growth in FY27, while over 70 percent respondents to a Moneycontrol CXO poll highlighted optimism about economy growing over 6.5 percent plus in FY27.\n\nNearly one in five respondents in the pre-Budget survey expect India’s economy to grow above 7 percent in FY27, a sharp improvement from last year when only a small fraction of corporate leaders were extremely optimistic about growth. The share of pessimistic respondents also dropped sharply. Only 6.5 percent of CXOs now expect growth to slip below 6 percent, compared with 15.6 percent in the previous year’s survey, pointing to improving confidence in the domestic macroeconomic environment.",

        "full_content": "Wondering if you can save on capital gains if you invest ancestral house sale proceeds in bonds and property? Today’s Ask Wallet Wise explains how the exemption works under sections 54 and 54EC.\n\nMy grandmother purchased a residential house property in 1956. It was bequeathed to me and I have mutated it in my name in 2024. If I sell it now, can I invest the entire proceeds in bonds and property to save capital gains?\n\nExpert’s Advice: Though there is no cost of assets received as a gift from specified relatives or as inheritance, either under a will or under personal law, the cost for the purpose of computing the capital gain is taken to be the cost for which the same was purchased by the last owner who had paid for it.\n\nFor capital assets acquired before April 1, 2001, the fair market value on that date can be taken as the cost for the computation of capital gains. As the house acquired in 1956 was received by you as an inheritance, you can opt to take the fair market value on April 1, 2001, as your cost for computing the capital gains. Likewise, the holding period for determining whether the capital asset has become a long-term asset or not is also counted from the date on which the same was acquired by the last owner who had paid for it.\n\nSince the holding period of the residential house is more than two years, the difference between the sale price and the fair market value (as discussed above) will be taxed as long-term capital gains in your hands. To save tax on such long-term capital gains, you have two options, which can be used singularly or in combination. Please note that under both options, you have to invest only the long-term capital gains and not the entire sale proceeds.\n\nThe first option is available under Section 54, where you invest the unindexed long-term capital gains for the purchase or construction of another residential house in India within the prescribed time period.\n\nFor buying a ready-to-move-in house, the investment has to be made within two years from the date of sale of the existing house. Even if you buy a residential house within a year before the date of sale of the existing residential house, exemption under Section 54 can be claimed.  For self-construction or booking an under-construction house, a longer period of three years is available from the date of sale of the house, within which the construction of the house needs to be completed and possession obtained.\n\nThe amount which is not utilised for the purchase or construction of the house by the due date of filing your income tax return is required to be deposited in a bank account under the Capital Gains Account Scheme. The deposited money has to be used within the time prescribed for the purpose of buying or constructing the residential house.\n\nThe second option is under Section 54EC. You have to invest the long-term capital gains in Capital Gain Bonds of a specified financial institution within six months from the date of sale of the existing house.  A maximum of Rs 50 lakhs can be invested in these bonds in one financial year, as well as for claiming exemption in respect of a single year.",

The broader crypto market slipped after the US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at 3.5 percent–3.75 percent, wiping $2.9 trillion off the market.\n\n\"The drop was led by bitcoin’s falling below $88,000 amid low liquidity and cautious sentiment. The cryptocurrency, however, stayed rangebound between $86,000–$91,000, with open interest concentrated near $90,000 ahead of Friday’s options expiry. For now, crypto markets appear locked in consolidation-active, but waiting for a decisive macro or technical catalyst,\" said Riya Sehgal, Research Analyst, Delta Exchange.\n\nCoinSwitch Markets desk said, \"From a technical perspective, $90K remains key resistance, with a sustained break required to unlock upside toward $91K–$92K, while $89K continues to act as strong near-term support, where buyers have repeatedly stepped in.\"\n\nEthereum was down 1.95 percent, Tehter 0.03 percent, XRP 1.67 percent, Solana 3.16 percent, Dogecoin 2.20 percent, and Cardano 2.04 percent.

Gold continues to mark new highs, which has negatively impacted the crypto markets as the liquidity appears to have rotated into traditional assets,\" said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\nAccording to Avinash Shekhar, Co-Founder & CEO, Pi42, bitcoin’s inability to sustain a move above $90,000 is more indicative of short-term hesitation than structural weakness. \"The fact that bitcoin is hovering near key technical zones with clearly defined liquidation thresholds shows that participants are positioning carefully around upcoming catalysts rather than exiting aggressively,\" he said.\n\n\"Derivatives data suggest positioning has tightened, keeping volatility contained for now. As macro clarity improves and liquidity conditions normalise,\" Shekhar said. Bitcoin’s ability to defend the range should support the next leg of the move toward higher levels, including the $95,000.\n\nWhat’s happening in the crypto market?\n\nHere’s a rundown of the crypto market according to WazirX founder Nischal Shetty and CoinDCX research team:",

        "full_content": "Harmonising the rules under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act has emerged as a significant issue for rural housing finance ahead of Budget 2026.\n\nLenders say inconsistent enforcement across states slows loan recovery, raises risks and makes banks hesitant to lend in villages and small towns. For borrowers, this often results in fewer options, higher interest rates and long delays in approving homeloans.\n\n“We recommend budgetary measures for more credit supply to the rural and lower middle-income segments in India. To achieve this, the Union Budget 2026 can include measures for liberalising branch-opening norms for gold loan NBFCs to accelerate outreach and deepen market penetration, especially for secured gold loans which carry relatively lower risk,” Muthoot FinCorp Ltd CEO Shaji Varghese said.\n\nRationalising capital risk weights for gold loans by NBFCs can lower lending costs and promote increased credit flow to rural and semi-urban markets.\n\nHarmonising SARFAESI Act applicability for NBFCs in line with banks and housing finance companies (HFCs) will help drive rural housing credit and strengthen recovery mechanisms for smaller-ticket mortgage loans, Varghese said.\n\nIt should also offer targeted schemes to ensure customers who experienced temporary or one-time credit default are not permanently excluded from formal banking channels . The Budget should also promote formalisation of gold lending by encouraging policy reforms that shift activity from informal channels to regulated institutions and strengthen consumer protection, he said.\n\nThe SARFAESI Act authorises banks and financial institutions to recover non-performing assets (NPAs) without the intervention of courts. It enables lenders to seize, manage and auction secured properties, residential and commercial, to recover loans if a borrower defaults, typically after a 60-day notice period.\n\n\"The Union Budget 2026 can play a meaningful role by deepening domestic liquidity and strengthening risk-sharing frameworks such as credit guarantees and co-lending structures. These measures can help lower borrowing costs, support longer and more predictable tenures, and create repayment structures that offer greater certainty to borrowers,\" Godrej Capital MD & CEO Manish Shah said.\n\nEncouraging stable long-term savings and recognising high levels of tax compliance can further strengthen the funding base of the financial system and reinforce trust in formal participation. \"The objective is not just to build a larger financial ecosystem, but a more resilient and efficient one, where capital flows productively, risk is shared responsibly and finance supports India’s next phase of inclusive and sustainable growth,” Shah said.\n\nAs the government looks for ways to promote affordable housing and increase formal credit in rural areas, experts say clearer and standardised SARFAESI rules can enable lending opportunities. A more predictable recovery process will encourage banks to explore deeper into the countryside, where housing demand is growing but access to finance remains limited, they say.",

        "full_content": "Silver has stolen the spotlight in the commodities world, driven by strong industrial demand, global economic uncertainty and surging prices.\n\nLike gold, silver is increasingly seen not just as a hedge against inflation and currency volatility but as a strategic asset class in diversified portfolios. Data from Ace MF shows Indian silver exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reported spectacular gains with one-year returns of more than 270  percent and three-year gains near 70 percent across most funds underscoring bullion’s powerful move.\n\nThe silver ETF ecosystem has grown rapidly, attracting inflows as investors seek regulated, liquid exposure to rising prices without the hassles of owning physical metal. A wide array of ETFs now lets you participate in silver’s upside via your demat account with transparency and cost efficiency.\n\nTop silver ETFs by performance and size\n\nAccording to the latest AUM and performance data, Nippon India Silver ETF leads the pack with assets of nearly Rs 28,944-crore and a one-year return of 272 percent . ICICI Prudential Silver ETF follows with Rs 14,828-crore AUM and a 274 percent gain over one year.\n\nOther large funds such as HDFC Silver ETF, SBI Silver ETF and Kotak Silver ETF also delivered robust results, with one-year returns clustering around the 270-plus mark. Notably, Tata Silver ETF reported the highest year-to-date absolute performance at 708 percent , reflecting heightened momentum in silver prices. Lesser-sized offerings from DSP, Axis and UTI also posted similar stellar gains, illustrating how silver’s rally has lifted nearly the entire ETF category.\n\nWhy silver ETFs are gaining traction\n\nSilver’s dual identity as both a precious and industrial metal has boosted its appeal. Strong demand from solar panel manufacturing, electronics and other tech sectors, coupled with safe-haven buying during uncertain times, has underpinned prices.\n\nUnlike physical silver, ETFs eliminate concerns about storage, purity and safety, and can be traded like stocks on exchanges. This ease of access has helped propel total AUM in combined gold and silver ETFs beyond ₹1 lakh crore, establishing them as mainstream investment vehicles.\n\nAccording to market watchers, the expanding investor base for precious metal ETFs signals a shift toward passive, regulated instruments that offer transparency along with bullion exposure.\n\nSilver ETF Taxation: What investors should know\n\nTaxation can materially affect net returns from silver ETFs. In India, silver ETFs are treated as listed securities for tax purposes. If held for more than 12 months, gains qualify as long-term capital gains and are taxed at a flat 12.5 percent on the amount exceeding the basic exemption, without indexation benefits. Selling within 12 months triggers short-term capital gains, which are taxed at the investor’s slab rate.\n\nFor comparison, physical silver typically attracts long-term capital gains tax at 20 percent with indexation if held for over three years, though digital silver and ETFs streamline holding periods and tax treatment.\n\nSilver ETFs have been standout performers, reflecting strong price action and investor enthusiasm in 2025–26. They offer a cost-efficient, liquid way to access silver’s upside without physical handling. However, like all commodity-linked assets, they can be volatile and are best used as part of a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk appetite and investment horizon. The commodity exposure should be 10-15 percent of your portfolio.",

        "full_content": "Gold blistered past the $5,500 an ounce mark for the first time on January 29, supported by the US Federal Reserve's decision to leave rates unchanged and simmering geopolitical and trade tensions. After touching an all-time high of $5,584 in the international market, the yellow metal was hovering around $5,519, up 4.06 percent from the previous close.\n\nOn MCX, the metal on Thursday surged at an all-time high of Rs 1,92,991 per 10 grams of 24 carat purity, representing a 8.94 percent gain from its previous close at Rs 1,77,153. The metal previously peaked at Rs 1,77,996 on January 28, 2026.\n\nGold prices vary by purity. Check the prices of gold based on its purity:\n\nCity-wise gold prices in India today\n\nGold rates across India’s major cities showed remarkable uniformity, with only marginal differences due to local taxes, jeweller margins, and logistics costs.\n\nPolicy uncertainty around growth, trade, and fiscal sustainability tends to pressure the USD, increasing volatility expectations. If this environment continues, gold and silver benefit as a softer or range-bound USD would support precious metals. Also, heightened uncertainty boosts safe-haven demand as investors seek assets less exposed to policy error or fiscal strain.\n\n\"The January FED meeting held the base rate as largely expected, with Chair Powell striking a balanced but cautious tone. He acknowledged that the labour market is becoming more stable, but job growth is slowing as labour force participation declines and demand softens, with some of this being linked to AI in the near-term,\" Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead at VT Markets.\n\nInflation remains above target but is broadly in line with expectations. At the same time, incoming data points to clearly stronger growth and a better overall outlook, giving the FED confidence to stay patient rather than trying to pre-empt.\n\nPowell again continued to stress that policy will remain firmly data-driven. With risks to both inflation and employment having diminished and expectations in line, Powell said ‘’rate hikes are not anyone’s base case’’. Further cuts would be warranted if the labour market weakens, if labour risks re-emerge, or if tariff-related price pressures fade. He also warned that the US budget deficit is unsustainable, underscoring longer-term fiscal risks that complicate the policy backdrop.\n\n\"Globally, this dynamic can loosen financial conditions outside the US, supporting emerging market assets and commodities, while keeping risk sentiment fragile. Equities may grind higher, but with higher cross-asset volatility as markets adjust to a Fed that is increasingly sensitive to downside risks,\" Maxwell said.\n\nOutlook: Will gold continue its momentum?\n\n\"Gold traded strongly positive with gains... on MCX.  Ongoing tariff uncertainty from the US and continued allocation into safe-haven assets have further supported the rally. However, after such a sharp and extended upmove, gold is entering an overheated zone where volatility can increase,\" said Jateen Trivedi, VP research analyst, commodity and currency, LKP Securities.\n\nThe US central bank kept the policy rate unchanged after Fed policymakers voted 10-2 to hold the central bank's benchmark interest rate in the 3.50-3.75 percent range. The US unemployment rate in December stood at 4.4 percent. The yield on the 10-year Treasury is up at 4.25 percent, and the two-year Treasury yield is at around 3.57 percent.\n\nGold also surged amid ongoing tension between the US and Iran and the crises in Ukraine and Gaza. US President Donald Trump's 100 percent tariff threat against Canada if it strikes a trade deal with China and warning of a 25 levy against South Korea have intensified the safe-haven demand in bullion.",

The document is likely to build on last year’s narrative of steady expansion, while updating the government’s short-term gross domestic product (GDP) outlook in light of stronger-than-expected momentum through 2025.\n\nThe Survey is expected to set out its outlook on growth and employment, with a sharper focus on productivity gains, private capital expenditure and the role of digital technologies – particularly artificial intelligence – in reshaping labour markets and skill requirements.\n\nLast year’s Economic Survey (2024–25) made the case for medium-term structural reforms and projected real GDP growth for FY2025–26 in the range of 6.3 percent to 6.8 percent. The upcoming Survey is expected to review actual economic outturns since then and explain any recalibration of the near-term growth assessment.\n\n2025 signals: Upside to growth\n\nThrough 2025, Chief Economic Adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran repeatedly pointed to the possibility of a stronger growth outcome than earlier estimates, particularly after robust quarterly GDP prints in the second quarter of the fiscal. He indicated that FY2025–26 growth could be “north of 7 percent” and flagged the prospect of India approaching the USD four-trillion economy milestone, citing sustained momentum in manufacturing and services.\n\nGrowth and the numbers:The Survey is expected to lead with a data-driven assessment comparing last year’s projection band of 6.3–6.8 percent with the latest growth indicators. While maintaining a cautious tone, it may reflect an upward bias to the outlook, taking into account recent momentum.\n\nExports amid geopolitical risks:Exports are likely to feature as a key area of concern amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty, supply-chain disruptions and uneven global demand. Last year’s Survey noted that India’s exports of goods and services remained resilient despite global headwinds, but warned that trade is sensitive to conflicts, protectionism and volatility in energy and freight costs. The new Survey is expected to revisit these risks, assess pressures on merchandise exports and highlight the role of services exports, market diversification and free trade agreements in cushioning external shocks.\n\nInvestment and supply-side push:Private capital expenditure and foreign direct investment may be highlighted as central drivers of expansion, alongside policy prescriptions to sustain the investment cycle and ease bottlenecks.\n\nLabour, technology and AI:Building on last year’s special essay on artificial intelligence and employment, the Survey is expected to deepen its analysis of how automation and generative AI are altering labour demand, productivity and skill formation.\n\nClimate and green transition:The document may revisit social indicators and green investment priorities to present a balanced view of growth.\n\nFor markets and ratings agencies, the Economic Survey serves as a comprehensive stock-taking exercise that frames the Union Budget. Any upward shift in the official growth narrative – including an acknowledgement that growth may exceed the earlier 6.8 percent ceiling – will shape expectations around fiscal arithmetic, policy priorities and the broader economic outlook.",

But its domestic auto industry has been among the world's most protected, with the government levying tariffs of between 70% and 110% on imported cars.\n\nPRICIEST EUROPEAN CARS BENEFIT FROM BIGGEST DUTY CUTS\n\nWhile India agreed under the deal to reduce import tariffs on cars above an import price of 15,000 euros ($17,963) to 10% over time, details of how the reductions will be implemented were not disclosed publicly.\n\nA senior Indian government official, however, said New Delhi agreed to immediately reduce import duties on 100,000 traditional internal combustion engine cars annually split between three price categories.\n\nEuropean cars with an import price of 15,000 euros to 35,000 euros will see tariffs reduced to 35%, with annual imports capped at 34,000 units, said the official, who asked not to be named as the deal still requires legal vetting.\n\nCars priced 35,000 euros to 50,000 euros will be charged a 30% duty, with imports limited to 33,000 units a year, the official said. And 33,000 cars priced over 50,000 euros will also be subject to a reduced tariff of 30%.\n\nThe two highest price categories will see the largest tariff reductions. And the cap for all three categories combined will be raised to 160,000 units over 10 years, the official said.\n\nIndia's trade ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the details of the agreement.\n\nMORE INDIANS DEVELOPING A TASTE FOR LUXURY\n\nAt a time when a growing number of Indians are developing a taste for opulence - from expensive homes to watches and even bathroom fittings - luxury cars made up less than 1% of the 4.4 million passenger vehicles sold in the country last year.\n\nWhile executives have said that lower tariffs are unlikely to translate into immediate price cuts, they said the reductions will allow them to bring more vehicles to the market.\n\nLower import taxes should also be a boost for other European automakers such as Volkswagen, Renault and Stellantis, which have said increased trade will also result in increased technology transfer and shared supply chains.\n\nLOCAL EV MANUFACTURERS TO REMAIN PROTECTED FOR NOW\n\nIndia will, meanwhile, also cut import duties to 30% to 35% on a total of 20,000 European-made electric vehicles, the official said, but only five years after the trade deal is implemented.\n\nThose tariff cuts will only apply to EVs priced above 20,000 euros in order to protect domestic players like Tata Motors and Mahindra.\n\nSimilar to combustion engines, the duty on EVs will reduce to 10% over five years and the annual import quota will rise to 90,000 units, the official added.",

Pet owners, especially those buying imported dog food, could also see prices ease as tariffs are lowered under the pact.\n\nPremium European brands such as Farmina and Royal Canin are likely to become more affordable once duties are reduced, potentially expanding their footprint in a market where imports are still dominated by Asian suppliers. Currently, the EU accounts for less than 10 percent of India’s pet food market, underscoring the headroom for growth once price barriers come down.\n\nCommerce ministry data show that Thailand has steadily strengthened its dominance in India’s dog and cat food imports, accounting for more than 62 percent of imports in FY25, up from 39 percent in FY18. South Africa and China are other notable suppliers, while the EU’s share has declined sharply over the years, from more than 50 percent in FY18 to about 19.5 percent in FY25. Within Europe, France, Italy and Spain remain the largest suppliers, though their individual shares are well below their earlier peaks.\n\nDespite the EU’s shrinking import share, India’s overall pet food imports have surged as rising incomes, urbanisation, and changing lifestyles fuel pet ownership. Imports of dog and cat food have more than doubled over the past five years and risen sixfold over the past decade, the data show.\n\nIndia imported $72.19 million worth of dog and cat food in the eleven months of 2025, compared with $35.05 million during between January and November 2018. A decade ago, imports during the same period stood at just $11.2 million.\n\nIf tariff reductions under the EU trade deal translate into lower retail prices, European brands could regain market share lost to Asian competitors, while Indian consumers benefit from a wider choice and more competitive pricing in an increasingly crowded pet care market.",

        "full_content": "The Central government will stick to its goal of 4.4 percent fiscal deficit as there is no room for further easing, said professor Mahendra Dev, the chairman of the PM-Economic Affairs Council. However, the government now needs to target its debt-to-GDP ratio, which currently stands at 56.1 percent, he said in an interview.\n\nIn addition, the top economist said the recently concluded India-EU free trade deal will help soften blow from external factors, as New Delhi seeks to cut trade dependence on few countries. The professor also expressed confidence that India will grow at 6.5-7 percent in FY27.\n\nYou have described India EU-FTA as transformative. What are the implications short-term and long-term implications?\n\nThe India-EU FTA is being called as the mother of all deals because 2 billion people and 27 to 28 countries are involved. So, it's a great opportunity for both sides. India will benefit with exports in many labour-intensive commodities like textiles, gems and jewelry and auto parts.\n\nAnd similarly, Europe will benefit from their exports of many commodities to India, including wines and luxury cars. So, it's mutually beneficial for both and part of diversifying exports to other countries. India has sealed several trade deals in the last two years or so. So, I think India is trying to diversify, avoiding dependence on few countries. That’s the strategy.\n\nDoes the India-EU FTA cushion us comfortably against other external pains?\n\nYes, most of it. Of course, in the short term, there may be some problems. For example, textiles and others sectors may get affected. But I think in the next one or two years, we can have more diversified exports. So, in that way, India's growth is not affected due to US tariffs.\n\nSo, what kind of policy interventions will enable our businesses to deal with those regulatory hurdles, especially with CBAM?\n\nAs the finance minister, commerce minister mentioned, it is for all the countries. So, I think that can be probably negotiated. Then we have to be more technology-oriented where carbon emissions can be reduced.\n\nFrom a policy perspective, do you think there is room for more support to MSMEs for easier tech access?\n\nI think the government is already taking a lot of measures for MSMEs. There are three main problems for MSMEs. One is credit, the working capital, particularly, and then technology, they have to adopt technology. And third is marketing. I think government facilitates some of these things. And then, of course, large corporate sector also has to help the MSMEs.\n\nYou have said a weakening rupee is not a structural issue. What can the budget do to address the capital outflows?\n\nWeakening rupee has an impact on imports, particularly because we also import some of the commodities for export purposes, so that cost will increase. But on the other hand, why I said it's a cyclical, not a structural one problem is because it has happened in the last one year or so. One of the issues is that there is uncertainty on the US-India trade deal. So, once I think it's done, that problem will not be there and that's why I said it's a cyclical. Because if you see over time, India's rupee compared to, if you see last five years, the depreciation is not that high. It's only this year that the currency has slipped 6% or so. So, that's why I said it's maybe a question of one year or two years kind of thing. I think the people will come to India. And investments in AI may reduce after some time. So, people will come to India.\n\nWhat do you think are the reasons for the private sector not stepping up investments?\n\nYou need to have growth rate of seven to 8% for that. Right now, we have investment rate of about 30 percent and we need to increase it to around 35 percent. The government has been raising capital expenditure in the last few years to help the private sector. India has been adopting several measures such as GST, ease of compliances and several other steps. This will push the private sector to invest more. Some of the industries said uncertainty is one of the reasons. However, it's the right time to invest because the balance sheets are very good, corporate balance sheets and bank balance sheets, the so called twin balance sheet problem is not there. So, I think this is the right time to invest. But some of the CMIE data shows that there some investments are already happening. So that way, I'm hopeful in the next few years, with these reforms and the government capital expenditure will have multiplier effects on private investment.\n\nIs there a case in the Budget to perhaps look at encouraging consumption through other ways and through other methods?\n\nNo, government has already done some of the reforms through GST and income tax that will increase the consumption and similarly, monetary policy also has done reduction in interest rates. So, all those things will lead to consumption pick up in the next six months.\n\nCan you give your perspective on India's declining debt trajectory. Do you think there's room right now for fiscal easing, or should India stick to its fiscal consolidation?\n\nI think, for fiscal easing there is no room. The government will stick to the goals of 4.4 percent fiscal deficit, although it's not a goal. Now, debt-to-GDP is the goal, which is 56.1 percent for this year. For the next financial year, we have to go to 55 percent, that’s how it will be 50 percent (by FY31). That’s the goal, and the government will achieve it.\n\nIt’s often said that India needs to grow between 7-8 percent, then only we see a cycle change in per capita income…\n\nPer capita income, generally they say, is between Rs 2,500-3,000. For it to double, about Rs 5,000-5,500 or so. I think generally it takes six years to double the per capita income. But in long term, we need to have 7-8 percent growth, and that depends on several sources of growth.\n\nOne is, you know, human capital, skills, education, health, that's the one which we need to focus. Second, is labour intensive manufacturing sector. And third is women participation in workforce. The rates are lower now about 35 percent, world average is 50 percent.\n\nAlso, the structural transformation from agriculture to manufacturing and services is needed. Because India has 46 percent of working population in agriculture, which is 15 percent of GDP. So that unless we shift the workers to manufacturing and services with skills, education and other things, then we can't achieve higher growth.\n\nWe have been missing our divestment targets? Do you think the government has dropped the idea?\n\nI don't think the government has dropped something because they're trying. I think the government is probably trying to divest IDBI Bank. But the government is waiting for the right time…because the markets and all also have to be, suitable for disinvestment. So probably over time, I think they will try to achieve the targets.\n\nYou wrote a piece on PSU IPOs, can you tell us what’s driving the optimism behind?\n\nEarlier, one or two decades back, PSUs faced a lot of losses and Budget had to give protection to them. But now PSUs are having profits. Some may be problematic, but even PSU banks are doing well. So, because of the efficiency improvement in both public enterprises and banks, the people have changed their perception.\n\nBharat Coking Coal went for IPO. I think, it was subscribed 147 times. And similarly, several other public sector enterprises in recent years have got a lot of subscriptions for IPOs. So, I think lot of efficiency improvement has happened in the sector.\n\nWhen we look at, where we are from an economic point of view -- the weakening rupee, you said, is not a structural issue, but a lot of people are hurting. So, in this, how does an average Indian feel optimistic about when it comes to the economy, and what is driving your optimism?\n\nAs I mentioned, the weakening of the rupee is maybe a concern at individual level, sending people abroad or those things…but from the economy point of view, I don't think one should worry because our inflation is low. When the rupee deficits, inflation increases generally. So that is not a worry.\n\nAnd then our growth is also good. So that way, from the macro-economic point of view, it's not a problem. That's why I said it's a cyclical, individual level. Of course, one benefits on loses in this kind of thing on the ease of living.\n\nIf you see the structural reforms in the last 10 years, I think a lot of things have been done, including IBC and then RERA. So, that has improved certain things. But as I kept on saying, states are also important in this journey. They also have to participate at the ground level, efficiency improvement in this. So, my sense why I'm optimistic about India, because the growth rate is higher, and then we have lot of focus.\n\nWe are also paying attention to health, education skills now, which will improve. And then our demographic dividend, which we will have. Because for all the countries, aging is a problem. They're becoming, you know, above 40-50, whereas we still have our median age at 29.",

The proposed duty rates will vary by vehicle price: 35 percent for those priced €20,000–€40,000, 30 percent for €40,000–€60,000, and 30 percent for vehicles above €60,000, sources said.\n\nWhile, the specific quotas for EVs during the entire period were not disclosed, the quota for the first eligible year will be capped at 20,000 units.\n\nAfter five more years, the duty rate is expected to drop to 10 percent, while the quota of EVs eligible for tariff concessions will gradually rise to 90,000 units by the 14th year of the agreement.\n\nTherefore the tariff cut on cars, across all segments, will come with a quota of 250,000 vehicles a year.\n\nCars priced below €15,000 have been excluded from the deal, with the threshold applying across internal combustion engine, electric and hybrid vehicles.\n\nOnly cars priced above €15,000 will be granted tariff concessions, and these have been divided into three segments, each subject to a separate import quota.\n\nCurrently, the import duty levied by India on completely built-up (CBU) passenger vehicles is 110 percent for cars costing over $40,000, and 70 percent for cars costing up to $40,000.\n\nIndia and the 27-nation European Union concluded talks for a free trade agreement on January 27 granting greater market access to both sides once the deal kicks in.",

        "full_content": "It’s one of the most common UPI mistakes, and one of the most stressful. You make a payment, see the success message, and only then realise the money has gone to the wrong UPI ID. The amount may not even be large, but the fear is immediate because UPI moves fast and gives you no obvious way to pull money back.\n\nWhat happens next is far less dramatic than people assume, and often far less reassuring.\n\nWhy a successful UPI payment is hard to undo\n\nUPI transfers are built to be instant and final. Once a transaction shows as successful, the money has already moved from your bank account into someone else’s. Unlike card payments or failed bank transfers, there is no cooling-off window and no automatic reversal. This is the part many users find hard to accept. Even though the payment was a mistake, the bank cannot simply take the money back. Legally and technically, it now sits in the recipient’s account, and any reversal depends on their consent. That design choice is deliberate. UPI prioritises speed and certainty over reversibility. The trade-off is that the responsibility to verify details sits squarely with the sender.\n\nWhat the bank and the app actually do\n\nThe first thing you should do is raise a complaint within the UPI app you used. Every transaction has a dispute or “wrong transfer” option. This doesn’t reverse the money, but it creates a formal trail and triggers communication between banks. Your bank then reaches out to the recipient’s bank, which in turn informs the account holder that money has been credited by mistake and asks whether they are willing to return it. If the recipient agrees, the reversal is processed and the money usually comes back within a few working days.\n\nIf the recipient ignores the request or refuses, the bank’s role becomes limited. Banks cannot\n\ndebit an account without authorisation, even when the credit was accidental. At this point, you may be advised to submit a written complaint or, in some cases, approach the police. That step can help establish pressure, but it does not guarantee recovery.\n\nWhen the money comes back automatically\n\nThere is one situation where users often get lucky. If the UPI ID you entered does not exist at all, the transaction usually fails and the money is automatically returned to your account within a short time. This is why checking whether the transaction was marked “successful” or “failed” matters so much.\n\nOnce it’s successful, however, the outcome depends entirely on the person at the other end.\n\nWhy speed helps, but doesn’t solve everything\n\nRaising a complaint quickly is still important. It increases the chance of contacting the recipient before the money is spent and signals that the transfer was genuinely accidental. But speed does not change the underlying rule. There is no deadline within which banks can force a reversal.\n\nThis is also why UPI fraud cases are harder to resolve than people expect. If money is sent voluntarily, even under deception, recovery is not automatic. Accounts can be flagged or frozen if fraud is proven, but that does not always translate into money coming back.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth about UPI mistakes\n\nThe reason wrong UPI transfers feel so harsh is because the system works so well when things go right. Instant payments leave very little room for human error. The brief moment when the recipient’s name flashes on the screen before you hit confirm is not a formality. It is the only real safeguard you have.\n\nUPI assumes attentiveness, not forgiveness. Once you understand that, the rules make more sense, even if they feel unforgiving.\n\nCan my bank reverse a wrong UPI transfer on its own?\n\nNo. If the transaction is successful, the bank cannot debit the recipient’s account without\n\ntheir consent or a legal order.\n\nHow long does it take to get the money back if the recipient agrees?\n\nUsually a few working days, depending on the banks involved and how quickly the recipient\n\nWhat if the recipient refuses to return the money?\n\nYou can escalate the complaint and, if advised, approach the police, but recovery is not",

        "full_content": "India and European Union (EU) together comprise of 2 billion people, 25% of global GDP and one third of global trade. A free trade deal (FTA) between the two countries marks a giant step for the global economy. While the trade discussions have been happening for nearly two decades, more intense discussions started from 2022 and concluded on January 27, 2026.\n\nGiven the status of India-US trade deal, the India-EU FTA is symbolic in terms of India being able to find other markets for most of the goods that are exported to the US. It should also be viewed considering the global supply chain restructuring initiatives to reduce dependency on China. The deal will put the US on the backfoot and show cases that India will not compromise on access to agriculture and dairy because of the large farmer population which depends on these sectors. Taken positively it shows that India is willing to give access to higher-end products, such as wines, or niche agricultural products, such as kiwis etc. This might be a template along which the India-US trade deal can happen.\n\nAccording to the EU perspective, 96% of goods exported by the EU are going to have reduced or zero tariffs, while the Indian perspective is that 99% of Indian exports will have privileged access.\n\nSeveral Indian sectors are likely to benefit from the FTA. EU imports around $100 billion worth of footwear and leather goods. Currently, India exports around $2.4 billion to the EU in this category. The tariffs will be reduced to zero, from as high as 17%, immediately once the deal is in force. This should support Indian companies gaining larger market share over time. Another sector is marine products (tariffs of upto 26% to be reduced) which opens a market of $53 billion with a current export value of just $1 billion. Gems and jewelry sector currently at $2.7 billion exports to EU will be able to target the $79 billion imports market in the EU.\n\nApparel and textiles is a sector where India could see zero tariffs and access to a $263 billion EU imports market. Currently, India exports $7 billion to the EU. This could be a significant boost to Indian manufacturers in this sector. Plastics and rubber are another EU imports market worth $317 billion of which India currently has a share of only $2.4 billion. Chemicals is another sector worth $500 billion EU imports market where India gets privileged access.\n\nMedical devices including spectacles, lenses and measuring and testing equipment could find a large market. Similarly, engineering goods get access to a $2 trillion market of which current share is only $16. 6 billion.\n\nOn the services side, the IT/ITes, professional services, educational services and R&D and other knowledge-based services will get a boost with predictable visa frameworks to support business development and delivery in the EU. This will also support Indian students to continue post-study work in the EU.\n\nTraditional medicine including Ayurveda is also going to find a large market.\n\nFrom an investment perspective, one should not get too excited and act in haste. There is no reason to start investing in any of these sectors without proper analysis. Of course, the market leaders in these sectors are likely to get the maximum benefit from the privileged market access. One needs to estimate how much gains each company has in terms of revenues from this over the next 3-5 years. This needs to be incorporated in the valuation models and then the revised intrinsic value needs to be compared to the current market prices. Only if the market price is significantly lower than the intrinsic value would it make sense to invest in those companies.\n\nWhat one can definitely focus on is being aware of the sectors or growth vectors which are likely to benefit given the above FTA details. For example, Services and Industries are two growth vectors which get a significant boost from this. A portfolio approach to this growth vector which focuses on the full universe of Services companies and at any given time invests in a select set of companies which are significantly mispriced given the growth opportunity is likely to deliver satisfactory returns over the long-term as the FTA benefits unfold. Similarly, the Industries growth vector would benefit from the access to engineering markets.\n\nWe would suggest a disciplined approach to companies in these sectors following the Scientific Investing Framework as opposed to a knee-jerk reaction to ad-hoc stocks which are touted as beneficiaries of the FTA.",

        "full_content": "The recent conclusion of negotiations on the long-pending India-European Union Free Trade Agreement (FTA) marks a watershed moment in India’s external economic policy, one that could meaningfully reshape trade flows, competitiveness, and investor confidence over the coming decade. After nearly two decades of intermittent talks, the pact was finalised at a summit held in New Delhi, with leaders on both sides hailing it as a significant step towards deeper economic integration between two of the world’s major trading blocs.\n\nEssentially, the deal aims at extensive tariff removal and regulatory harmony in areas of goods, services, and investment. Following its ratification, the agreement is projected to gradually eliminate or significantly reduce duties on over 90 percent of bilateral trade by value, thereby granting Indian exporters access to the EU's largely protected market and, at the same time, raising Indian tariffs on key European products.\n\nThere are several layers of consequences for the Indian industry. On one hand, export sectors like pharmaceuticals, textiles, gems and jewellery, and labour-intensive manufactures are expected to become major beneficiaries of a deeper market access through reduced tariffs and regulatory alignment with EU standards. Some initial rough calculations point to export increases amounting to billions of dollars in categories such as ready-made garments, where preferential treatment, if given, can hold out a great competitive advantage for India against its rivals like Bangladesh and Vietnam.\n\nBesides tariff reductions, the FTA also envisages services trade liberalisation and mobility of skilled professionals, which could further boost India's current large IT, business services, and telecom exports to the EU. To many exporters, this comes as an important non-tariff factor that may help in lowering the barriers that have, for a long time, been associated with the lack of regulatory harmony in services.\n\nOn the import side, a lowering of tariffs on capital goods, intermediate inputs, and high-technology products from Europe, such as machinery, precision instruments, and specialised components, could result in reduced production costs for Indian manufacturers. In time, this cheaper access to quality inputs may lead to a closer integration with the European value chains, increase productivity, and result in more foreign direct investment in the manufacturing and technology sectors.\n\nHowever, the way forward is not without its complications. The implementation will be subject to ratification by the Indian parliament as well as the respective legislative bodies of the EU member states, and full liberalisation is anticipated to be brought in gradually over several years. Meanwhile, there still remain some structural issues: the rigorous EU standards for sanitary, phytosanitary, and environmental compliance might diminish the nominal tariff benefits if Indian exporters do not improve their quality and traceability systems.\n\nBesides, the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), a climate-linked levy on carbon-intensive imports, still remains a sticking point in the overall regulatory landscape. Although not fully settled within the agreement, CBAM could significantly influence the competitiveness of the steel, aluminium, and chemicals sectors, especially small and medium enterprises that are still trying to figure out new compliance regimes.\n\nConsidering these factors, the FTA's effect on investor confidence might even be more significant than its trade provisions. The agreement shows that India is ready to align with the high-standard global trade frameworks and to change its economic partnerships to different ones, especially considering the tariff fight with the United States.\n\nOverall, the India-EU Free Trade Agreement is a reflection of both a great opportunity and a highly challenging task. It may drastically improve the export competitiveness of India, bring the key industrial segments up to date, and help India become an even more important player in global value chains. However, to make the most of these opportunities, the necessary level of domestic reforms, strict adherence to regulatory standards, and continuous diplomatic efforts will be required on both sides as they will have to deal with the complex interaction of trade, climate policy, and strategic economic priorities.",

        "full_content": "Many parents notice that the Aadhaar card issued to small children looks different. It is blue, not white. This is the Blue Aadhaar card, issued to children below the age of five, and it follows a slightly different set of rules.\n\nThe biggest difference is that children under five do not have to give biometric details. No fingerprints or iris scans are taken. Instead, the Aadhaar number is linked to the Aadhaar of one parent or legal guardian. The idea is simple. Biometric details in young children change quickly, and capturing them too early creates problems later.\n\nThe Blue Aadhaar card contains the child’s name, date of birth, gender and Aadhaar number. A photograph of the child is taken at the time of enrolment. The card also carries a reference to the Aadhaar number of the parent who is linked to the child’s record.\n\nParents can apply for a Blue Aadhaar by taking the child to an authorised Aadhaar enrolment centre. One parent must already have Aadhaar. The process is largely the same as adult enrolment, except that biometric details are skipped. The child’s details are entered, the photograph is taken, and the parent’s Aadhaar is used for verification. Once this is done, an Aadhaar number is generated for the child.\n\nThe Aadhaar number issued at this stage is permanent. It does not change as the child grows older. What changes is the information linked to it.\n\nWhen the child turns five, biometric details have to be updated. This includes fingerprints, iris scans and a fresh photograph. The update must be completed before the child turns seven. If this step is missed, Aadhaar-based authentication may stop working until the update is done. This can create problems when Aadhaar is required for school admissions or other official processes.\n\nThere is another mandatory biometric update when the child turns 15. This update is meant to account for physical changes during adolescence. At both stages, the Aadhaar number remains the same. Only the biometric records are updated.\n\nAadhaar is not legally compulsory for children. However, it is increasingly asked for in everyday situations. Schools often ask for it at the time of admission. It is also used for government health schemes, scholarships and bank-related services. Because of this, many parents choose to enrol their children early to avoid complications later.\n\nThe Blue Aadhaar card itself does not expire and does not need to be replaced. Once biometric updates are completed, it automatically functions like a regular Aadhaar card. Parents mainly need to remember the two update stages, at five and at 15.\n\n1. Is the Blue Aadhaar a different kind of Aadhaar?\n\nNo. It is the same Aadhaar system, issued without biometric details for children under five.\n\n2. What happens if biometric details are not updated after age five?\n\nAadhaar authentication may not work until the biometric update is completed.\n\n3. Can Aadhaar be issued soon after birth?\n\nYes. Aadhaar can be issued to newborns as long as one parent has a valid Aadhaar number.",

But today, we believe we have adequate funding through the instruments we have outlined.” He added that both promoters remain committed and engaged in the business.\n\nSpeculation about a potential equity raise or induction of a strategic investor has persisted given Vi’s leverage and upcoming liabilities. However, management indicated that internal cash flow improvement, operational efficiencies and incremental debt will support both network investments and statutory obligations.\n\nA key factor underpinning that confidence is the AGR relief framework under which the company’s dues have been frozen at Rs 87,695 crore as of December 31, 2025, with a staggered, back-ended repayment schedule over 10 years.\n\nAt the same time, a reassessment of AGR dues for the period FY07 to FY19 is underway. “The reassessment has started and is progressing at a very encouraging pace,” Kishore said, declining to provide a timeline or indicate the potential quantum of relief. “We have all the supporting documents and are deeply engaged at multiple levels.”\n\nChief Financial Officer Tejas Mehta said about Rs 80,000 crore of AGR dues are already recognised on the balance sheet, with the balance disclosed as contingent liability in line with the frozen amount. He termed it premature to estimate the outcome of the reassessment.\n\nOn spectrum liabilities, the company made clear it is not seeking any moratorium or deferment from the government. Over the next three years, Vi faces spectrum payment obligations of about Rs 49,000 crore — approximately Rs 7,000 crore in the first year, Rs 15,000 crore in the second and around Rs 27,000 crore in the third.\n\n“We are not seeking any moratorium on spectrum liabilities. That is already built into our cash flow planning,” Kishore said. “Over the next three years, we have spectrum dues of around Rs 49,000 crore, and we are comfortable servicing them.”\n\nManagement said spectrum payments will be met through a combination of improving EBITDA, internal cash generation and planned bank funding. The company has set a target of tripling EBITDA over three years, driven by subscriber stabilisation, customer upgrades and capex-led revenue expansion.\n\n“With EBITDA expansion, operational efficiencies and bank funding, we believe we are in a comfortable position to service both spectrum payments and capex,” Kishore said. “Spectrum payments are part of our committed financial roadmap.”\n\nThe Rs 45,000 crore capex programme — in addition to around Rs 18,000 crore already invested over the past six quarters — will be front-loaded, with higher spending in the first two years to accelerate network rollout and returns. Roughly 70% of the outlay will be directed toward radio access, with the remainder allocated to transport and core network infrastructure.",

        "full_content": "If you don’t know your UAN off the top of your head, that’s completely normal. Most people don’t. It’s not something you use every month, and unless you’ve actively checked your PF online, it probably never mattered — until suddenly it does.\n\nYou try to check your balance or move your PF after changing jobs, and everything grinds to a halt at one question: “Enter your UAN.” Cue frustration.\n\nThe important thing to know is this: your UAN isn’t missing. It already exists. You just need to pull it out of the system once.\n\nWhat the UAN is, in plain terms\n\nYour Universal Account Number is a 12-digit number given by the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation. Think of it as your permanent PF identity.\n\nEvery time you change jobs, your employer opens a new PF account. All those accounts sit under the same UAN. That’s why EPFO keeps asking for it — it’s how they know all those PF balances belong to you.\n\nThe way most people find their UAN (and it usually works)\n\nIf your mobile number is linked to your EPF account, this is the simplest route.\n\nGo to the EPFO member portal and click on “Know your UAN”. Enter your mobile number and the captcha. An OTP comes to your phone.\n\nAfter that, the site asks for one more detail — PAN, Aadhaar, EPF member ID or passport number. You don’t need all of them. Just one that matches their records.\n\nIf everything lines up, your UAN appears on the screen and also comes as an SMS. For many people, this is a five-minute job.\n\nBefore all that, check your salary slip\n\nThis sounds boring, but it’s surprisingly effective.\n\nMany employers print the UAN on salary slips or annual salary statements. Look near the PF deduction line. If you’re still working with the same company, this is often the fastest way — no OTPs, no portals, no patience required.\n\nWhen the EPFO site tests your sanity\n\nSometimes the portal just… doesn’t behave. OTPs don’t arrive. Details don’t match. You get vague error messages that explain nothing.\n\nIf that happens, don’t keep retrying for hours. Just ask your HR or payroll team. They can see your EPF details and tell you your UAN directly. This is especially useful if your account was created years ago and your phone number has changed since then.\n\nThe most common problem: your old mobile number\n\nThis trips up a lot of people.\n\nIf the mobile number linked to your EPF account is no longer active, OTPs won’t reach you. In that case, you’ll first need to update your mobile number, either through the EPFO portal or with help from your employer.\n\nOnce the new number is approved and linked, the UAN lookup usually works smoothly.\n\nOne thing people forget after finding their UAN\n\nJust finding the UAN isn’t enough.\n\nDo this once, and future you will be grateful.\n\nYou don’t need to memorise your UAN. You just need to know how to retrieve it when the moment comes. Once you have it, activate it, save it somewhere safe, and make sure your contact details are up to date.\n\nThat small bit of effort can save you a lot of irritation later — usually at the exact moment you least want it.\n\n1. Is my UAN the same as my PF account number?\n\nNo. PF account numbers change with every job. Your UAN stays the same.\n\n2. Can I end up with two UANs?\n\nYes, it happens sometimes because of employer errors. EPFO allows you to merge them.\n\n3. Do I need Aadhaar to find my UAN?\n\nNot always. But Aadhaar and PAN are needed for withdrawals and online claims.\n\n4. Can I do this without a mobile number?\n\nNot online. OTP verification is mandatory, so you’ll need employer help.\n\n5. Does my UAN stop working if I take a career break?\n\nNo. It stays valid even if you’re not employed for years.",

        "full_content": "Vodafone Idea’s prolonged AGR burden had pushed the telco into a “vicious cycle” of funding constraints, underinvestment and customer losses — but the worst is now behind it, CEO Abhijit Kishore said, unveiling what he called a three-year reset plan aimed at restoring growth and profitability.\n\nFor years, the uncertainty around adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues kept lenders wary, limiting capital access and slowing network expansion. “The AGR overhang meant funding was not available. Without funding, investments and deployments suffered. That hurt network experience, impacted brand perception and led to subscriber losses,” Kishore said during the analyst and investor meeting on January 28. “That has been the cycle we were stuck in.”\n\nThe cycle, he argued, has now been broken by three developments. The first was Vi’s Rs 3,300 crore fundraise through non-convertible debentures (NCDs), secured even before AGR clarity emerged.\n\nThe second was the extension of the contingent liability adjustment mechanism (CLAM) with promoter Vodafone Plc. Originally capped at Rs 8,400 crore for seven years post-merger and expiring in June 2025, the agreement has now been extended until December 31, 2025. Of the remaining Rs 6,400 crore, Rs 2,300 crore will be infused in cash over the next 12 months, while shares worth Rs 328 crore have been earmarked for monetisation.\n\nThe third — and most critical — trigger is the AGR relief framework. Vi’s dues have been frozen at Rs 87,695 crore as of December 31, 2025, with a staggered and back-ended repayment schedule over 10 years. Annual payments will be capped at Rs 124 crore for the first four years, followed by Rs 100 crore annually for the next four, with the reassessed balance payable in six equal instalments between FY36 and FY41.\n\n“This is a definitive, long-term solution with clear visibility on cash flows,” Kishore said, adding that the relief strengthens not just Vi but India’s broader digital infrastructure ecosystem.\n\nWith regulatory uncertainty easing, Kishore declared a “Vi 2.0 reset” and laid out a three-year roadmap built around what he called the “1-2-3” framework: sustained customer additions, double-digit revenue growth and tripling EBITDA.\n\nTo deliver this, Vi will invest Rs 45,000 crore over the next three years — in addition to Rs 18,000 crore already invested over the past six quarters — taking total planned investment to over Rs 60,000 crore in roughly four years.\n\nThe bulk of the new capital will go toward aggressive network expansion. Vi plans to achieve 4G parity with competitors across its 17 priority circles — which contribute over 99% of revenue — within 12 to 24 months. Simultaneously, it will expand 5G coverage across urban markets with populations above 20,000 over the next 12–30 months.\n\nThe company also aims to convert remaining 2G sites to 4G in select circles, expand fixed wireless access (FWA) offerings for home and small-office users, and prepare for satellite communication services through its partnership with AST SpaceMobile, which Kishore expects to materialise over the next 18–24 months.\n\nSince its follow-on public offer (FPO), Vi has already invested Rs 16,000 crore, adding over 100,000 sites, increasing capacity by 43% in key markets and expanding population coverage from 77% to about 86 percent. The company has launched 5G in 43 cities, with Kerala becoming the first fully covered circle.\n\nOperational metrics are showing early signs of improvement. Annual subscriber losses, which had averaged 15–16 million over recent years, have narrowed to 5.3 million so far this year. Excluding a deliberate slowdown in low-quality customer additions in one quarter, net losses were just 1.5 million — a swing of nearly 12 million compared to prior trends.",

        "full_content": "The Government of India, in its last Union Budget, increased the foreign direct investment  (FDI) limit in the insurance sector to 100 percent. This move was a necessary and positive step, strengthening capital availability and reinforcing confidence in the sector’s long-term potential.\n\nAs the Union Budget approaches, expectations are focused less on ownership structures and more on the operating environment that ultimately determines penetration, profitability, and the sector’s contribution to the broader economy.\n\nFrom a market participant’s standpoint, the next phase of insurance growth will be driven not by incremental capital, but by policy choices that improve demand quality and duration of liabilities.\n\nFiscal policy: Signalling matters more than numbers\n\nFrom a fiscal standpoint, insurers are not expecting surprises. What matters is credibility and predictability. The assumption is that the government will continue on a path of gradual consolidation while protecting growth-oriented expenditure, especially capital spending.\n\nFor long-term allocators like insurers, the composition of borrowing is as important as the headline deficit. A predictable issuance calendar, stable maturity distribution, and clarity on the medium-term fiscal glide path are essential for duration management and asset-liability matching. Policy continuity that supports long-term domestic savings also strengthens fiscal outcomes by anchoring demand for government securities and reducing reliance on volatile external flows.\n\nIn this sense, fiscal discipline and insurance sector growth are mutually reinforcing rather than competing objectives.\n\nTax policy shapes risk behaviour\n\nTax policy remains the most powerful behavioural lever for insurance adoption. Insurers are not seeking broad tax concessions. What they are seeking is neutrality. Pure protection products like term life, health insurance, and basic accident cover reduce future economic vulnerability and implicit fiscal risk. A tax regime that does not penalise simplicity would materially improve protection penetration and portfolio quality.\n\nRetirement products present a similar issue. Insurance-based annuities provide guaranteed income streams, yet its tax treatment often compares unfavourably with alternative pension products. When tax outcomes dictate product choice, retirement adequacy suffers. Greater alignment across retirement instruments would allow households to choose based on risk and income needs rather than tax arbitrage.\n\nMicro-insurance needs economic viability\n\nMicro-insurance remains essential for financial inclusion, but its economics are fragile. High transaction costs, compliance overheads, and limited pricing flexibility constrain scale, despite clear social need. The industry is not looking for subsidies. It is looking for enabling conditions like simplified compliance for small-ticket policies, lower frictional costs, and support for digital-first distribution. When micro-insurance becomes viable, it reduces dependence on post-event fiscal support and improves resilience at the household level.\n\nPublic schemes: Scale to sustainability\n\nGovernment-sponsored insurance schemes have expanded coverage rapidly, particularly in health and agriculture. The next phase must focus on sustainability. Claims volatility, pricing discipline, and service delivery remain uneven, creating stress for insurers and contingent fiscal exposure for the state. From an industry perspective, the emphasis now should be on better data, clearer accountability, and smarter risk-sharing rather than further expansion. Improving scheme design is more effective than increasing allocations.\n\nInsurance as a structural buyer of duration\n\nFrom a capital markets perspective, insurance plays a role that is often underappreciated. Growing premium pools translate into long-duration liabilities, which naturally flow into government securities, infrastructure bonds, and high-quality corporate credit.\n\nIn an environment of uncertain global capital flows, insurers act as stable, counter-cyclical investors. Policy stability that supports steady insurance growth indirectly deepens bond markets, smoothens the government borrowing programme, and lowers systemic volatility.\n\nHigher insurance penetration also reduces the likelihood that economic shocks migrate onto the sovereign balance sheet, making insurance an understated but effective tool of fiscal risk management.\n\nCREATING A Strong Insurance Industry Landscape\n\nAlthough GST exemptions on retail life and health insurance have eased costs for policyholders, insurers remain unable to claim input tax credits on critical services such as distribution, customer support, and technology. These unrecoverable expenses elevate operating costs and eventually translate into higher premiums. To address this, the industry is urging the government to introduce a more flexible input credit framework and undertake broader GST rationalization in Budget 2026 to contain cost escalation and make insurance products more affordable.\n\nImproving affordability in rural and social insurance\n\nExpanding insurance coverage in rural markets continues to be constrained by cost sensitivity, particularly for low-premium products. Even modest transaction expenses, such as stamp dut,y can materially raise the final price of these policies. Offering stamp duty exemptions for rural and social sector insurance, similar to the framework used under PMJJBY, would help lower entry costs, enhance affordability, and support deeper penetration in underserved regions.\n\nUpdating outdated tax deductions\n\nSection 80D limits have failed to keep up with rapid medical inflation, with even standard family floater premiums now surpassing the allowable deduction. To offer meaningful relief, these limits must be significantly increased so they more accurately reflect current healthcare costs and provide genuine financial support to policyholders.\n\nFrom an insurer’s standpoint, Budget 2026 is not about higher spending or new incentives. It is about policy consistency, tax neutrality, and regulatory alignment. If these are delivered, insurance can do what it is structurally designed to do—protect households, stabilise the financial system, and convert long-term savings into long-term growth.",

        "full_content": "For most people, the address on their PAN card is an afterthought. You apply for PAN early in life, often using a parent’s house or a temporary address, and then you move on. Years pass. You change cities, rent homes, maybe even buy one. The PAN card address stays exactly where it was.\n\nNothing breaks immediately, so it’s easy to assume it doesn’t matter.\n\nBut PAN is no longer just a tax number you quote once a year. It sits quietly behind almost every financial system now. Bank accounts, investments, KYC checks, tax refunds, notices, all of it runs through PAN records maintained by the Income Tax Department. And somewhere in those records sits an address.\n\nMost people realise this only when something goes wrong. A tax notice goes to an old house. A refund is stuck because some verification didn’t line up. A bank flags a mismatch between PAN and Aadhaar during a routine KYC update and suddenly asks for documents you don’t have handy.\n\nNone of this is dramatic, but all of it is annoying and time-consuming.\n\nIf your Aadhaar already has your current address, updating your PAN address through Aadhaar is one of the simplest clean-ups you can do.\n\nHow to update your PAN address\n\nTo update your PAN address online, go to the official Protean (NSDL) or UTIITSL portal. Select ‘Changes or Corrections in existing PAN Details,’ fill out the form with your details, choose either e-KYC (Aadhaar-based) or document upload and submit your request. You will receive an acknowledgement to track your updated PAN card request. If you do Aadhaar-based KYC, it will get updated in minutes.\n\nAadhaar works as a single source of address for many systems now. It is issued and maintained by the Unique Identification Authority of India, and once PAN is linked to Aadhaar, the tax system is allowed to pull basic details like address directly from it.\n\nWhat this means in practice is that you don’t need to go hunting for electricity bills, rent agreements or bank statements just to change your PAN address. If Aadhaar already shows where you live now, PAN can simply mirror that.\n\nThat’s the key point. PAN does not magically update itself when Aadhaar changes. You have to initiate the update. But when you do, Aadhaar removes most of the friction.\n\nHow the update actually feels in real life\n\nThe process is online. You authenticate using Aadhaar, approve the address fetch, and submit the request. There’s no physical visit and no couriering documents. If everything lines up, the update usually goes through without drama.\n\nOne important thing people miss is this: if your Aadhaar address is outdated, updating PAN first won’t help. PAN will only copy what Aadhaar already has. So Aadhaar needs to be correct before you touch PAN.\n\nWhat does and doesn’t change after the update\n\nYour PAN number never changes. It is permanent. Updating the address does not affect your tax filings, past returns, refunds or assessments. It only changes where official communication is sent and how your identity details appear across linked systems.\n\nYou can choose whether you want a new physical PAN card with the updated address. Many people skip this now and rely on an electronic PAN instead, which is fully valid and avoids delivery problems, especially if you move often.\n\nWhy people usually delay this and regret it later\n\nPAN address updates are rarely done proactively. They’re done in response to a problem. A notice arrives at the wrong place. A bank puts an account on hold until details match. A refund is delayed because something didn’t verify cleanly.\n\nNone of these situations are serious on their own. But they all require follow-ups, emails, uploads and waiting. Updating your PAN address using Aadhaar is one of those boring housekeeping tasks that doesn’t feel urgent, until suddenly it is.\n\nIf you’re someone who moves houses often, especially on rent, keeping Aadhaar as your “main” address and syncing PAN to it is usually the least painful way to stay aligned.\n\n1. Does changing my PAN address affect my tax history or returns?\n\nNo. It does not change past filings, liabilities or refunds. It only updates your address for communication and verification.\n\n2. If I update Aadhaar, does PAN update automatically?\n\nNo. PAN does not update on its own. You have to separately request the address update using Aadhaar.\n\n3. Do I need a new physical PAN card after updating the address?\n\nNo. A digital PAN is equally valid. A physical card is optional.",

HAL would like to lease about 10 to 20 which can be bought from Russia directly in flyaway condition.\n\n“The leasing is a separate track because we buy out the aircraft directly. Manufacturing is setting up the facilities. And, as I said, in three years we will do the roll-out in a semi knock-down condition. Bring all the assemblies, assemble it. That is the target in three years. So, bring in all the facilities, bring in the test equipment and get it going. That is the target for three years,” he said.\n\n“In the next year or so, year and a half, we can get in about 10 aircraft. So, that is the idea that we are bringing in,” he said, adding that he is expecting a demand for over 200 SJ100 aircraft for Indian regional connectivity push.\n\n“We see a good market of upwards of 200 aircraft for this size of India and you know in the local region. So, there is enough market for an aircraft of this size.\n\nThe HAL official said the company would commence production of SJ100 in its existing facilities in the next three-four years.\n\nSunil said the aerospace major is in touch with some companies in GIFT City in Gujarat on leasing issues.\n\nGoing forward, in the next three to four years down the line, the SJ 100 and helicopters are going to become a significant component of the company’s revenues.\n\nHe further said state-owned Pawan Hans Ltd will procure 10 Made-in-India Dhruv New Generation (NG) helicopters from HAL and deploy them for offshore operations of ONGC.\n\nFurther there is an order from BSF for Dhruv NG choppers.\n\nReplying to a query, he said the company clocked Rs 31,000 crore revenues last year and this year it expects 7-8 per cent growth this fiscal.",

        "full_content": "The free trade agreement (FTA) between India and the European Union will be dynamic in nature whose benefits will materialise only if the government and the private sector leverage the opportunities it creates, Ernst & Young (E&Y) chief policy advisor DK Srivastava said on January 28.\n\nA day earlier, India and EU finalised an agreement after talks that stretched over two decades, slashing tariffs on most goods with aim to  boost trade.\n\n“I see tremendous potential in the FTA with the EU. It is going to be dynamic and evolving, which will not happen by itself,” Srivastava toldMoneycontrolin an interaction. “The private sector and the government will have to take advantage of the openings that will become available.”\n\nThe agreement offers India a chance to deepen its integration with European markets. Srivastava said trade agreements by themselves do not guarantee outcomes and must be backed by coordinated policy action, investment decisions and industry preparedness to translate market access into real economic gains.\n\nThe FTA will now go through a multi-stage process before it can be implemented. The final text will undergo what is referred to as “legal scrubbing”. Legal experts on both sides will vet the final text to ensure compliance with domestic and international laws.\n\nIt will also have to be ratified by the European Parliament and individual countries. A process that typically takes a year or more.\n\nAlongside with the trade pact, India and the EU agreed to security and defence partnership and enhanced dialogue on strategic ties.\n\nOne of the areas with significant potential is defence manufacturing, particularly through joint ventures, he said.\n\n“I see tremendous scope, as there is a strategic agreement on defence co-development and co-production. The maximum potential will be in that area,” Srivastava said.\n\nSuch partnerships can help Indian firms scale up manufacturing capabilities and integrate with global markets. “India can initiate a number of joint ventures in all of these areas so that we can access not only our large domestic market but also the EU market and the world market as a whole, and can give the benefit of economies of scale,” Srivastava said.\n\nAccording to him, FTA’s success will depend on how strategically India responds to the opportunities that emerge. “It is an evolving scenario, and it depends on how we play it,” he said.\n\nSrivastava said the Union Budget will play a critical role in determining how effectively India can capitalise on opportunities in sectors that require high upfront investment and are technology-intensive.\n\n“The Union Budget should allocate higher amounts so that co-production and co-development in defence initiatives and advanced technology sectors like artificial intelligence and data centres can be encouraged,” he said.\n\nTechnological capability would be a decisive factor in these sectors. Predictable policy support and adequate budgetary allocations would be essential to crowd in private investment, he said.\n\nOn the 16th Finance Commission, Srivastava said India needs a well-balanced system of fiscal transfers that supports both the Centre and the states over the long term without creating structural stress.\n\n“In the longer term, we look for a system of fiscal transfers so that it leaves both Centre and states’ finances in good financial health,” he said. “Excessive transfers or deficient transfers from the Centre to states are problematic.”\n\nWhile the 16th Finance Commission has completed its work and submitted its report to President Droupadi Murmu, the recommendations will be made public only after being laid before Parliament, a process that will coincide with the presentation of the Budget.\n\n“The Finance Commission is supposed to establish that kind of balance to leave both tiers in suitable fiscal balance,” Srivastava said.\n\n'Justice' to lower-income and mineral-rich states\n\nOn horizontal devolution, Srivastava called for stronger equalisation to address disparities among states. “On the horizontal side, inter-state distribution among states, we look at a system with the content of equalisation in overall transfers so that justice can be done to lower-income states and mineral-rich states that have suffered so far,” he said.\n\nSuch states should also gain from India’s expanding economy, Srivastava said, advocating a more equitable distribution framework that ensures neither the Centre nor the states are fiscally disadvantaged.",

        "full_content": "India’s industrial production rose to a 26-month high of 7.8 percent in December, up from 7.2 percent in November, according to data released by the government on January 28. The sharp pickup was driven by a broad-based acceleration across manufacturing, capital goods and infrastructure-linked segments, signalling resilient momentum at the end of the calendar year.\n\nManufacturing output—the largest component of the index—expanded 8.1 percent in December, compared with 8.5 percent in November, underscoring steady factory activity despite global uncertainty. Mining output rose 6.8 percent, while electricity generation grew 6.3 percent, pointing to sustained demand from both industry and households.\n\nCapital goods output increased 8.1 percent, reflecting continued strength in investment demand, even as growth moderated slightly from the double-digit pace seen in November. Infrastructure and construction goods remained a key support, rising 12.1 percent, marking another month of robust expansion linked to public capex and project execution.\n\nConsumer demand also showed improvement. Consumer durables output rose 12.3 percent, indicating stronger spending on discretionary items such as appliances and electronics. Consumer non-durables, which had been volatile for much of the year, expanded 8.3 percent, reversing the weakness seen in several earlier months.\n\nPrimary goods output grew 4.4 percent, while intermediate goods rose 7.5 percent, suggesting improving traction across the supply chain and reduced bottlenecks in manufacturing processes.",

        "full_content": "Most dormant accounts aren’t discovered because someone went looking for them. They surface when a debit card fails, a transfer bounces, or the banking app quietly tells you the account is inactive. It feels serious in the moment, but in most cases it’s just the bank being cautious, not punitive.\n\nA bank account is usually marked dormant when there has been no customer-driven activity for a long time, often two years or more. That means no deposits, no withdrawals, no transfers. Even logging into your app doesn’t always count. Banks follow broad guidelines set by the Reserve Bank of India, mainly to prevent fraud in accounts that appear forgotten.\n\nWhat dormancy does not mean is that your money is stuck or gone. The account is restricted, not frozen. The bank just wants to confirm that the person trying to use it is actually the account holder.\n\nIn practice, reactivation is less about banking and more about identity. For many people, the easiest option is simply going to the branch where the account is held and saying, “This account is dormant, I want to reactivate it.” You’ll usually be asked to fill out a short request form and show basic KYC documents like an ID and address proof. Some banks also ask you to make a small transaction, even a token deposit or withdrawal, just to register activity.\n\nIf your documents are in order, the account often becomes active the same day or within a couple of working days.\n\nSome banks now allow dormant accounts to be reactivated online or through their app, but this depends heavily on how old the account is and whether your KYC details are already complete. If your mobile number is linked and your documents are up to date, the app route can work. If not, the system will push you back to the branch. That’s not the bank being difficult; it’s compliance.\n\nWhere people usually get stuck is KYC. Older accounts often have outdated addresses, missing PAN details, or documents that no longer meet current standards. In those cases, the bank won’t reactivate the account until everything is updated. Once that’s done, the rest tends to move quickly.\n\nAs for charges, banks typically don’t charge a fee just for reactivating a dormant savings account. However, if your account had minimum balance rules and those weren’t met over time, those charges may still exist separately. It’s worth asking about this upfront so there are no surprises later.\n\nReactivation timelines are usually short. If nothing needs fixing, it can be done immediately or within a day or two. If documents need updating, it might take a bit longer, but it’s rarely a long-drawn process.\n\nCharges and minimum balance — one practical example can be added. We could briefly note that reactivation itself is free, but penalty charges may reduce the balance if the account was below minimum.\n\nA few things people often worry about unnecessarily: yes, your money continues to earn interest even when the account is dormant. Yes, you can choose to close the account instead of reactivating it if you no longer need it. And no, dormancy is not the same as an account freeze, which usually involves legal or regulatory issues.\n\nThe simplest way to avoid this happening again is to keep the account lightly active. One small transaction every so often is usually enough.\n\nIn the end, a dormant account is really just the bank saying it hasn’t heard from you in a while. Once you show up and say, “Yes, this is still my account,” things usually fall back into place with far less drama than people expect.\n\n1. Will I lose my money if my bank account becomes dormant?\n\nNo. Your money stays safe in the account and continues to earn interest as per the account rules. Dormant just means transactions are restricted until the bank verifies your identity.\n\n2. Can I reactivate a dormant account without visiting the branch?\n\nSometimes. If your KYC details are already up to date and your mobile number is linked, some banks allow reactivation through their app or internet banking. Older accounts usually still need a branch visit.\n\n3. How long does reactivation usually take?\n\nIf your documents are in order, it can happen the same day or within a couple of working days. Delays usually happen only when KYC details need updating.",

        "full_content": "The rupee’s slide over the past few months has turned the external sector into a key macro risk just as the government prepares for Budget 2026. With capital flows turning volatile, foreign investors pulling money out of Indian equities and global uncertainty weighing on emerging market currencies, economists say the Budget will be closely watched for signals on how India plans to shore up investor confidence, attract foreign capital and maintain fiscal credibility.\n\nThe rupee has weakened significantly in recent months, moving from around 86 to nearly 92 against the US dollar, driven by a mix of external and domestic pressures. These include delays in the India-US trade deal, sustained foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows, heavy dollar demand from importers and relatively limited intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The currency is currently trading near 91.73 to the dollar.\n\nEconomists point out that the depreciation is no longer just a currency story but a reflection of stress in India’s balance of payments. Gaura Sengupta, an economist at IDFC First Bank, said the capital account turned negative in the third quarter of FY26, amplifying pressure on the rupee.\n\n“The depreciation pressure on the rupee reflects the BoP deficit, with the capital account turning negative in Q3 FY26. The Budget is expected to focus on measures to support capital inflows,” Sengupta said.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Budget 2026 is expected to place renewed emphasis on attracting stable foreign capital. Measures such as enhancing foreign direct investment (FDI) limits in select sectors and offering tax incentives to overseas investors are likely to be considered.\n\nEconomists also expect the government to double down on its investment-led growth strategy through higher on-budget capital expenditure and policies aimed at crowding in private investment.\n\nSupport for exports is another area likely to gain prominence. With global demand remaining uneven, the government may announce targeted measures to diversify export markets for both merchandise and services, reducing dependence on a narrow set of geographies and improving resilience to external shocks.\n\nTax policy could also play a role in calming volatile portfolio flows. Madhavankutty G, group chief economist at Canara Bank said changes in withholding taxes and capital gains tax could help ease concerns among foreign investors and slow FII outflows.\n\n“Some changes in the tax structure, especially on withholding taxes and capital gains tax, can be expected to alleviate concerns on FII outflows,” Madhavankutty said.\n\nAt the same time, global investors will be watching the Budget for reassurance on fiscal discipline. Madhavankutty expects the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to reaffirm the government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation while retaining flexibility to support growth when she presents the Budget on February 1. A clearly articulated medium-term fiscal roadmap, including the debt-to-GDP trajectory, could be crucial in anchoring investor confidence at a time when the rupee and capital flows are under strain.",

        "full_content": "Public Provident Fund is one of the few long-term savings options where interest is calculated monthly but credited annually. That small detail creates an opportunity most investors miss. The government calculates PPF interest based on the lowest balance in your account between the 5th day and the last day of every month. If your contribution reflects in the account on or before the 5th, it earns interest for the entire month. If it comes in on the 6th or later, you lose that month’s interest completely.\n\nIn simple terms, the calendar date of your investment matters just as much as the amount.\n\nThe “extra month” interest trick explained\n\nThe trick is straightforward. Make your PPF contribution on or before the 5th of the month, ideally on the 1st. When you do this, your money earns interest for that full month. Delay it by even one day beyond the 5th, and that same money starts earning interest only from the next month.\n\nOver one year, this can mean earning interest for 12 months instead of 11. Over the full 15-year PPF tenure, the difference becomes meaningful, especially for those investing the maximum allowed amount.\n\nHow much difference does this actually make?\n\nAt today’s PPF interest rate, losing one month of interest on a large annual contribution may not feel dramatic in year one. But compounding works quietly. Over long periods, consistently investing before the 5th can add tens of thousands of rupees more to your maturity value, without any extra risk or effort.\n\nThis benefit is highest for investors who deposit a lump sum once a year. If you invest monthly, the same rule applies to every deposit, making timing even more important.\n\nThe safest approach is to set a personal rule to invest on the 1st of the month or immediately after the new financial year begins in April. Many banks take one or two working days to credit PPF deposits, so cutting it close to the 5th can backfire. Online transfers usually reflect faster, but even then, allowing a buffer is smart.\n\nIf you invest once a year, doing it in early April ensures you get interest for all 12 months of the financial year. If you invest monthly, treat the 1st as your fixed investment date.\n\nPPF is not about quick wins. It rewards consistency and patience. This timing rule does not change your risk, lock-in, or tax status. It simply ensures that your money works for you for the maximum possible time, every single month.\n\nOver a long horizon, small habits like this separate average returns from optimal ones.\n\n1. Is it enough to deposit before the 5th, or must it be on the 1st?\n\nAny deposit credited on or before the 5th qualifies for that month’s interest. Investing on the 1st is recommended only to avoid delays in bank processing.\n\n2. If I invest monthly, does this rule apply to every month?\n\nYes. Each monthly contribution earns interest only if it is credited before the 5th of that month. Miss the date, and that deposit earns interest from the following month.\n\n3. Does this strategy change my PPF maturity date or lock-in period?\n\nNo. Your PPF maturity and lock-in remain exactly the same. This strategy only affects how much interest you earn along the way, not the account rules.",

        "full_content": "PNB Housing Finance has no plans to exit corporate lending and the recent reduction in the loan book was part of a broader revamp of the business, managing director and CEO Ajai Kumar Shukla has said.\n\nThe company has now in place the required structure, leadership and sourcing teams, with plans to grow the segment's share of its total loan book to 8–10 percent within the next three years even as retail lending will continue to dominate the portfolio, Shukla told Moneycontrol in an interview.Edited excerpts:\n\nA fraud account was reported recently, though it was written off in FY23. Why the delay?\n\nAn account turning NPA (non-performing asset) does not automatically qualify as fraud. After the account was written off with 100 percent provisioning, a detailed forensic and due diligence process was undertaken. During this process, certain unfulfilled commitments came to light, following which the board decided to classify it as fraud in line with good governance practices.\n\nHave the regulator been informed and what action is being taken?\n\nYes, the fraud has been reported to the NHB (National Housing Bank) within the stipulated timeline. Legal proceedings are ongoing and remedial actions are in progress. The builder is also exploring options such as bringing in a partner or a buyout to resolve the matter.\n\nDespite a strong overall retail performance, affordable housing disbursements declined 15 percent YoY to Rs 786 crore in the December quarter? Why did this happen when prime and emerging segments are growing?\n\nThe decline in affordable disbursements was largely due to challenges in certain southern markets, particularly Tamil Nadu, following a government ordinance that temporarily disrupted activity. As a precautionary measure, the company adopted a wait-and-watch approach. The issue has since been clarified by the government and the management believes the market is now well placed for a revival.\n\nHow will disbursements shape up now that the issue has been resolved?\n\nThe fourth quarter is traditionally stronger for the industry and the company is already seeing month-on-month improvement. January disbursements are in line with expectations and the management expects the remaining two months of the quarter to be even better.\n\nCorporate loan assets have reduced sharply to Rs 272 crore, down 78 percent. Can we expect corporateloansto go to zero?\n\nNo, corporate loans will not go to zero. The reduction was a conscious strategic decision as the company revamped its corporate finance business. The structure, leadership,and sourcing teams are now in place, and business growth has resumed.\n\nIn the current calendar year, some momentum will be visible, translating into around 3-4 percent of the book by (the end of) FY26. FY27 will see further acceleration, with corporate loans rising to around 6-7 percent. Over the next two-three years, the corporate loan book is expected to stabilise at around 8-10 percent of the total portfolio, with retail forming the remaining 90 percent.\n\nWith pressure on NIMs across the sector due to rate cuts, how is the company planning to protect margins?\n\nThe company’s NIM stands at around 3.63 percent, within its guided range of 3.6-3.7 percent, which it continues to maintain. The strategy focuses on increasing the share of affordable, emerging, and construction finance businesses, which offer better yields and help sustain margins.\n\nManagement believes there is limited scope for further rate cuts. However, if a cut does occur, the benefit may be partially passed on by banks and institutions. Any impact on margins would be offset by higher-yielding segments like prime, emerging, and construction finance. The company aims to maintain NIMs in the 3.6-3.7 percent range even in that scenario.\n\nCapital adequacy has declined sequentially. Is there any plan to raise capital?\n\nThe company remains well-capitalised and does not see any need for raising capital in the near term.\n\nBorrowing costs have reduced sharply. What has driven this improvement?\n\nThe reduction is mainly due to better-negotiated term loans, benefits from repo-linked and MCLR-linked lending and refinancing through NHB at subsidised rates. Continuous churning from higher-cost to lower-cost borrowings has also helped bring down the blended cost.\n\nThe borrowing pattern is expected to remain largely the same in the near term, with adjustments depending on the interest rate trajectory in the next financial year.\n\nGross NPAs in the affordable segment have risen to 0.66 percent. Should this be a concern?\n\nWhile GNPA has edged up, it remains among the best in the industry and well within the company’s guidance. The increase was partly due to temporary disruptions in southern markets. Asset quality has since stabilised, with minimal difference between Q2 and Q3 figures, and management does not see any major concern.",

        "full_content": "Gold and silver ETFs surged up to 5 percent on January 28, mirroring the sharp rise in precious metals. Analysts have commented on whether it is time to take money out of equity markets and increase exposure to precious metals.\n\nElevated valuations in several markets, particularly in the AI and tech sectors, along with concerns about rising debt and earnings sustainability, mean equities are facing tighter conditions than they have in recent years, said Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead, VT Markets.\n\nWhat makes gold and silver so attractive?\n\nThe analyst further said that alongside this, Indian markets are facing the impact of wider macro issues with slowing growth signals, persistent geopolitical risk, and uncertainty around the path of interest rates. All of this combined makes gold and silver more attractive as defensive assets for investors, he said.\n\n\"Gold and silver also continue to look attractive. With real yields showing signs of peaking and central banks maintaining strong gold purchases, precious metals are benefiting from their role as stores of value. Silver adds an additional layer, given its industrial demand tied to energy transition and electronics,\" Maxwell said.\n\nThe rally is fueled by a perfect storm of factors heightened geopolitical risks which includes Middle East tensions and tariff threats under US policy shifts, said Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza. “This has positioned precious metals as a classic safe haven play,” he added.\n\nWhile safe-haven demand and industrial catalysts remain supportive, experts caution that this is not the optimal entry point for fresh allocations.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the decision should not be driven by recent price movements, but by how these assets behave and where they fit in a long term portfolio, said Subhendu Harichandan, Executive Director, Anand Rathi Wealth.\n\nFor investors, a lot will depend on portfolio objectives, time horizons and balance, Maxwell said. Gradually reallocating a portion of equity gains into gold or silver ETFs can help hedge downside risks, inflation surprises and policy missteps, according to the analyst. “However, making a more substantial shift away from equities assumes a sharp correction that is not yet clearly established yet,” he added.\n\nSiddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara, said that although gold and silver ETFs are surging to fresh lifetime highs, it would be premature for investors to shift a large part of equity capital to precious metals at these levels.\n\n“During times of volatility, metals serve as excellent portfolio diversifiers and thus, perform well but in the long run, equities are the main contributors to wealth creation. Therefore, a balanced strategy, first of all, maintaining a core equity exposure and then, gradually adding gold and silver through small, phased purchasing on bottoming, helps one stay on the right side of risk management and one's long, term plans as opposed to just following the recent peaks,” he said.\n\nChasing the recent velocity of gains risks buying at near-term peaks, while patience and strategic rebalancing will serve long-term goals better, according to the analyst. With gold and silver prices witnessing a sharp surge, investors in precious metals may consider booking partial profits at current levels rather than making fresh allocations, said Swapnil Aggarwal, Director, VSRK Capital.\n\nTiwari from Bonanza has highlighted different investment strategy for different kinds of investors:\n\nInvestors who don’t have any exposure to precious metals:These investors should consider gradually adding 5-10 percent via ETFs to hedge against ongoing uncertainty, inflation, or dollar weakness.\n\nInvestors who are heavily invested in equity markets:A partial rebalance by trimming overperforming stocks to fund metals allocation can improve risk adjusted returns without abandoning growth potential.\n\nCautious investors:If you are concerned about near term froth, you should monitor for corrections strong rallies often see healthy pullbacks before resuming. Avoid leverage or over concentration, the analyst said.\n\nDiversification remains the timeless principle. Equities offer long term compounding tied to corporate earnings, while precious metals provide insurance against systemic risks, Tiwari added.\n\nAjit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking, concluded by saying that gold and silver are not substitutes for equities - they are portfolio stabilisers. “With equities still driven by earnings growth and metals acting as a hedge against global uncertainty, currency volatility, and geopolitical risks, the right approach is not switching, but rebalancing. Investors should maintain a diversified asset mix across equities, debt, and precious metals, using metals as a strategic allocation rather than a tactical trade,” he said.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "Donald Trump did not set out to make the world more cooperative. Yet, paradoxically, his tariff tantrums have done precisely that.\n\nBy turning trade into a weapon-slapping duties, tearing up arrangements, and threatening allies as casually as rivals, the US has pushed the rest of the world to look for insurance.\n\nNew trade corridors are being stitched together, deals fast-tracked, and old negotiations dusted off. The newly signed India-EU agreement must be read squarely in this context.\n\nThis isurvashee shapam upakaram—a curse that turns into a blessing.\n\nTrump’s America-first economics has forced both India and Europe to hedge against US unpredictability. For Brussels, India offers scale, growth, and a democratic counterweight in a fragmented world.\n\nFor New Delhi, Europe provides market depth, technology, capital, and—crucially —diversification away from overdependence on any one bloc. The deal is less about romance and more about realism.\n\nAfter nearly two decades of on-again, off-again talks, speed itself tells a story. What was earlier bogged down by disagreements over tariffs, data, labour standards and sustainability was suddenly propelled by geopolitical urgency.\n\nEurope wants to reduce its exposure to US trade volatility and Chinese supply chains. India wants stable access to high-value markets at a time when global trade rules are becoming messier, not clearer.\n\nOn paper, the agreement looks impressive. Tariff reductions across a wide range of goods, better access for Indian services, investment facilitation, and deeper regulatory cooperation could all materially improve India’s export profile.\n\nEngineering goods, textiles, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and IT-enabled services stand to gain. For an economy that still struggles to break into global manufacturing value chains, Europe’s market—large, affluent and rules-based—offers a genuine opportunity.\n\nBut trade deals are won or lost not in summit photographs, but in execution. And this is where caution is warranted.\n\nSome of the clauses that Europe considers non-negotiable—particularly around climate and sustainability—can easily turn into hidden trade barriers.\n\nCarbon taxes, border adjustment mechanisms and stringent compliance norms may sound virtuous, but they risk penalising Indian exporters who operate in a very different cost and energy ecosystem. If carbon pricing becomes an indirect tariff, the promised market access could quickly narrow.\n\nThere is also the question of regulatory asymmetry. European firms are adept at navigating complex compliance regimes; Indian MSMEs are not.\n\nWithout serious domestic hand-holding — on standards, certification, logistics and finance — the benefits of the deal could accrue disproportionately to large firms, leaving smaller exporters squeezed out. Trade liberalisation without trade preparedness is a familiar Indian story, and not a happy one.\n\nThen there is timing. Europe’s own economy is slowing, grappling with energy transitions, political fragmentation and demographic headwinds.\n\nDemand growth may not be as robust as headline trade projections suggest. India, meanwhile, must ensure that it does not open sensitive sectors prematurely or concede policy space that it may need as its manufacturing ambitions evolve.\n\nNone of this negates the strategic value of the deal. In a world where the US is unreliable and China is assertive, India-EU cooperation makes geopolitical sense. It signals that India can still strike large, complex agreements without being boxed into binary choices. It also reinforces India’s claim to being a serious player in shaping post-US-centric trade architecture.\n\nYet optimism must be tempered with realism. Trump’s tariffs may have nudged the world towards each other, but they have not made trade easier — only more political.\n\nThe India-EU deal is an opportunity born out of disruption, not stability. Whether it becomes a growth engine or a missed chance will depend on how deftly India manages the fine print, supports its exporters, and negotiates future disputes.\n\nFor now, the curse has yielded a blessing. Whether that blessing endures will only be known with time.\n\nThe devil, of course, lies in the details.\n\nInvesting insights from our research teamEU-India FTA: Sectoral shake-up – Who gains, who loses?India–EU FTA: Not much impact on India’s mass passenger vehicle marketAsian Paints Q3 – Volume improves; pricing remains constrainedBruised but Not Broken: Stocks worth a bet amid the market weaknessMarico Q3 FY26: In-line performance, multiple growth triggersTata Consumer Q3 FY26: Growth businesses continue to deliverDCB Bank Q3 FY26: Earnings momentum builds, re-rating still has legsWhat else are we reading?Budget Snapshot | Why time is now the biggest creditor riskTrade as Strategy: Why the India–EU FTA belongs to today’s age of geoeconomicsWhy Japan’s yen intervention could rattle global marketsBig realty firms Q3 results show some cracks in luxury home salesCan BJP break Mamata's grip on Bengal in 2026?Physical or electronic bullion, where does the money lie?Investors bet on ‘hot’ US economy heading into mid-term elections(republished from the FT)Why the India–EU Trade deal finally happened and what it says about coercive trade practicesUnion Budget must spell out measures to strengthen corporate earnings growth, vital to bringing back FPIs and re-energizing the marketWhy this ‘Indian bear market’ should worry us a bitBudget 2026–27 calls for a stronger state-led capex pushIndia’s True Two-Front Battle: America and ChinaUnion Budget ideas to transform India’s citiesHow to win allies and get rich at the same timeBudget 2026 and the MSME Growth Agenda: Reducing compliance burden and enabling scaleMarketsBudget 2026 Playbook: 5 triggers that could ignite a post-Budget market rallyTech and StartupsBudget 2026: Food delivery ecosystem pushes for tax relief as costs pressure mounts on restaurants\n\nTechnical Picks: RECLTD, NLCINDIA, NMDC, ONGC, BEL\n\nDinesh Unnikrishnan Moneycontrol Pro",

        "full_content": "Defence shares advanced on Wednesday, with Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL), BEML rising up to 12 percent, driven by broad-based buying across the sector. The strong momentum pushed the Nifty India Defence index up by around 5 percent during the session.\n\nKey factors behind the sharp rise in defence shares\n\n1) India-EU defence pact:India and the European Union on Tuesday concluded a defence and security agreement aimed at enhancing cooperation in areas such as counter-terrorism, the Indo-Pacific and joint development of military hardware. The pact was finalised at the India-EU summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and European Council President Antonio Costa.\n\nOfficials said the agreement would improve interoperability in the defence sector and create opportunities for Indian companies to participate in the EU’s Security Action for Europe (SAFE) programme, supporting long-term growth prospects for domestic defence manufacturers.\n\n2) Rub-off from BEL rally:Shares ofBELjumped 10 percent to a record high of Rs 457.50 after the firm reported a 20.4 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit for the December quarter, while revenue from operations increased nearly 24 percent.\n\nBEL, which is also a constituent of the Nifty 50 index, saw heavy buying interest, triggering a spillover effect across other defence stocks.\n\n3) Pre-Budget rally:The rally also comes ahead of the Union Budget scheduled for February 1. The Nifty India Defence index gained about 5 percent amid expectations that the government may announce a meaningful increase in capital expenditure for the defence sector, according to brokerage firms.\n\nThe index extended gains for a second straight day and has risen more than 8 percent over the past two sessions.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "If you’ve opened an account without visiting a branch, signed documents digitally, and managed everything from your phone, you’ve already brushed up against what neo banks are trying to do. They’re not trying to replace banks altogether. They’re trying to remove the friction people associate with banking.\n\nIn the Indian context, most neo banks are not banks in the legal sense. They don’t have their own banking licence. Instead, they operate on top of an existing, regulated bank. Your money sits with that partner bank. The neo bank provides the app, the interface, and the features you use day to day.\n\nThink of it as a modern front desk built in front of a very traditional back office. The rules, compliance, and custody of funds remain old-school. The experience is what’s new.\n\nWhat you can actually do with a neo bank\n\nFor everyday use, neo banks cover most basics. You can open a savings account, get a debit card, receive salary credits, make UPI payments, transfer money, and pay bills. Where they feel different is in how clearly and quickly things happen.\n\nTransactions show up instantly. Spending is grouped automatically. You can freeze or unfreeze your card, change limits, or switch international usage on and off from the app itself. There’s less chasing customer care and more control in your own hands.\n\nSome neo banks focus on specific needs rather than everyone. Niyo, for instance, found early users among travellers and students by making foreign spending simpler and more transparent.\n\nDo they giveloansor credit cards\n\nUsually, no, at least not directly. When a neo bank offers a credit card, overdraft, or loan, it typically comes from a partner bank or NBFC. The neo bank handles the digital experience. The actual lender decides who qualifies, at what rate, and reports the loan to credit bureaus.\n\nFrom the user’s point of view, it feels smoother. From a risk and regulation point of view, it’s still traditional lending underneath.\n\nIs your money safe This is where clarity matters. In India, the money in a neo bank-linked account is held by a licensed bank regulated by the Reserve Bank of India. The neo bank itself doesn’t hold deposits.\n\nIf a neo bank shuts down or pivots, your account doesn’t vanish. It continues with the partner bank. Still, it’s worth knowing which bank that is before you sign up, instead of treating all fintech apps as the same.\n\nNeo banks work best for people who are comfortable doing everything on their phone and don’t need branch access. Freelancers, gig workers, young professionals, and frequent travellers often find them easier to live with than traditional bank apps. They are also useful for people who want a clearer picture of where their money goes without having to manually track it.\n\nWhere traditional banks still matter\n\nFor big-ticket loans, business credit, or situations where you want face-to-face problem-solving, traditional banks still dominate. Neo banks aren’t built for that depth. They’re designed to make routine banking feel less painful, not to handle every financial need.\n\nNeo banks provide speed and convenience, but they have limitations. Mostly, they do not possess their own banking licence and rely on partner banks for deposits and credit. Customer support is often only available online, product offerings are limited, and account continuity may be disrupted if partnerships end, leading to uncertainty for long-term users.\n\nNeo banks aren’t a revolution. They’re a layer. They sit on top of the existing banking system and make daily money management smoother and more transparent. For most people, they work best alongside a traditional bank, not instead of one.",

        "full_content": "Sterlite Technologies has flagged a fresh supply-chain risk from China even as demand improves, primarily driven by North American telecom fibre rollouts and data centre buildouts.\n\nThe company warned that restricted exports of germanium, vital for optical fibre manufacturing, from China, which accounts for around 80 percent of the global supply, could add to cost pressures, alongside American tariffs.\n\nSterlite Technologies chief executive officer Ankit Agarwal told Moneycontrol, “Availability of germanium will be a risk factor for us, which we are looking to mitigate.”\n\nThe company is evaluating alternative sourcing options in Europe, the US and other geographies amid a broader global push to secure critical mineral supply chains.\n\nAgarwal said the company expects improved margins but it would depend on two or three factors, including mitigate or reducing the impact of US tariffs, which remain significant, and availability of germanium.\n\n“More than 70–80 percent of germanium supply comes from China and sourcing is currently a challenge due to restrictions,” he said.\n\nGermanium is a key input in optical fibre manufacturing, used to raise the refractive index of the fibre core and enable efficient, low-loss signal transmission.\n\nHigh-purity germanium dioxide is added during production to improve telecom and data centre performance.\n\nChinese curbs can directly impact fibre production costs and supply chains.\n\nAgarwal said rare earth self-sufficiency is becoming a policy priority globally, including in India.\n\nThe caution on raw materials comes even as STL narrowed quarterly loss and reported higher EBITDA for the December quarter , supported by improving demand in North America and growing traction in the data centre and enterprise segment.\n\nAgarwal said STL remains focused on the US and Europe, where fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) expansion, 5G deployments and accelerating data centre capital expenditure are driving demand.\n\nBeyond hyperscaler investments, fibre requirements within and between data centres are also growing.\n\nThe company secured nearly Rs 500 crore in orders from the data centre and enterprise segment, with the order book improving sequentially. This segment now contributes about 20 percent to revenue and is expected to rise to 30 percent over the next 12–18 months, the company said.\n\nMargins, however, remain under pressure from US tariffs. While reported EBITDA margins are currently around 11–12 percent, Agarwal said they would have been closer to 19–20 percent in the absence of tariffs.\n\nSTL is targeting utilisation levels above 70 percent, which it believes can sustainably generate 20 percent EBITDA margins.\n\nTo cushion the tariff impact, STL is optimising output at its US cable facility while continuing to serve the market through both domestic and global operations.\n\nRevenue contribution from the US increased to nearly 36 percent from about 25 percent last year, with both volumes and revenue rising. Agarwal expressed hope that an interim India–US bilateral trade agreement could provide relief.\n\nOn broader market trends, North America is leading the recovery in global fibre demand, driven by telecom and data centre investments. Europe remains stable but is expected to accelerate data centre build-outs amid supportive regulations.\n\nIn India, BharatNet investments are expected to provide medium-term visibility, while the domestic data centre market, currently around 1.5 gigawatts, could expand to 7–8 gigawatts by 2030, creating incremental demand for fiber infrastructure. Fibre-to-the-home and fibre-to-enterprise deployments are also expected to remain strong.\n\nWhile recent data centre interconnect (DCI) wins have largely come from North American telecom customers, Agarwal said global hyperscaler investments in Europe and Asia could translate into similar opportunities over time, though near-term growth remains concentrated in the US.\n\nAt home, he expects all three private telecom operators, including Vodafone Idea, following clarity on adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, to continue investing in fibre networks to support 5G rollouts, FTTH expansion and data centre connectivity.",

A weak rupee has made imports and commodities more expensive.\n\nHere is how a kilogram of silver has moved.\n\nThe Augmont Bullion, published on January 27, said silver surged past the $115 mark, driven primarily by a sharp weakening of the US dollar and rising policy uncertainty.\n\n\"The dollar slipping to a four-year low, combined with slumping US consumer confidence and concerns over the labour market, has strengthened the case for defensive assets,\" the report stated.\n\nAdded to this, tariff threats and perceived pressure on Fed independence have amplified geopolitical and policy risk premiums—firmly underpinning gold and silver prices.\n\nThe report said that silver is resuming higher towards $120 (Rs 3,90,000). Key support is seen at $103 (Rs 3,40,000); a break could lead to retracement towards $100 and $97.",

        "full_content": "As the Union Budget 2026 draws closer, taxpayers are expecting the government to prioritise easing TDS norms, simplifying compliance, and strengthening dispute resolution frameworks, instead of rolling out major policy changes.\n\nRethinking the need for TDS requirements\n\nThere is a demand for reducing TDS for people in the lower and middle-income groups. For many taxpayers, the current system creates unnecessary paperwork and cash flow problems. “With current TDS rates ranging from 10 percent to 30 percent, TDS significantly reduces cash flow for both salaried workers and entrepreneurs. Faster refunds must be introduced immediately; taxpayers currently experience a 6-12 month waiting period before receiving their refund, causing billions of rupees in lost capital. said Karthik Narayan, Vice President (Tax & Transition), Stellar Innovations.\n\n“AI technology should be utilised to allow Refund Payments to be processed within 30 days, and taxpayers should be able to file Form 16 in a simplified manner. The threshold for TDS exemption should also be raised to Rs 5,00,000,” Narayan said.\n\nTax professionals say Budget 2026 could make a meaningful difference without resorting to headline-grabbing tax cuts.\n\nAnkit Rajgarhia, Designate Partner at Bahuguna Law Associates, says the focus should be on certainty rather than frequent changes to rates or slabs. “What is needed is a simplified withholding framework with fewer rates and clearer rules,” he says. Faster dispute resolution and administrative remedies to address long-pending litigation would also ease pressure on the system, he adds. For salaried taxpayers, Rajgarhia believes clearer provisions and a stronger standard deduction within the new tax system would provide targeted relief.\n\nRefund delays remain another persistent concern. Despite improvements in automation, refunds are still held up over minor mismatches between employer filings, bank-reported data and annual information statements. In many cases, these discrepancies have little bearing on actual tax liability but still trigger verification checks that slow processing.\n\nFor households managing EMIs, education expenses and regular investments, refunds are not incidental. Excess tax deducted during the year represents money that could have been deployed elsewhere. With most income data already available digitally, taxpayers argue that refund timelines should be shorter and more predictable.\n\nThe impact of conservative withholding is not limited to individuals. Businesses, particularly in sectors with tight cash cycles, also feel the strain. Multiple layers of tax deduction on payments to vendors and service providers can lock up working capital and increase compliance overheads.\n\nSubham Kalindi, a senior executive at a renewable energy company, says high upfront deductions affect liquidity at both the individual and project level. “When cash is locked away because of conservative withholding, it creates stress across the value chain,” he says. “Using real-time income visibility more effectively can reduce this pressure without weakening revenue collection.”\n\nWhile individual taxpayers are focused on cash flow and refunds, investors are watching Budget 2026 for stability rather than fresh tax tinkering. Ravi Singh, Chief Research Officer at Master Capital Services, does not expect further changes to capital gains taxation this year. According to him, long-term investors have already adjusted to recent revisions, and predictability now matters more than incremental concessions.\n\nAcross income groups, the message is consistent. Taxpayers are asking for a system that deducts more accurately during the year and returns excess amounts without friction.\n\nIf the simplified tax system is meant to make compliance easier, many believe that promise should extend beyond filing day.",

        "full_content": "Zoho has entered the enterprise resource planning (ERP) market, taking on global giants such as SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft in a space long dominated by legacy players.\n\nThe company is launching its ERP platform first in India, positioning it as a more integrated, affordable, and user-friendly alternative for businesses.\n\nAt the same time, Zoho has announced the expansion of its presence in Kumbakonam with a new campus that can eventually accommodate up to 2,000 employees, strengthening its hub-and-spoke model and its focus on rural development through technology.\n\nExplaining the thinking behind this move, founder and chief scientist Sridhar Vembu says legacy ERP companies are “bloated, expensive and greedy,” echoing what customers themselves feel.\n\nThat critique shapes Zoho’s ambition to build simpler, customizable, and India-first products.\n\nIn this conversation with Moneycontrol, Vembu speaks about Zoho’s ERP strategy, the Kumbakonam expansion, plans for north India, semiconductor design, navigating the AI wave, and why patience and long-term product thinking remain central to Zoho’s approach.\n\nWhy does Zoho believe it can challenge legacy ERP players?\n\nERP is competitive, but Zoho knows how to compete. We have proven that on a global scale. What I like about this market is that we are facing legacy players like SAP and Oracle who are bloated, expensive, greedy, and just money-grubbing. Customers themselves say these things. We want to directly attack that with a much better value proposition that is more user-friendly, customizable, and ready to go.\n\nWhy launch ERP in India first?\n\nIndia is not an afterthought for us. For SAP or Oracle, India is an afterthought. For us, it is our first market. That is why our ERP is tailored for India from the beginning and deeply integrated with India’s DPI stack, including banking, payments, and e-commerce.\n\nWhat makes Zoho’s ERP different?\n\nIt is much more user-friendly and much more integrated. Nobody does e-commerce well in the ERP space. We do. It becomes a kind of digital nervous system for the enterprise. It is more customizable and much more affordable.\n\nHow big is the ERP opportunity?\n\nGlobally, it is at least a $253 billion market, bigger than CRM. We have built this system over 17 years with all the subsystems. We are the only player that comprehensively covers all aspects of ERP. We expect to take a decent and fair share of the market, though I cannot predict exact numbers.\n\nWhat does today’s Kumbakonam announcement mean to you personally?\n\nThis is my native region. People often think I am from Tenkasi, but I was actually born not far from here. So it is a particularly special moment for us.\n\nWhat are Zoho’s plans for Kumbakonam?\n\nWe already have about 250 people spread across two offices here. We want to invest and grow in this region just like we have done in Tenkasi. Most of our investments are going into rural parts, and this region is a key part of that push. We think of it as rural development through research and development.\n\nHow many jobs can the new campus support?\n\nWe have about 250 people now and want to grow that to around 2,000. That is what the campus is built for. How fast we reach that depends entirely on how the products grow.\n\nHow is this similar to your hub-and-spoke model?\n\nIt is very similar to what we pioneered in Tenkasi. We plan schools, and we may eventually run our own K-12 school under NAOS. We may run clinics. We invest in rural communities, like restoring ponds. We encourage employees to participate in community activities. We are not here just to build software. We also want to be part of the holistic development of the region.\n\nHow do you see the talent pool in Kumbakonam?\n\nThe talent situation is good all over India. Kumbakonam is special because this is the land of Srinivasa Ramanujan. There is strong mathematical and software talent here. We invest heavily in training and in nurturing this talent.\n\nWhat are the timelines for scaling this campus?\n\nThat depends on product adoption and global growth. We do not try to predict exact timelines. But the campus is built so that we can scale up to ten times in terms of talent pool.\n\nWatch the video interview: Small town, Big tech: Sridhar Vembu on Zoho’s rural push, AI Bubble, SaaS consolidation & many more\n\nWhat is Zoho’s right to win in ERP?\n\nOur value proposition is simple. We are more affordable, more customizable, and much more user-friendly. We are deeply integrated with our own ecosystem. And India is our first market, not an afterthought. That is why we believe we can win.\n\nAre you still planning expansion in north India?\n\nYes. We paused for about a year or a year and a half because we had to navigate the AI shift. We did not want to distract ourselves. Now we feel more confident. This year, we will have some announcement from Uttar Pradesh.\n\nWhat is happening with your semiconductor plans?\n\nWe are investing in semiconductor design. We have put the fab plan on hold for now because of our focus on AI. We will revisit it in a couple of years. We have too many things going on right now.\n\nDo you think there is an AI bubble?\n\nThere is definitely a bubble component. A company raised $2 billion at a $12 billion valuation with no product, just based on the founders’ resumes. Now people are leaving and there is still no product. That tells you everything. AI is real, but you can over-invest and waste a lot of money. That will happen in AI too.\n\nHow is Zoho approaching AI differently?\n\nWe are both AI-boosting our business and AI-proofing our business. We are confident we will survive and prosper. Just like SaaS came back to reality and Zoho was one of the winners, we hope to navigate AI in the same way.\n\nShould India build massive foundational models like the US?\n\nThere are three problems. First, India is limited to around 50,000 GPUs, while the major players have millions. Second, GPUs are extremely expensive. Third, the power requirement is enormous. Each GPU uses 500 to 700 watts, and they are talking about gigawatt-scale data centres. We cannot blindly copy the US. We have to be smarter and more patient.\n\nThere has been some talk about a slowdown in Arattai’s growth. How do you see its progress?\n\nPace is not the most important thing for us. What matters is consistency and seriousness in execution. The team has been working continuously on Arattai, even during holidays, and that shows their commitment. It is doing well, and we are steadily improving the product. We are focused on building it the right way rather than rushing for quick milestones.\n\nWhat can we expect from Zoho this year?\n\nThere will be many product launches. We have a strong pipeline. More importantly, we are combining everything into a powerful platform. Our “operating system for business” is becoming much stronger, with deeper AI integration and our own models, not just API wrappers.\n\nConsolidation will continue. There are too many companies. Many are buying growth through marketing and struggling to make profits. There will be fewer players, and we hope to be one of the winners.\n\nHow would you sum up Zoho’s approach today? And what would be your budget expectations?\n\nWe focus on patience, long-term product building, and strong R&D. We have navigated major technology shifts before, and we will do it again. My only ask from the budget is that it should focus on R&D and accelerate R&D investments in India.",

        "full_content": "Most people don’t think about their PPO number when they retire. In fact, many don’t even know they have one. It usually comes up only when something doesn’t work the way it should. A pension gets delayed. A bank asks for a number you can’t find. A life certificate doesn’t go through.\n\nThat number they’re asking for is the Pension Payment Order, or PPO.\n\nOnce you retire under the Employees’ Pension Scheme, your monthly pension runs on this number. It’s how the system knows who you are, how much pension you’re entitled to, and where the money should go. As long as your pension keeps coming on time, you may never need to look it up. But the moment there’s a hiccup, the PPO becomes important.\n\nThe PPO is issued when your pension claim is processed by the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation. Earlier, pensioners were often given a physical PPO booklet. Many older retirees still have one lying in a cupboard somewhere. These days, PPOs are mostly digital, which is why many people don’t realise a number has been generated at all. Also, the PPO continue for family pension, and is it still used after the pensioner’s death.\n\nUnlike your Provident Fund account number or Universal Account number, the PPO only matters after retirement. It stays with you for life. Even if you change banks or move to another city, the PPO does not change.\n\nPeople usually need the PPO number for things that sound routine but quickly turn stressful without it. Submitting a life certificate. Changing the bank where the pension is credited. Checking why a pension hasn’t come in one month. Raising a complaint. Banks and EPFO offices almost always ask for the PPO first.\n\nIf you don’t know your PPO number, there are a few practical ways to find it.\n\nOne way is through the EPFO pensioner portal, where pension-related details can be viewed once you log in with the required information. Another option many retirees find easier is the UMANG App. The app brings multiple government services together. Under EPFO pension services, you can retrieve PPO details after verification. For people comfortable using a smartphone, this often turns out to be the quickest route.\n\nYour bank is another reliable source. If your pension is already being credited, the bank has your PPO number on file. Sometimes it appears on pension slips or annual pension statements. A visit to the pension desk at your branch can usually sort it out.\n\nSome retirees also find their PPO number in old paperwork from the time they retired, such as pension sanction letters or correspondence from EPFO. It’s worth checking before assuming the number is lost.\n\nThere’s often confusion between PPO numbers, PF account numbers and UANs. They serve different purposes. The PF number and UAN are linked to your working years and provident fund contributions. Even after retirement, they may be needed for PF withdrawals or service history. The PPO is different. It is used only for pension. Monthly pension payments are tracked through the PPO, not the UAN.\n\nKeeping your PPO number written down somewhere accessible can save a lot of back-and-forth later. Most pension-related issues are easier to resolve once that number is available. As more services move online, quoting the correct PPO has become unavoidable.\n\nFor many retirees, the PPO only matters when something goes wrong. Knowing where to find it makes those situations far less stressful.\n\n1. Is the PPO number the same as my UAN or PF account number?\n\nNo. UAN and PF account numbers relate to your employment and provident fund. PPO is issued after retirement and is used only for pension payments.\n\n2. Will my PPO number change if I change banks?\n\nNo. The PPO number remains the same for life. Only the bank account linked to it can be changed.\n\n3. What if I can’t find my PPO number online or in old papers?\n\nYour pension-disbursing bank or the EPFO pension office can usually retrieve it using basic identity and bank details.",

        "full_content": "With Budget 2026 around the corner, expectations are building around a possible increase in tax exemptions for senior citizens. Hopes are mounting for the expansion of National Pension System (NPS) tax benefits and a comprehensive scheme covering in-home care for the elderly.\n\nFocus on higher exemption limits\n\n“Senior citizens hope that Budget 2026-27 will offer a more simplified and beneficial tax structure, focusing on higher income exemption limits, increased health insurance deductions, and streamlined compliance to offset inflation,” said Rajarshi Dasgupta, executive director (Tax), Aquilaw.\n\nThough there are various deductions available for Indian residents above 60 years of age under the Income Tax Act, analysts say the exemption limit should be raised to provide much-needed relief for senior taxpayers.\n\nFor instance, Section 80TTB allows resident senior citizens (60-80 years) under the old tax regime to avail of a deduction of up to Rs 50,000 on interest earned from savings and fixed deposits. Tax analysts hope for Budget 2026 to enhance the deduction limit for senior citizens.\n\nOther key demands include increasing tax exemption limits for medical treatment of critical illnesses under Section 80D for senior citizens, and under Section 80DDB for treatment of critical and chronic illnesses, along with streamlining TDS and TCS to reduce compliance hurdles.\n\n“An upward revision of exemption thresholds, coupled with simplified slab structures, would provide much-needed relief to pensioners and retirees dependent on fixed incomes,” said Kunal Savani, partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.\n\nTax analysts say many senior citizens have passive income in the form of capital gains but such profits earned from capital gains aren’t eligible for a tax rebate under Section 87A.\n\n“Given the current scenario of rebate under section 87A, one can expect the government specifically spell out its allowance to senior citizens to avail the rebate on such capital gains, which provides the much-needed relief to such senior taxpayers,” Savani said.\n\nHopes are also building for enhanced pension participation through the National Pension System (NPS), which offers significant tax benefits via deductions under Section 80CCD under both old and new tax regimes.\n\n“Extending tax benefits on NPS contributions under the new tax regime to both salaried and self-employed individuals will help encourage long-term, disciplined retirement savings,” PB Fintech's retirement planning arm Pensionbazaar head Vishwajeet Goel said.\n\nPB Fintec joint group CEO Sarbvir Singh said there is an urgent need for sustained, long-term pension savings and retirement preparedness is emerging as a critical pillar of India’s financial ecosystem.\n\n“The Budget 2026 can encourage disciplined retirement savings by extending NPS tax benefits to both salaried and self-employed individuals. Also, delinking employer participation from the employee’s tax benefit will allow voluntary contributions up to the defined threshold,” Sing said.\n\nComprehensive scheme covering the in-home care\n\nOptimism is growing that the Budget 2026 will establish a comprehensive scheme of benefits covering in-home care, assisted living support and transitional care facilities for senior citizens.\n\nAnalysts argue that the biggest cost pressure seniors face is not hospitalisation but prolonged home-based care such as attendants, nursing, physiotherapy and assisted living support, which runs for years and is almost entirely out-of-pocket.\n\n“Budget 2026 can realistically ease this by recognising certified home-care and long-term care expenses as core health costs with a separate, high-limit tax deduction for seniors and their children, instead of forcing families to absorb these recurring costs without any fiscal relief,” said Raheel Patel, partner, Gandhi Law Associates.",

The stock has gained around 21 percent in 2026 so far.\n\nThe sharp surge in the shares of the Vedanta Group-company comes amid the rally in copper prices, after the red metal gained 60 percent in 2025.\n\nWhy Hindustan Copper prices are rising today?\n\nThe latest surge in the stock also comes after the company announced on January 24 that it has emerged as the preferred bidder for Baghwari-Khirkhori Copper and associated mineral block in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe company had participated in the state government’s e-auction for the grant of mining lease and composite license for the said block. “Since, HCL had submitted the highest final price offer, it has been declared as the Preferred Bidder for this auction,” it said.\n\nAfter the announcement, the shares of the company surged around 5 percent on January 27. The stock has now gained nearly 19 percent in just two sessions since the announcement.\n\nCopper futures with February expiry rose nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 1,328.95 per kilogram on Wednesday. The contracts are nearing its all-time high level of Rs 1,413.55 per kg. This comes amid falling dollar and supply constraints.\n\nCopper’s long-term fundamentals remain strong, and Indian investors increasingly seek global commodity exposure to help diversify their portfolios and use as hedges against inflation, said Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead, VT Markets.\n\nHindustan Copper shares have gained more than 19 percent in the past five days, and over 29 percent in the past one month. The stock rallied 154 percent in the past six months, and is up 26 percent in 2026 so far.\n\nThe stock currently has a P/E ratio of 94.93, and the company’s market capitalization stands at around Rs 61,000 crore.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "The Aditya Birla Group plans to invest around $6 billion over the next five years to expand aluminium and copper upstream capacities in India, Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said. This marks the Group’s pivot back to primary metals as economic and industry conditions turn favourable, with group firm Hindalco Industries expected to anchor the investment cycle.\n\nKM Birla outlined the investment plan in his annual reflections note for 2025-26, where he said the Group is moving ‘decisively once again’ to scale upstream capacity after a prolonged phase of downstream-led capital allocation. The expansion plan is expected to reinforce Hindalco’s position as an integrated metals producer, with a strong footprint across aluminium and copper value chains.\n\nWhy Aditya Birla Group is returning to upstream metals\n\nThe renewed focus on upstream investments comes after a deliberate strategic shift in the previous cycle. In 2018, Hindalco had completed a major upstream expansion just as global aluminium markets came under pressure from Chinese overcapacity, while rising input costs -- particularly coal -- compressed margins. In that environment, further upstream expansion made limited economic sense, said Birla.\n\nAlso read|Vodafone Idea’s turnaround moment has arrived after AGR clarity: Kumar Mangalam Birla\n\nAs a result, Hindalco redirected capital towards building downstream capabilities, investing steadily over the following five years in value-added products that require closer customer collaboration and a different operating model from commodity metal production. That phase resulted in what the Group now describes as the deepest downstream metals capabilities in India.\n\nAccording to Birla, the context has since changed materially. China’s decision to cap primary aluminium production has helped stabilise global prices, while improved access to critical raw materials has enabled Hindalco to strengthen its cost structure. Together, these shifts have reopened the economic case for large-scale upstream investments.\n\nBirla emphasised that the decision reflects the need for strategy to remain responsive to changing conditions, rather than being bound by past choices. He cautioned against equating consistency with rigidity, adding that capital must be deployed where opportunity and economics align. “Strategy does not define the business; the business context defines strategy,” Birla said, noting that staying close to data and operating realities is essential to avoiding strategic dogma.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The order intake was robust at USD1.6b for 9MFY26 (+21% YoY), even the NTM executable order book stands healthy at USD1.7b (+26% YoY).

        "full_content": "For a lot of people, State Bank of India is the first place they think of for a personal loan. Not because it promises instant money, but because it feels solid. SBI doesn’t rush you or flatter you. It simply checks whether you fit, and if you do, the loan happens.\n\nThe first real decision isn’t about interest rates or tenure. It’s much simpler: do you want to do this online by yourself, or do you want to sit across a desk and talk it through?\n\nWhat SBI means by a “personal loan”\n\nSBI doesn’t lump everyone together, and that’s actually helpful.\n\nIf you’re salaried and your salary comes in regularly, you’re usually looked at under salary-linkedloanslike Xpress Credit. If you’re a government employee, in defence services, or a pensioner, you’re in a different category and often get slightly better terms. If you’re self-employed, you can still apply — just be prepared for more questions and more documents.\n\nIn all cases, it’s an unsecured loan. No property, no gold, no guarantees.\n\nApplying online: Best when your life is simple on paper\n\nIf you already have an SBI account and your KYC is up to date, applying online is usually the smoothest experience.\n\nYou go to SBI’s loan site, choose thepersonal loanoption that fits you, and fill in the basics — income, employer, how much you want, how long you want to repay. If you’re an existing customer, a lot of this may already be filled in.\n\nYou upload your documents, wait for digital checks, and if nothing looks unusual, approval often comes in a couple of working days. Sometimes sooner.\n\nOnce you accept the loan offer, the money is credited straight to your account. No visits, no follow-ups, no awkward phone calls.\n\nGoing to the branch: Slower, but reassuring for many people\n\nPlenty of people still prefer going to the branch, especially if this is their first personal loan or their income doesn’t fit neatly into boxes.\n\nAt the branch, a loan officer explains what you’re eligible for, helps you fill the form, and tells you upfront if something might be an issue. You hand over physical copies of documents and let them handle the rest.\n\nIt can take a bit longer, yes. But you also don’t sit at home wondering whether your application is stuck somewhere in the system.\n\nDocuments: Nothing exotic, just don’t let them clash\n\nNo matter how you apply, the document list is fairly standard.\n\nAadhaar and PAN are usually enough for identity and address. Salaried people need recent salary slips and bank statements. Self-employed applicants need income tax returns and business documents.\n\nWhat really matters is that details match across papers. When names, addresses and income numbers line up, everything moves faster.\n\nInterest rates, without the marketing gloss\n\nSBI doesn’t give everyone the same interest rate.\n\nWhat you get depends on your credit score, how steady your income looks, where you work, and which loan bucket you fall into. Broadly, rates start in the low double digits and go up if the bank feels there’s more risk.\n\nThe final rate is shown before you accept the loan. That’s the number that will decide your EMI every month, so it’s worth actually reading it instead of clicking through.\n\nHow much you can borrow and how long you’ll repay\n\nYour loan amount depends on how much you earn and how many EMIs you already have running. SBI usually gives a few years to repay, with fixed EMIs from day one.\n\nMost people aren’t asked for a guarantor. That usually comes up only if the profile is borderline.\n\nThings people usually realise only later\n\nSBI asks questions. Job gaps, frequent switches, uneven income — all of these can trigger follow-ups. That doesn’t mean rejection. It just means SBI likes to be sure.\n\nAlso, don’t ignore the prepayment and foreclosure clauses. Some SBI loans let you close early with little or no penalty after a point. Others don’t. If you think you might repay early, this matters more than shaving off 0.25 percent on interest.\n\nAn SBI personal loan isn’t about speed or hype. It’s about certainty. If your income is steady and your paperwork is clean, the loan usually goes through. The only real question is whether you want to do it quietly online, or talk it out with someone at the branch.\n\n1. Is applying online actually faster?\n\nUsually, yes — if your profile is clean and KYC is done.\n\n2. Does SBI need a very high credit score?\n\nThere’s no official cut-off. Higher scores help, lower scores mean more scrutiny.\n\n3. How long does it take to get the money?\n\nFor straightforward cases, a few working days after approval.\n\n4. Do I need an SBI account already?\n\nNo, but having one makes everything smoother.\n\n5. Can I repay the loan early?\n\nYes, but check the fine print before signing.",

        "full_content": "From lower tax rates to new exemptions, expectations tend to run high ahead of every Budget. This year, however, corporate leaders expect continuity and not change.\n\nAccording to a Moneycontrol-Deloitte CXO survey, which gathered responses from 45 senior executives across sectors, no such changes are expected in the Budget for the financial year 2026-28. The pre-Budget survey shows that 84.4 percent of the respondents do not expect the government to announce any new personal income tax, including levies such as estate duty.\n\nOnly 15.6 percent of those surveyed believe the government may introduce a new personal income tax measure. This suggests that most senior executives are preparing for continuity in the personal tax framework rather than factoring in new interventions. The response pattern indicates that expectations of major changes to personal taxation remain limited at this stage.\n\nThe survey also shows that this preference for no new taxes goes hand in hand witha broader desire for stability in personal income tax rates.\n\nAn estate duty is a tax levied on the total value of a person’s property at the time of their death. The tax became payable when the assets of the deceased were transferred to legal heirs. In India, estate duty rates once went as high as 85 percent before the law was abolished in 1985.\n\nIndia does not levy estate duty. However, over the years, references in government documents and policy discussions have periodically triggered speculation about its possible reintroduction. As with previous Budget seasons, there is renewed discussion ahead of this year’s Budget as well, although there has been no official confirmation of any proposal to bring the tax back.\n\nIf reintroduced, estate duty could potentially add to government revenues. However, based on responses captured in the study, expectations of such a move remain limited among senior corporate leaders.\n\nThe survey was conducted by Moneycontrol and Deloitte between December 2025 and January 2026. The survey included CXOs from across industries such as banking and insurance, manufacturing, transport and logistics, energy, life sciences and health, telecom and tech and e-commerce.",

        "full_content": "Axis Bank’s sharp rally, following its Q3FY26 earnings, has once again altered the pecking order among India’s top private lenders, reviving a valuation battle with Kotak Mahindra Bank that has surfaced only sporadically over the past decade.\n\nOn January 27, 2026, Axis Bank shares surged about 5 percent, climbing to fresh multi-month highs. Kotak Mahindra Bank, by contrast, endured a weaker session the same day, with its shares falling over 4 percent after it reported quarterly numbers that were largely in line with expectations but failed to excite investors.\n\nThe rally helped propel Axis Bank past Kotak Mahindra Bank in market capitalisation, a crossover that has occurred only a handful of times in recent history and was last seen in April 2024, and before that in September 2016.\n\nBloomberg data around January 27 showed that Axis Bank is valued at roughly Rs 4.1 lakh crore, marginally above Kotak’s Rs 4 lakh crore. While the gap remained narrow and volatile, the symbolic crossover underscored how quickly investor preferences can shift on earnings delivery.\n\nMomentum extends into January 28\n\nOn January 28, Axis Bank’s stock continued its positive momentum, rising approximately 3.1 percent and was trading around Rs 1,352 on the NSE at 10:30 am.\n\nKotak Mahindra Bank, meanwhile, was relatively subdued, with its shares trading around Rs 1,505, up about Rs 1.50 or 0.37 percent, significantly underperforming Axis Bank.\n\nAxis Bank’s stock climbed as high as Rs 1,325.60 on January 27, extending gains amid heavy volumes after the bank reported a standalone net profit of Rs 6,490 crore, up year on year (YoY), supported by a 5 percent rise in net interest income (NII) to Rs 14,287 crore.\n\nThe earnings beat triggered a flurry of positive analyst responses.\n\nAccording to analyst reports from IIFL and Motilal Oswal, despite margin pressures seen across the sector due to higher funding costs, Axis managed to hold its net interest margin (NIM) at 3.64 percent, reassuring investors about its balance-sheet resilience.\n\nCiti upgraded Axis Bank to ‘Buy’ and raised its price target to Rs 1,463, citing strong core earnings momentum and improving return ratios, while Bernstein reiterated an Outperform rating with a Rs 1,480 target.\n\nMoreover, according to consensus data on Bloomberg, nearly 44 out of 50 analysts tracking the stock now recommend a Buy, marking a clear shift from the more mixed buy-hold stance that has prevailed since early 2022.\n\nAnalysts pointed to Axis Bank’s consistent execution, steady loan growth and controlled credit costs as reasons for the re-rating.\n\nKotak, on the other hand, posted a 5 percent YoY rise in NII to Rs 7,565 crore, while standalone net profit grew a modest 4 percent to Rs 3,446 crore. Margins remained healthy at 4.54 percent, among the best in the sector, but higher operating expenses, particularly employee costs linked to the implementation of the new Labour Code, weighed on profitability and investor sentiment.\n\nValuation has also emerged as a sticking point for Kotak.\n\nAt current levels, the bank trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of about 21–22, significantly higher than Axis Bank’s 15-16 times, a premium that some brokerages such as IIFL and Motilal Oswal have questioned amid slower earnings momentum.\n\nThe January 2026 crossover, however, is not the first time Axis Bank has overtaken Kotak in market value.\n\nA similar episode played out in April 2024, when Axis replaced Kotak as one of India’s most valued private lenders after Kotak’s stock plunged following regulatory action by the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nAt the time, the RBI had restricted Kotak from onboarding customers digitally and issuing credit cards, citing repeated failures to address serious deficiencies in its IT systems. Kotak shares fell as much as 11 percent in a single session, eroding nearly Rs 40,000 crore in market value and dragging its market capitalisation down to about Rs 3.3 lakh crore, while Axis stood around Rs 3.5 lakh crore.\n\nThat 2024 episode was significant not just for the ranking shift but also for its historical resonance.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg data, the last time Axis Bank was valued higher than Kotak Mahindra Bank before 2024 was in September 2016, nearly eight years earlier. The rout in Kotak’s stock at that time resulted in an estimated $1.2-billion erosion in the wealth of founder Uday Kotak, who holds about 25.9 percent stake in the bank.\n\nMid-sized bank battle intensifies\n\nThe renewed Axis–Kotak crossover in January 2026 comes against the backdrop of a broader recovery in the Indian banking sector.\n\nCredit growth has remained firm, asset quality has continued to improve, and balance sheets are far healthier than in previous cycles, an analyst told Moneycontrol.\n\nHowever, the analyst added that banks are also grappling with rising funding costs, intense competition for deposits and the need to repriceloanscarefully to protect margins.\n\n\"In this environment, earnings consistency and execution have become critical differentiators,\" the analyst said.\n\nThe current market-cap tussle also reflects a broader theme playing out in the Indian banking landscape, with the intensifying battle for supremacy in the mid-sized bank segment.\n\nWhile the pecking order at the top, led by HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, has remained largely stable, competition below that tier has been fluid.\n\nAccording to a Moneycontrol analysis, Kotak has consolidated its position among mid-sized lenders over the years, but the renewed challenge from Axis highlights how leadership in this segment remains contingent on earnings execution.",

        "full_content": "India Inc is turning optimistic about the growth outlook despite lingering global risks and policy uncertainty, according to the latest Moneycontrol-Deloitte pre-Budget Survey of about 50 CXOs.\n\nNearly one in five respondents in the pre-Budget survey expect India’s economy to grow above 7 percent in FY27, a sharp improvement from last year when only a small fraction of corporate leaders were extremely optimistic about growth.\n\nIn the current survey, 19.6 percent of CXOs said they were “extremely optimistic”, while another 50 percent expect GDP growth in the 6.5–7 percent range.\n\nThe share of pessimistic respondents has also dropped sharply. Only 6.5 percent of CXOs now expect growth to slip below 6 percent, compared with 15.6 percent in the previous year’s survey, pointing to improving confidence in the domestic macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe government expect the Indian economy to grow 7.3 percent this fiscal year compared with 6.5 percent projected at the start of the year.\n\nThe World Bank and IMF now estimate the economy will grow around 6.5 percent next fiscal year.\n\nPhysical and digital infrastructure, a young and skilled workforce, and innovation and R&D factors were the primary drivers of growth over the next three years, according to CXOs.\n\nConfidence is also visible in investment intentions. A significant proportion of companies plan to increase capital expenditure, technology upgrades and AI integration over the next 12 months, while hiring and R&D spending are expected to remain broadly supportive. Physical and digital infrastructure, manufacturing push and FTAs were cited as key drivers that could support India’s growth over the next three years.\n\nThat said, risks remain firmly on the radar. Geopolitical conflicts and trade fragmentation were ranked as the biggest global threats to business, followed by concerns over a global economic slowdown and cybersecurity risks. On the domestic front, policy uncertainty and slow reforms emerged as the top concern, ahead of infrastructure constraints and delays in trade agreements.\n\nIndia, on January 27, announced the finalisation of a trade deal with the European Union, one of the eight signed in recent times.\n\nCXOs also flagged rising protectionism, volatile capital flows and energy price shocks as medium-term risks that could weigh on growth momentum if global conditions worsen.\n\nMore than 83 percent noted that the Budget should try to address these constraints, a fact also mentioned in the economists survey conducted by Moneycontrol last week.\n\nOn the domestic front, there were uncertainties with regard to labour codes as well, with 35 percent respondents expecting costs to weigh on benefits from compliance simplification and another 17 percent unclear of the impact of newly notified codes.\n\nOn the investment front, CXOs again highlighted the need for simpler tax regimes, single-window clearances, and faster disposal of judicial cases as factors that could help attract investment.\n\nThe outlook appears bright on the interest rate side as well, with over two-thirds of respondents expecting the central bank to cut rates in FY27. The Reserve Bank of India has cut rates by 125 basis points since the start of 2025, bringing the policy rate to 5.25 percent.\n\nOver half of the respondents were confident in policymakers controlling inflation below the RBI’s target rate of 4 percent. India’s inflation is likely to average around 2 percent this fiscal, with the IMF projecting 4 percent inflation in the coming fiscal.\n\nLong-term policy reforms needed on AI\n\nThe CXOs highlighted the need to create a comprehensive long-term policy framework and promote and support R&D for India to become a semiconductor technology hub.\n\nOver 53 percent of respondents expect significant disruption emanating from AI adoption.",

As part of the divestment, ABB IN incorporated ABB Robotics India Private Limited (“INRBT”) as a wholly owned subsidiary and proposes to transfer its Robotics business to INRBT on a slump-sale basis for a consideration of Rs15.7bn. ABB IN then will sell its entire stake in INRBT to ARSAG. The transaction is expected to be completed by 27 February 2026. In our view, the deal is value-accretive for ABB IN, implied at ~2.2x EV/TTM sales and ~24.4x EV/TTM EBIT (inc. other income). The divestment is likely to sharpen the company’s focus on its core portfolio and support at least 10-15bps improvement in EBIT margins in CY26E and CY27E. Additionally, the exit should marginally enhance return ratios, driven by the elimination of negative net capital employed in the Robotics business.\n\nThe stock is currently trading at a PE of 53.3x/45.9x on CY26/27E.

        "full_content": "India’s crypto sector is seeking capital gains tax rationalisation and re-evaluation of the 1\n\npercent tax deducted at source (TDS)  on every exchange transaction in the Union Budget for 2026-2027.\n\nIt’s going to be more than four years since the 30 percent virtual digital asset (VDA) tax on gains and 1 percent TDS were  levied on  crypto asset transactions, decimating trading volumes on exchanges by over 80 percent. The industry is expecting a revision of these taxes in the Union Budget to catch up with the global crypto sector that had hit an inflection point in 2025, with regulatory movement in the US with the passing of stablecoin-focused Genius Act, followed by a massive Bitcoin rally.\n\nAccording to Dilip Chenoy, Chairman, Bharat Web3 Association (BWA), the current tax regime has no provision for loss set-off, and a one percent TDS on every transaction has reduced onshore liquidity and shifted a significant share of trading to offshore platforms outside effective Indian regulatory oversight.\n\n“This has weakened compliant domestic exchanges and reduced regulatory visibility,” he said, quite contrary to the government’s very perception of implementing TDS for traceability and transparency of crypto asset movements.\n\nChenoy sees Budget 2026-27 as an opportunity to correct these distortions. “The current tax design affects the broader blockchain ecosystem, pushes investment and activity offshore, and limits India’s ability to retain innovation, employment, and accountable growth in the sector\".\n\nIndustry demands expanding of TDS threshold\n\nAshish Singhal, Co-founder, CoinSwitch, one of the largest crypto investment platforms in the country, is hoping for a reduction in TDS on VDA transactions from 1 percent to 0.01 percent.\n\nSinghal said, “Raising the TDS threshold to Rs 5 lakh would help protect small investors from a disproportionate impact.”\n\nIndian exchanges directly deduct TDS on all transactions. At present, the TDS deduction threshold is about Rs 10,000 per year for most categories of taxpayers, individuals and traders and Rs 50,000 per year for small traders and specified persons.\n\nSB Seker, Head of APAC at Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, recommended removal of transaction-level levies in favour of net-revenue generating corporate taxes. “This can improve fairness for retail participants and indicate to them India has moved past the tax-and-deter regime towards a fuller licence-and-supervise one,” he said.\n\n“The way forward lies in pragmatic reforms that bring users back to compliant platforms while strengthening compliance,” said Sumit Gupta, Co-founder at CoinDCX.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by CoinSwitch, taxation is also influencing market behaviour. Nearly 59 percent of respondents have reported reduced participation in crypto investing or trading due to the prevailing tax regime.\n\nAbout 61 percent of respondents are in favour of integrating crypto into India’s mainstream financial taxation system, believing crypto should be taxed similarly to equities or mutual funds. Over 80 percent of the survey respondents want crypto regulations.\n\nWhat was the crypto regulatory update by Finance Ministry?\n\nEarlier this month, the Finance Ministry’s Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)issued updated guidelinesto tighten business operation practices, cybersecurity disclosures and KYC norms for VDA companies registering in India.\n\nAs per the updated guidelines, crypto platforms now have to do more than just allow simple document uploads. Users must take a“live selfie”using software that verifies their presence, typically through eye-blinking or head movement to prevent the use of static photos or deepfakes.\n\nExchanges must record the exact latitude and longitude, date, timestamp, and IP address from which a user starts creating an account.\n\nBinance’s Seker said such regulatory clarity will, in turn, attract more responsible capital. “Clear, consistent operating standards for VDA platforms, aligned with India’s AML/KYC and investor protection priorities, will encourage responsible capital investment, create skilled jobs, and build domestic capabilities,” he said.",

You can email your queries to askwalletwise@nw18.com, and we will try to get a top financial expert to address.\n\nI have bought Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) 2020-21 Series-X subscriptions in my name and in the name of my HUF. The RBI has announced that investors can redeem these bonds from January 19, 2026, after the completion of the fifth year of subscription. With the recent surge in gold prices, I have decided to avail of the early redemption, instead of waiting for the completion of its original tenure of eight years. What are the tax implications if I avail the early redemption window?\n\nExpert’s Advice: Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGB) were issued by the Government of India to conserve foreign exchange and at the same time, offer investors an opportunity to invest in gold. The original tenure of the SGB is eight years but investors can tender their bonds for early redemption after five years of issuance on the half-yearly due date for interest payment.\n\nThe redemption rate of the SGB is announced by the RBI using the simple average of the closing price of 999 purity gold as published by the Indian Bullion and Jewellers Association for the three business days preceding the redemption date.\n\nCapital gains accrue when a capital asset is sold or transferred. The income tax law provides that the redemption of SGB with RBI by an individual investor shall not be treated as a transfer for computing capital gains. This applies not only to redemption on maturity but also to early redemption after five years.\n\nSince this is not treated as a transfer for income-tax purposes, the whole of the redemption proceeds will come tax-free in the hands of investments made in your individual name. The provision of not treating the redemption of SGB with RBI as a transfer is applicable only for an individual investor, and thus the exemption extends only to the individual investor.\n\nTherefore, you will have to pay long-term capital gains tax at 12.5 percent on the difference between the redemption price and issue price of the investment made in the name of your HUF.",

        "full_content": "While Indian equity markets grapple with their own challenges—foreign investor exodus amid disappointing corporate earnings—a far more serious issue is unfolding in global currency markets. The Japanese yen's decline threatens to add volatility across equity markets worldwide. History suggests that unless this currency crisis is arrested, investors should brace for heightened turbulence and accelerated selling pressure.\n\nUnderstanding yen intervention\n\nAt the heart of this crisis lies the question of government intervention in currency markets. Yen intervention occurs when the Japanese government, typically through the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance, actively buys or sells yen in foreign exchange markets to influence its value. The goal is to prevent excessive currency movements that could damage the Japanese economy—a very weak yen inflates import costs and drives up inflation, while an overly strong yen undermines exporters by making Japanese goods less competitive globally.\n\nHistorically, Japan intervened to weaken the yen when it became too strong. However, the playbook changed dramatically from 2022 to 2024. As the Bank of Japan maintained ultra-low interest rates while the Federal Reserve and other central banks aggressively hiked rates, investors fled to higher-yielding currencies, sending the yen plummeting to multi-decade lows. Japan was forced to reverse course, intervening to support rather than suppress its currency.\n\nThroughout 2024, Japan conducted four separate interventions whenever the yen approached or breached 160 per dollar, collectively spending nearly $100 billion to prop up the currency. The market response was violent and immediate.\n\nWhen Japan intervened in late April and early May 2024, deploying a record $36.9 billion in yen purchases on April 29, the Nikkei 225 plunged 12 percent. By July 11, the index had fallen 27% from its peak, illustrating how yen strengthening creates immediate headwinds for Japan's export-heavy economy.\n\nThe most dramatic episode came in early August 2024, not from intervention alone but from the Bank of Japan's rate hike and the subsequent unwinding of yen carry trades. On August 5, Japan's Topix and Nikkei 225 indexes crashed more than 12%—the steepest single-day drop since 1987. Global markets followed suit, though with smaller percentage declines. The cryptocurrency sector bore the brunt, with most coins recording losses up to 20 percent.\n\nYet the recovery proved equally swift. Within 24 hours, the Nikkei surged 10.2 percent as the Bank of Japan signalled it wouldn't raise rates further amid market instability. This whipsaw action underscored the short-term, violent nature of yen intervention's impact, even as markets generally discount these events before they occur.\n\nFast forward to January 2025, and the same dangerous dynamics are reappearing. The yen approached 159.225 on January 23 before sharp warnings from Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi triggered a pullback to 155.6. The pair fell further to 154.2 on January 26—its lowest level since mid-November. But the relief was short-lived as the currency has since rebounded toward 160, with analysts predicting it could reach this critical threshold within days if weakness continues.\n\nThe market received an unprecedented signal on January 24 when the Federal Reserve Bank of New York contacted financial institutions about the yen's exchange rate—a move typically seen as a precursor to intervention and potential coordinated US-Japan action. This sparked the biggest one-day yen rally since August. As analysts warn, when the US Treasury starts making calls, it signals that the situation has escalated beyond a normal foreign-exchange story.\n\nFor now, intervention fears alone have pushed the yen off 18-month lows, offering temporary relief to Japanese policymakers concerned about the currency's inflationary impact.\n\nPolitical and economic headwinds\n\nThe timing couldn't be worse for Japanese authorities. With snap elections scheduled for February, the 160 level has become a politically charged crisis indicator that resonates with Japanese voters, according to local media. The bond market reflects this stress—the 40-year JGB yield broke 4% on January 20 for the first time since 1995, while 30-year yields hit 3.875%, both at historic highs. Meanwhile, traders hold record-high short positions in the yen, making the market vulnerable to a violent squeeze.\n\nCompounding the challenge, nearly all ruling and opposition parties are calling for tax cuts ahead of the election, a stance that adds pressure on the yen.\n\nThe critical question is whether intervention can actually stabilise markets. Analysts remain deeply sceptical. They warn that intervention without supporting policy changes will likely prove ineffective, potentially even allowing traders to build larger short positions within hours. The real solution, they argue, requires a Bank of Japan rate hike, potentially at the upcoming meeting.\n\nAccording to a DBS report, the Bank of Japan is behind the curve in normalising monetary policy, while the government has fallen short of its debt consolidation targets. Yet the broader economy shows resilience—public debt concerns arise amid an economy experiencing vibrant private capital-market activity for the first time in decades, with flourishing M&A activity and a soaring domestic stock market. Japan's public sector debt remains a source of concern, but economic momentum appears unlikely to be derailed. Still, the yen's overshooting may require intervention, especially given the risk of antagonising the United States.\n\nThe limits of US-Japan coordination\n\nDespite signs of coordination between Washington and Tokyo, analysts doubt this represents a lasting solution. Shota Ryu, FX strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, observes: \"In reality, the US probably doesn't want to buy a currency like the yen that has seen its value depreciate for five straight years. Washington could possibly cooperate with one small intervention. But it won't help in a way that could have a lasting effect in turning around the yen's downtrend.\"\n\nThe constraints are mutual. Japan would need to sell portions of its US Treasury holdings to sustain its yen-buying intervention—a move that could push up US yields, something Washington would oppose amid current market volatility. As Takuya Kanda, analyst at Gaitame.com Research Institute, notes: \"It's unlikely the US, worried about global de-dollarisation, will conduct direct dollar-selling intervention.\"\n\nPerhaps the most significant threat lies in what another round of intervention could trigger. A rise in interest rates risks another unwinding of yen carry trades, potentially recreating the August 2024 market chaos. The rapid unwinding demonstrated how a single policy change in Japan can send profound ripples across interconnected global markets, with investors worldwide experiencing significant losses.\n\nThe Japanese government must navigate between allowing inflationary currency weakness and triggering market chaos through heavy-handed intervention. Without genuine monetary policy normalisation from the Bank of Japan, any intervention risks becoming a costly, temporary Band-Aid.\n\nWhether through coordinated intervention, interest rate hikes, or market forces alone, resolution appears inevitable. The question is not if but when—and at what cost to global financial stability. Investors would be wise to monitor the 160 level closely, as a breach could mark the beginning of another turbulent chapter in the ongoing yen crisis, with reverberations felt far beyond Tokyo's trading floors.",

        "full_content": "The shares of state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) andOil Indiajumped up to 10 percent in trade on January 28, tracking the sharp rise in oil prices. This comes amid supply concerns after a severe winter storm disrupted US crude output and exports.\n\nAdditionally, rising tensions in the Middle East also supported oil prices. Brent crude futures rose 33 cents to $67.90 a barrel, while WTI Crude futures gained 42 cents to trade at $62.81 per barrel, as seen at 11 am.\n\nThe two stocks were among the top gainers on the Nifty Oil & Gas index, which was up more than 3 percent at 11,735.55.\n\nOil extended gains as analysts estimated that US producers lost up to 2 million barrels per day or roughly 15 percent of national output over the weekend as the storm strained energy infrastructure and power grids.\n\nCrude and liquefied natural gas exports from U.S. Gulf Coast ports tumbled to zero on Sunday, Reuters quoted ship tracking service Vortexa as saying. The report added that Toshitaka Tazawa, an analyst at Fujitomi Securities, said that a loss of production in Kazakhstan is also underpinning the rally in oil prices.\n\n\"But once supply fears ease, selling pressure is likely to return,\" Tazawa added. He further said that an estimated global crude supply surplus this year amid geopolitical risks, including the Middle East tensions, could keep WTI trading around $60 a barrel for now.\n\nTensions between US and Iran are also supporting oil prices. Reuters reported citing sources that a US aircraft carrier and supporting warships have arrived in the Middle East. This has raised the prospect of US President Donald Trump following through on his threat to attack Iran's senior leadership in response to the violent crackdown on nationwide protests, said ANZ analysts in a note.\n\nONGC shares jumped more than 7 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 266.2 apiece. Earlier yesterday, ONGC announced that it entered into Ship Building Contracts (SBCs) with South Korea’s Samsung Heavy Industries for the construction of two state-of-the-art Very Large Ethane Carriers (VLEC).\n\n“ONGC and MOL Japan have set up two joint venture companies, Bharat Ethane One IFSC Pvt. Ltd. and Bharat Ethane Two IFSC Pvt. Ltd., in GIFT City, Gujarat, with each company owning and operating one VLEC. These vessels will support the transportation of about 600 KTPA of ethane for OPaL, a subsidiary of ONGC,” the company said in a press release.\n\nThe VLECs will be Indian-flag, with a cargo capacity of one lakh cubic meters each, it added.\n\nONGC shares have gained nearly 9 percent in the past five days, and more than 12 percent in the past one month.\n\nOil India shares jumped nearly 10 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 492 apiece. The stock has gained more than 11 percent in the past five days, and over 18 percent in the past one month.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

It opened gap-up with a gain of 2.45 percent and added to the momentum seen over the past two sessions. The shares of the largecap company have gained nearly 7 percent in the last two days.\n\nOn Tuesday,Axis Bankshares surged 4.59 percent to close at Rs 1,315.80, marking the biggest single-day percentage rise for the stock in the past 15 months.\n\nAccording to analysts at Centrum, Axis Bank’s quarterly performance exceeded expectations, driven by strong fee income momentum and improving cost-to-income dynamics, which should ease concerns around margin compression. Emkay Research raised its price target on the stock to Rs 1,475 from Rs 1,400, citing attractive valuations.\n\nThe company’s market capitalisation rose by Rs 7,126.82 crore to Rs 4,15,529.26 crore on Wednesday, compared with Rs 4,08,185.06 crore in the previous session.\n\nAxis Bank on Monday reported a 4 percent increase in net profit to Rs 7,010.65 crore for the December quarter, compared with Rs 6,742.99 crore in the year-ago period. On a standalone basis, profit rose to Rs 6,489.57 crore from Rs 6,303.77 crore a year earlier.\n\nThe lender’s net interest income grew 5 percent to Rs 14,287 crore, supported by a 14 percent rise inloans,though net interest margin declined by 29 basis points to 3.64 percent.\n\nChief Executive Officer and Managing Director Amitabh Chaudhry said the bank’s ambition remains unchanged and it aims to outpace system growth in a sustainable manner.\n\nThe gross non-performing assets ratio improved to 1.40 percent from 1.46 percent in the preceding quarter. Provisions increased to Rs 2,245.92 crore from Rs 2,155.63 crore in the year-ago period.\n\nThe sharp rise in the Axix Bank shares also led to a rub-off effect as the Bank Nifty advanced to a high of 59,659.15.Yes Bankand HDFC Bank were among the other top two gainers, rising up to 2 percent.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "The gems and jewellery sector is a key contributor to India’s economy, supporting around 5 million livelihoods and boosting exports. Following last year’s reduction in gold import duty, the industry expects policy continuity in the upcoming Budget, with possibilities for further calibrated cuts.\n\n\"Measures such as duty rationalisation on precious metals, export facilitation, improved access to raw materials through special notified zones and rationalisation of taxes on making charges can boost consumer demand, formalisation, and global competitiveness,\" Malabar Group chairman MP Ahammad said.\n\nGJEPC chairman Kirit Bhansali said that the global gem and jewellery trade is undergoing a major transformation. With high US tariffs, evolving consumer preferences, and shifting global supply chains, it is imperative that India maintains its competitive edge.\n\n\"Our pre-Budget proposals are focused on making Indian exports more cost-efficient, strengthening SEZ operations, and improving policy frameworks that encourage investment and skill development,” Bhansali said.\n\nA key objective is also to establish India as a global diamond trading hub, complementing its position as the world’s leading cutting and polishing centre. With supportive reforms and a stable trade ecosystem, India can not only weather current global challenges but also lead the next phase of growth in the international jewellery market, he said.\n\nGold also holds a special place in Indian culture and savings practices, with households traditionally keeping large amounts in unused jewellery and bars that contribute little to productive use. Promoting the idea of bringing this gold into the formal financial system through gold monetisation can unlock resources for investment, reduce dependence on expensive imports, and ease pressure on the trade deficit.\n\n\"Steps to make the Gold Monetisation Scheme (GMS) more attractive would mobilise household gold that is currently idle, reduce import dependence, and support macroeconomic stability. A growth-oriented Budget that enhances disposable income, eases credit for the trade and continues infrastructure-led development will strengthen organised retail and generate employment,\" Ahammad said.\n\nThe GMS (2015) was a Government of India initiative that allowed individuals and institutions to deposit idle gold (such as jewellery, bars, and coins) with banks to earn interest. Upon maturity, they can redeem it for cash or gold. It aims to mobilise privately held gold for productive purposes, reducing reliance on imports and decreasing storage costs.\n\nTogether, these measures can enhance macroeconomic stability, expand financial markets, and provide savers with better returns, making them key to both fiscal strategy and long-term growth in the Budget 2026.",

        "full_content": "DCB Bank (CMP: Rs 198; Market cap: Rs 6,379 crore; Rating: Overweight)reported its highest-ever quarterly profit of Rs 185 crore in Q3 FY26, marking an increase of 23 percent YoY (year-on-year) despite one-off expense related to new labour code. The bank’s performance was broad-based, driven by healthy loan growth, robust fee income, better margins, improvement in operating efficiency, stronger asset quality, and contained credit costs.\n\nMore encouragingly, the management expects margin expansion to continue through Q2 FY27, assuming no further rate cuts by the RBI. It has guided for a ROE (return on equity) of 13.5 percent in FY26 and 14.5 percent in FY27 — levels the bank has already effectively achieved in Q3 FY26.\n\nThe reported ROA (return on asset) and the ROE for the quarter stood at 0.91 percent and 12.73 percent, respectively. However, excluding the one-off impact of the new labour code, the ROA would have been 1.01 percent and the ROE a healthy 14.1 percent in Q3 FY26, underscoring the underlying strength of profitability.\n\nDCB Bank’s stock has outperformed the sector benchmark (Bank Nifty) and overall market (Nifty) surging 46 percent and 70 percent in the past 6 months and 1 year respectively.  The key question now is whether this rally can sustain.\n\nThe most compelling aspect of DCB Bank is its valuation. Even after a sharp rally, the stock trades at only 0.9x its estimated FY27 book value, making it attractive. While a valuation re-rating hinges on the bank’s ability to sustain consistent performance, several profitability levers are in place that could drive further upside.\n\nHealthy business growth, robust fee income\n\nDCB Bank has maintained steady growth, with net advances rising to Rs 56,600 crore as of December 2025, reflecting a 18 percent YoY increase. DCB Bank aims to double its balance sheet over the next 3-3.5 years, targeting an annual loan growth of 18-22 percent.\n\nMortgages constitute around 50 percent of the loan book as of September end.\n\nDCB’s deposits grew by 20 percent YoY till end December’25, higher than the banking system deposit growth, albeit on a smaller base. DCB’s CASA deposits ratio of 23 percent remains much lower compared to the banking system average.\n\nThat said, it is reassuring to see the bank strengthening the granularity of its deposit base. Deposits from the top 20 depositors have come down to 6.61 percent of total deposits as of December 2025, compared to 15 percent in FY18, which adds stability to its funding profile.\n\nDCB Bank’s core fee income grew a strong 29 percent YoY, driven by robust traction in third-party distribution, trade finance, and processing fees. The management expects this momentum to sustain in Q4, which is seasonally strong for fee income. Over the medium term, the bank is confident of sustaining fee income at around 1 percent of average assets, broadly in line with the 1.1 percent achieved in Q3 FY26.\n\nDCB’s net interest margin (NIM) came in at 3.27 percent in Q3 FY26, up 2 basis points YoY from the previous quarter (Q2 FY26). The management has guided to a gradual margin expansion from here onward till Q2 FY27, assuming the RBI doesn’t implement further rate cuts. The improvement is expected to play out over the next 3-4 quarters as the bank’s long-tenure fixed deposits will mature and get repriced at lower rates.\n\nIn addition to lower funding costs, improved yields are expected to drive margin expansion. Over the past five years, DCB Bank has steadily built its home loan portfolio, which now accounts for nearly half of its mortgage book. Going forward, the bank aims to raise the share of businessloans(LAP), which generate higher yields than home loans, while keeping the lower-margin co-lending portfolio capped at 15 percent of total advances.\n\nThe bank had borrowings of more than Rs 8,000 crore as of March’25, which has declined to less than Rs 5,000 crore as the bank replaced it with relatively lower cost deposits.\n\nTogether, the decline in funding costs and a more profitable product mix should support margin expansion.\n\nDCB Bank effectively controlled its operating expenses aided by a reduction in employee base. Despite the one-off expense of Rs 27 crore in Q3 FY26, the cost-to-average assets ratio remained stable at 2.59 percent in Q3 FY26. Looking forward, the bank expects to benefit from the operating leverage as the balance sheet grows further. The management anticipates the cost-to-average-assets ratio to remain steady in the range of 2.5-2.6 percent and targets a cost-to-income ratio of 60 percent or below in the near term.\n\nDCB Bank’s asset quality improved meaningfully in Q3 FY26, with a decline in both gross and net NPAs. More importantly, slippages fell to an 18-quarter low, signalling better asset quality trends. As a result, credit costs remained contained at just 37 bps—well below management’s guided 45 bps—even after accounting for floating provisions.\n\nThe restructured book eased slightly but remains elevated at Rs 811 crore (1.4 percent of advances) as of December 2025 and needs to be monitored closely.\n\nOverall, DCB bank is poised for a healthy loan growth, margin expansion (assuming no further rate cut), stable cost-to-assets ratio, and a very low credit cost in near to medium term. This guidance is very encouraging and should drive healthy earnings growth in FY27\n\nDespite the sharp rally post earnings, DCB Bank is trading at just 1 time FY27 estimated book value. The valuation can move above 1x forward BV on sectoral tailwinds which along with healthy earnings growth will drive a meaningful stock upside in the near to medium term. Long-term investors should buy the stock.\n\nFollow@nehadave01.For more research articles, visit our Moneycontrol Research page.",

The rebound is being reinforced by strong institutional participation, as public companies continue to add digital assets to their balance sheets,\" said Akshat Siddhant, lead quant analyst, Mudrex.\n\nAccording to Riya Sehgal, research analyst, Delta Exchange, from a technical lens, bitcoin must decisively break above $90,000–$91,200 to shift short-term bias upward, while support remains anchored near $87,500 and $86,000. \"Until a clear macro trigger emerges, BTC is likely to trade within defined consolidation ranges, balancing recovery optimism against macro caution,\" she said.\n\nEthereum was up 1.87 percent, BNB 1.35 percent, Solana 1.83 percent, Dogecoin 1.14 percent and Cardano 0.77 perce.

        "full_content": "With Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman set to present the Budget for FY27 on February 1, corporate India seems to be divided on personal income tax. While a large section senior executives expects continuity, a sizeable number of industry leaders are expecting rejig of slabs to offer relief to taxpayers .\n\nAccording to a Moneycontrol-Deloitte CXO survey, which drew responses from 46 industry leaders across sectors, 34.8 percent of respondents expect a stable tax regime with no changes in either the old or new tax structures, suggesting that the government will prioritise fiscal consolidation and continuity over change.\n\nNearly one in five respondents (17.4 percent) expect a reduction in slab rates under the new tax regime, indicating continued hope that the government may further sweeten the default regime.\n\nAnother 23.9 percent respondents said slab rates could be cut across both old and new regimes, reflecting demands for broad-based tax relief amid rising household expenses and inflation-driven cost pressures.\n\nExpectations around deductions show a clear bias towards the new regime. As many as 21.7 percent of respondents expect an increase in standard deduction under the new regime, reinforcing the belief that any relief, if offered, will be channelled through simplicity rather than exemptions.\n\nOnly a very small fraction expects higher deductions under the old regime, underlining the growing consensus that the exemption-heavy system is unlikely to see any meaningful revival.\n\nWhat the survey signals for Budget 2026?\n\nThe survey suggest that taxpayers are gradually aligning their expectations with the government’s stated policy direction. Since the new tax regime was made the default and was significantly liberalised in the previous Budget with a higher rebate limit and revised slabs, there is little space for dramatic cuts.\n\nRespondents appear to be betting on incremental changes such as higher standard deduction.\n\nAn important insights from the survey is the near absence of expectations around enhanced deductions under the old regime. This aligns with recent data showing a steady migration towards the new tax system, even though around 29 percent of taxpayers still opt for the old regime due to legacy deductions such as HRA, educationloanand home loan interest.\n\nThe survey was conducted by Moneycontrol and Deloitte between December 2025 and January 2026. It includes CXOs from across industries such as banking and insurance, manufacturing, transport and logistics, energy, life sciences and health, telecom and tech and e-commerce.",

        "full_content": "The shares ofAsian Paintstumbled nearly 7 percent on January 28 as brokerages analysed the company's results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026.\n\nThe shares of the paint-maker dropped to Rs 2,451 apiece in the early trading hours of Wednesday. This is the lowest level seen by the stock since October last year.\n\nAsian Paints on January 28 reported aconsolidated net profit of Rs 1,060 crorefor Q3 FY26, marking a 4.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall from Rs 1,110.48 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. This however includes exceptional items of Rs 157.61 crore due to labour code and Impairment loss following acquisition of Obgenix Software Private Limited ('White Teak').\n\nThe firm's revenue from operations meanwhile rose around 4 percent YoY to Rs 8,867.02 crore. Consolidated net sales increased 3.9 percent YoY to Rs 8,849.7 crore during the quarter under review.\n\nMotilal Oswal on Asian Paints:\n\nMotilal Oswal said that Asian Paints delivered a \"lacklustre performance\" as growth delivery remained soft despite a favorable base and multiple initiatives. \"A shorter festive period and an extended monsoon did weigh on 3Q performance and further delay demand recovery,\" the brokerage said.\n\n\"The management commentary on demand recovery was uninspiring, especially after the constructive commentary post-2QFY26. APNT expects volumes to be in the 8-10% range and value growth of ~5% in the near term. That said, management maintained its EBITDA margin guidance of 18-20%, aided by formulation and sourcing efficiencies. We model 10% revenue CAGR over FY26-28E along with ~19% EBITDA margin for FY27/FY28E,\" Motilal added.\n\nGiven slower demand recovery and competitive pressure, Motilal expects the near-term growth outlook to remain muted. \"However, as the paint category enjoys pentup demand, we will be watchful if the recovery pace picks up faster in the coming seasonal quarters. The company is focusing on product innovation, brand salience, regionalization, and execution excellence to negate competitive pressure,\" it added.\n\nMotilal cut its EPS estimates by 1-3 percent over FY26-28E. It reiterated its ‘Neutral’ rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 2,950 apiece, which implies an upside potential of nearly 12.5 percent over the stock's previous closing price.\n\nJM Financial said that the company's Q3 results were marginally below expectation. \"Decorative volume/value growth of 7.9%/2.8% YoY was below ours and consensus estimate, despite weak base, owing to shorter festive (impacted October sales, November/December had better growth) and extended monsoons. Management remains cautious on demand trends – a) sees mid-single-digit sales growth as reasonable in near term led by volume growth of c.8-10% and negative price/mix impact of c.4-5% (similar to trends seen in 2Q/3Q), b) prolonged softness in industry growth seen due to some reduction in frequency of painting/occasion-led painting and consumer shift to other discretionary spends. Moreover, based on current trends the negative mix impact (c.4-5%) is likely to sustain for next few quarters (will percolate into FY27E),\" the brokerage said.\n\nIt cut FY27/28E earnings estimate by 2-3 percent. JM Financial maintained its ‘Reduce’ call on the stock, while lowering its target price to Rs 2,735 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 4 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.\n\nCLSA kept an ‘Underperform’ call on the shares of Asian Paints, with a target price of Rs 1,875 apiece. This implies a downside potential of more than 28.5 percent over the stock’s previous closing price.\n\nThe international brokerage said that the firm’s consolidated revenue growth was 2 percent below forecast, while standalone volume growth of 7.9 percent was in-line with an earlier festive season.\n\nIt cut FY26-28 earnings estimate by 0-7 percent to account for persistence in gap between revenue and volume growth.\n\nHSBC downgraded the shares of Asian Paints to ‘Hold’, and cut its target price to Rs 2,900 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 11 percent over the previous closing price.\n\nThe international brokerage said that the firm saw disappointing volume and revenue growth in Q3 FY26. Relatively weaker retail demand trends could persist longer, it added.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "The shares ofShadowfax Technologiesmade a weak debut on stock markets on January 28, listing at Rs 112.60 apiece on NSE. This marks a discount of 9.19 percent over the IPO price of Rs 124 apiece.\n\nThe company debuted with a market capitalization of Rs 6,509.78 crore.\n\nOn BSE, the shares listed with a slightly lower discount of 8.87 percent over the IPO price at Rs 113 apiece.\n\nListing performance vs grey market estimates:\n\nThe listing has missed grey market expectations. Ahead of listing, the unlisted shares of Shadowfax Technologies were trading with a grey market discount o 2.82 percent over the IPO price at Rs 120.5 apiece. The grey market estimates quoted by the site has significantly fallen from the 12.90 percent quoted on January 15.\n\nAccording to IPO Watch, the unlisted shares of the company were trading flat at the IPO price at Rs 124 apiece in the grey market.\n\nThe weak market debut comes despite the IPO of Shadowfax Technologies closing with1.68 times subscriptionduring its three days of public bidding between January 20 and January 22. Retail individual investors (RII) and qualified institutional buyers (QIB) had booked their respective reserved portion more than 2 times, while non-institutional investors (NII) subscribed 54 percent of their allotted quota.\n\nBengaluru-based technology-led logistics solutions provider Shadowfax Tech moved to the primary capital market to raise Rs 1,907.2 crore through its initial public offering (IPO), which comprised a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 1,000 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of shares worth Rs 907.2 crore by several investors including Flipkart, Eight Roads Investments, Qualcomm, and NewQuest Asia Fund.\n\nThe price band for the IPO was set at Rs 118-124 per share. Investors could bid for a minimum of 120 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,160, and in multiples thereafter.\n\nHow will the IPO proceeds be used?\n\nThe company proposes to utilise proceeds from the fresh issue towards funding enhancing capacity in terms of network infrastructure, funding of lease payments for new first mile, last mile, and sort centres, as well as towards branding, marketing, and communication initiatives, unidentified inorganic acquisitions, and general corporate purposes.\n\nA day before the IPO opened for public bidding, Shadowfax announced that it has raised Rs 856.02 crore from 39 anchor investors on January 19.\n\n\"Out of the total allocation, 3.67 crore equity shares worth Rs 455.73 crore were allocated to nine domestic mutual funds including ICICI Prudential AMC, Nippon Life India, Motilal Oswal AMC, Bandhan Mutual Fund, HSBC MF, Helios MF, JM Financial MF, and Trust Mutual Fund,\" Shadowfax Technologies in its filing to exchanges said.\n\nICICI Prudential AMC was the largest investor in the anchor book, acquiring 1.53 crore equity shares for Rs 190 crore through its four schemes - ICICI Prudential Flexicap Fund, ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage Fund, ICICI Prudential Transportation and Logistics Fund, and ICICI Prudential Exports and Services Fund.\n\nShadowfax is a technology-driven, asset-light logistics company focused on last-mile delivery, express parcels, reverse logistics and quick commerce services, said Mahesh M. Ojha, VP Research and Business Development at Kantilal Chhaganlal Securities. The company operates across more than 2,300 cities and 14,700 PIN codes and serves clients such as Flipkart, Meesho, Swiggy, Blinkit and Nykaa.\n\nThe analyst highlighted that the IPO valuation appears relatively rich, when compared to peers like Delhivery. The business also faces intense competition and customer concentration risks, with a significant portion of revenue coming from a small number of large clients.\n\nAccording to him, the stock may be suitable for high-risk investors given the overall positive industry outlook. Investors with a long-term perspective who have already applied may consider holding the stock, while short-term investors could look to book gains on listing, if any. Fresh investors may wait for price discovery after listing.\n\nGaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk, noted that Shadowfax offers a compelling play on India’s rapidly growing e-commerce and quick-commerce ecosystem. \"With pan-India reach across over 14,700 pincodes and a client roster that includes Flipkart, Meesho, Swiggy, Zomato, and Blinkit, the company has demonstrated strong revenue growth (~32% CAGR FY23–25) and operational scalability through its large gig-based delivery network. Its asset-light model and EBITDA-positive performance since FY24 highlight its improving profitability trajectory,\" the analyst said.\n\nHe however cautioned that investors should be mindful of the risks and structural constraints. \"Margins remain thin, ROE and ROCE are modest, and revenue is concentrated with its top client contributing around 50%. At the upper price band, the IPO implies an EV/EBITDA of ~106x, which is rich compared with peers, suggesting that current valuations already reflect significant growth expectations,\" he said.\n\nOverall, Shadowfax offers long-term exposure to India’s logistics and hyperlocal delivery sector, but the IPO is better suited for investors with a long-term horizon, who are comfortable tracking execution, client diversification, and margin expansion over time, the analyst said. He added that for short-term listing gains, the risk-reward appears balanced but neutral.",

        "full_content": "SBFC Finance’s stock plunged 11 percent on January 26 after the company announced that co-founder Aseem Dhru was stepping down as the managing director and chief executive officer.\n\nAnnouncing the changes, which took investors by surprise, the company said on January 24 that co-founder Mahesh Dayani would take over as MD & CEO from April 1. Dhru would transition to a non-executive, non-independent director role designated as vice chairman.\n\nDhru, who co-founded SBFC Finance with Dayani in September 2017 after leaving HDFC Bank, told Moneycontrol in an interview that he would be around to ensure a smooth transition and time will bear out his decision to handover control to Dayani.Edited excerpts:\n\nStock market hasn’t taken your stepping down kindly. For an investor, it’s impossible to separate you from the company. What do you have to say?\n\nUnlike a lot of other companies, SBFC has always been a professionally run company. We were not promoter run at any point of time and that is how it was built — professionals who came together to with a common objective to build an institution that can outlast us.\n\nBy definition, individuals have finite lives, energies and timeframes. The real test of what has been built is whether it outlasts you, because if you have to keep doing it all the time, then clearly it hasn’t been built right.\n\nNormally what I've seen in financial services is that it has been a challenge to bring about a transition. (With SBFC) I thought that we can do it a little differently where I move away from the role of a player into that of a coach. I can be of help and contribute to the company to ensure that the transition is smooth. The company's fundamentals remain where they are and the numbers will do the talking.\n\nBut as much as we want to say that companies are larger than the persons running it, they are also a reflection of their CEOs …\n\nThere is no doubt that individuals have their stamps, especially in financial services. Unlike in manufacturing or other businesses, like organisations of the scale of Coca-Cola or cement or steel,  even if the CEO is not a very good, the company faces temporary challenges but manages to get by just fine. Somebody else comes and builds it up.\n\nIn financial services it is tricky. The impact of CEO on financial services is very direct and present. The comfort here (with SBFC) is that it is not a call that the organisation is taking because we (the founding team) built this organisation together from Day One. It is just that I had more visibility because of the nature of the designation.\n\nWhat was that tipping point that convinced you that Mahesh Dayani should take over?\n\nIt’s a job which requires extreme amount of passion, focus and energy. You need to demonstrate it on a day-to-day basis. The minute you realise that you are not pulling your weight is when you realise that time has come to give it to the person who can take the organisation forward.\n\nGenuinely, I believe that at this moment, he (Dayani) is better placed than me to take this company forward. I hope the numbers and history will wear me out. I have literally put my money on him! There are many interests in life one wants to pursue, not necessarily within the financial sector.Aur bhi gham hain zamane mein, mohabbat ke siwa. Also, once you get very good at something, it becomes second nature and we become comfortable but then growth stops. Growth only comes from the zone of discomfort, and to that extent, I'm putting myself in a zone of discomfort.\n\nYour departure comes at a time when growth seems to be slowing and the industry is not in a comfortable position. Even larger players are under pressure.\n\nIn finance business, there is always demand. The challenge is to segregate between need and demand. It is just the ability of a customer to repay theloanwhich needs assessment.\n\nIf you read the RBI’s financial stability report, it very clearly states that the small Indian retail consumer is overleveraged. You need to be careful that you don't really tip him off, which is what happened with microfinance and unsecured lending. One has to be careful that in the chase for growth, you don't really give loan to a guy who struggle to repay.\n\nGrowth is a function of what the market is and what your size is. If you're small, then the market size doesn't really matter.  We can decide at what rate we want to grow. The challenge is in setting the culture of the company and what growth it can digest. Cancer also is ultimately growth! We need to be careful of that in all times.\n\nSBFC has moved in the construct of 5–7 percent quarter-on-quarter growth, so that ultimately we build a boring compounding business and not something that is exciting and can deliver great results in good times, and then struggle in difficult ones.\n\nIn 2022, you were one of the first to flag the stress that was building in the retail space. Four years later, we are still talking about it.\n\nIf most of the debt is not going towards asset creation, which is what the RBI report says, that is not a good place to be. When growth has been above the pace that the system can take, it has led to accidents, whether it is credit costs going up or operating costs peaking.\n\nSecondly, the end use of money has always defined the outcome of your loan. If the end use has been productive, the outcome has been better. When the end use is non-productive that’s where the problem starts for a lender.\n\nIt is also about the risk spectrum one is operating in. If I were a bank and operating at the best level of credit risk, the concern is lower because the borrower is a little more aware and has multiple means to repay the loan. When lending to small businesses and individuals at the bottom of the pyramid, they do not have the discipline or the savings. You have to be more careful than others because the customer segment is a vulnerable one. Most Indians are one hospitalisation away from bankruptcy and that’s the challenge.\n\nFrom inception to where SBFC is now, is it a \"mission accomplished\"  for you?\n\nWe set out to build an institution that will create societal value over cycles. It's good where we have come, so far. We are very happy. God has been kind. We couldn't have hoped for a better outcome but the job isn't anywhere (near) done yet. For that satisfaction, I will have to wait a decade at least.\n\nWhat is your next entrepreneurial bug?\n\nNothing at the moment. The focus is just to ensure that the transition is smooth and I keep giving all the support it needs. For me, the salary stops but the work doesn't.\n\nYou also wanted to see SBFC as a small finance bank. Does the idea still interest you?\n\nIt does but the current regulation doesn't allow it. Promoter ownership cannot be more than 40 percent and we are 51 percent foreign owned. Right now the focus is to just build a wonderful NBFC instead of building just one more bank.\n\nA lot of large banks might start looking out for CEOs in the months to come. Would running a bank interest you?\n\nAs they say, never say never but that is not on the horizon or on my mind as of now. The focus is to ensure that SBFC has a smooth transition. Until I accomplish that, I wouldn't feel that I've done justice to either myself or to those who have trusted me.\n\nWould your association continue for another year?\n\nI've not put a timeframe to it but it will take its time.",

The metal surged to its peak performance on Monday, trading at $117 per ounce amid geopolitical tension led by US President Donald Trump, and continued industrial demand.\n\nThe metal's futures price on MCX opened Wednesday's session at an all-time high of Rs 3,80,200, representing a 4.98 percent gain from its previous close. Silver previously hit a record high of Rs 3,69,000 on January 27, 2026.\n\nThe Indian Bullion Jewellers Association (IBJA) pegged the silver price at Rs 3,44,564 in its 18:30 rate session on January 27,  which is an 8.45 percent gain from the previous price at Rs 3,17,705 per kilogram.\n\nSilver rates across India’s major cities showed remarkable uniformity, with only marginal differences due to local taxes, jeweller margins, and logistics costs.\n\nHere is how a kilogram of silver has moved.\n\nOutlook: Will silver continue its momentum\n\nRenewed geopolitical tensions have been a key trigger. The US President Donald Trump announced a 100 percent tariff threat on Canada over a potential trade deal with China and raised tariffs on South Korean autos, pharmaceuticals, and lumber to 25 percent. These developments have reinforced safe-haven demand.\n\nThe Augmont Bullion report, published on January 28, noted that silver achieved $100 and $107 targets and may consolidate before resuming higher towards $120 (Rs 3,90,000). Key support is seen at $103 (Rs 3,40,000); a break could lead to retracement towards $100 and $97.\n\n\"For precious metals this year, the dominant driver has been policy uncertainty under Trump. A fresh wave of first-time investors, especially across Asia and Europe, is aggressively building personal holdings of gold and silver, adding structural support to prices,\" the report states.",

        "full_content": "With Budget 2026 approaching, the insurance industry hopes for a hike in tax deductions, extension of tax benefits to the new tax regime for both health and life policies, and a resolution of the input tax credit (ITC) on GST.\n\nThe industry believes that these moves would encourage households to opt for adequate protection, ensure tax parity for annuity and pension products, and contain premiums if the ITC anomaly is resolved.\n\nCurrently, the old tax regime allows a deduction of up to Rs 25,000 for individuals and families below 60 years of age and Rs 50,000 for senior citizens under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act.\n\nSubrata Mondal, Managing Director & CEO of IFFCO-TOKIO General Insurance, argues that these limits no longer reflect rising medical inflation. “Doubling the deduction would encourage households to opt for adequate protection rather than minimal coverage and support long-term financial security.”\n\nTax analysts, on the other hand, say that the deduction should also be extended to individuals opting for the new tax regime. “Extending deduction benefits to the new tax regime will ensure that the pursuit of a simpler tax code does not inadvertently discourage essential health coverage,” said Shravanth Shanker, Managing Partner, B. Shanker Advocates.\n\nExtend deduction benefits on life insurance to new tax regime\n\nThe Income Tax Act provides tax benefits for life insurance premiums and proceeds received upon maturity or upon the insured's death. Section 80C allows a tax benefit of up to Rs 1.5 lakh on premiums, and a tax-free payout under Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act. However, these benefits apply only under the old tax regime.\n\n“Rationalising income-tax deductions for life insurance premiums under both old and new tax regimes, expanding the threshold for taxing high-value policy payouts, and ensuring tax parity for annuity and pension products could bolster long-term retirement planning,” said Vipin Upadhyay, Partner, King Stubb & Kasiva, Advocates and Attorneys.\n\nTax analysts say that the introduction of distinct tax deductions for term life insurance premiums can be modelled on the additional deductions available for pension savings under the National Pension System (NPS).\n\n“Experts are also pressing for consistent tax treatment of life insurance gain outcomes, noting that traditional policies with higher annual premiums face less favourable tax rules compared with unit-linked contracts,” said Rajarshi Dasgupta, Executive Director (Tax), Aquilaw.\n\nResolve Input Tax Credit anomaly\n\nThe industry is also seeking a resolution to the input tax credit (ITC) on goods and services tax (GST). ITC allows businesses to offset taxes paid on purchases, and insurers say its non-availability significantly increases costs and impacts profitability from policies.\n\nAlthough GST exemptions on retail life and health insurance have eased costs for policyholders, insurers remain unable to claim input tax credits on critical services such as distribution, customer support, and technology.\n\n“These unrecoverable expenses elevate operating costs and eventually translate into higher premiums. The industry is urging the government to introduce a more flexible input credit framework and undertake broader GST rationalisation in Budget 2026 to contain cost escalation,” said Parimal Heda, Chief Investment Officer, Go Digit General Insurance.",

Sacheti is also a general partner and co-sponsor at Singularity Growth, a venture capital firm, and a limited partner in Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal's 021 Capital.\n\nHow will Sacheti and Orra deal look like?\n\nSacheti is now returning to the jewellery industry and is looking to repeat the success he had in the past. This time, Sacheti is likely to team up with Plutus Wealth Management, a boutique proprietary investment firm, to take full control of Orra, sources said.\n\nHow are Sacheti and Plutus Wealth Management related?\n\nPlutus, like Sacheti, is an active investor in Indian companies. The wealth management firm has backed Happiest Minds, RateGain, CredAble and other businesses in India.\n\nPlutus’ Managing Partner and co-founder Arpit Khandelwal and Sacheti have worked together in the past and jointly invested in Nazara Technologies, a gaming and sports media developer.\n\nOrra will now be their next big bet together.\n\nHow much money Sacheti and Plutus will put in together, how it will be split and how much equity each will hold was not immediately clear.\n\nSacheti, Orra and Plutus Wealth did not reply to Moneycontrol’s queries.\n\nWhat is Orra Fine Jewellery and what valuation is it commanding?\n\nOrra Fine Jewellery is a Mumbai-based traditional jewellery business. It clocked a revenue of Rs 1,241 crore and a profit of Rs 6.4 crore in FY25, according to Tracxn, a private markets data provider. In FY24, it had revenues of Rs 1,156 crore and incurred a loss of Rs 11.3 crore.\n\nA business like Orra would be worth four to  six times its revenue, which would roughly translate to a valuation of about Rs 4,900-7,500 crore ($540-830 million), rough estimates by two industry executives say.\n\nIt has about 100 retail stores and plans to scale up under Sacheti’s leadership.\n\n“Mithun has charted plans to scale Orra’s revenues to about Rs 8,000-10,000 crore in 4-5 years from now,” one of the persons cited above told Moneycontrol.\n\nAre there legal hurdles in the way of Sacheti operating a jewellery brand?\n\nSacheti's legal binding ended a few months ago and he is free to operate in the space again.\n\nIn an interview to Moneycontrol in 2023, Sacheti had indicated he would consider running a similar business once his non-compete clause ends. While he had not commented on the specifics back then, he said a non-compete clause which prohibits the founder from starting up again for more than 24 months is “criminal”.",

The question on factors influencing India’s growth over the next three years was answered by 46 respondents and allowed multiple selections. Innovation and research and development emerged as the next most-cited growth factor at 61 percent. Manufacturing-focused initiatives, including the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme and the Make in India programme, were identified by 56.5 percent of CXOs as influencing growth prospects.\n\nTrade, services and MSMEs also feature as growth drivers\n\nTrade policy measures such as free trade agreements and supply-chain integration were selected by 52 percent of CXOs, indicating continued emphasis on export-led growth. Services sector expansion, including exports and employment generation, was cited by 39 percent, while sustained growth in micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) was flagged by an equal 39 percent.\n\nAbout 35 percent pointed to the start-up ecosystem, while foreign direct investment inflows were selected by 30 percent.\n\nEase of doing business and geopolitical issues were cited by just 2 percent each, suggesting these were seen as less immediate contributors to growth over the next three years.\n\nTop five reform areas government should focus on\n\nIn a separate question asking CXOs to select the top five reform areas the government should focus on to drive economic growth, physical infrastructure and logistics emerged as the most frequently cited priority, with 65 percent selecting it.\n\nA demand-side push through income growth and consumption support followed closely at 63 percent. Regulatory predictability and compliance reduction was identified by 56.5 percent, emphasising the importance of policy stability for long-term investment decisions.\n\nInnovation, research and development and deep-technology commercialisation was selected by 48 percent of CXOs. 44 percent highlighted digital public infrastructure and artificial intelligence enablement as a key reform priority, while an equal share of CXOs also cited attracting foreign investment through reforms.\n\nInvestment climate and execution-related reforms\n\nJudicial and dispute-resolution reforms were selected among the top five reform priorities by 35 percent of CXOs. Energy infrastructure and sustainability was identified by 33 percent. Trade and export push and supply-side competitiveness were each selected by 28 percent, while MSME competitiveness and formalisation was cited by 22 percent.\n\nLower down the list were critical minerals and clean energy supply chains at 20 percent, boosting credit uptake and working-capital access at 15 percent, and global capability centres and high-value services ecosystems at 11 percent.\n\n\"Sustaining India’s growth momentum will require a continued focus on physical infrastructure, energy systems and trade enablers, supported by a demand-side push through public spending and targeted tax incentives. Strengthening energy infrastructure and clean-energy supply chains will be critical to both growth and sustainability objectives. Equally important is creating a stable, predictable regulatory environment that attracts long-term domestic and foreign capital, enabling India to integrate more deeply into global value chains and scale private investment,\" one of the respondents commented.\n\n\"Demand has been slowing down, and the government needs to focus on reviving and sustaining it. However, this demand should be met through greater domestic manufacturing and technology products, rather than relying on global companies and solutions,\" another respondent wrote.\n\nThe Moneycontrol- Deloitte CXO survey  was conducted by Moneycontrol and Deloitte between December 2025 and January 2026. The survey includes CXOs from across industries, such as, Banking and Insurance; Manufacturing; Transport and Logistics; Energy; Life Sciences and Health; Telecom and Tech; E-commerce. The respondents are representatives  of  companies across three categories - very large corporates (above Rs 3000 cr); large corporate company (Rs 500 cr to Rs 3000 cr) and MSMEs (Rs 500 cr and below).",

        "full_content": "Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget FY27 comes at a time when external factors weigh heavily on the economy than domestic challenges.\n\nThe most significant external challenge is the US-imposed tariffs on Indian exports. India’s repeated attempts to sign a comprehensive trade treaty with the US have reached nowhere. The additional punitive tariff of 25% is still in force. It appears that there is no visible progress in the trade negotiations, so far, due to many unresolved market-access issues. This acts as a major drag on the economy as the US accounts for one-fifth of India’s total merchandise exports. It also foments trouble for the economy in myriad ways like rupee depreciation, capital flight (FPI selloff and decline in FDI), revenue loss, dip in forex reserves, weakening of balance of payment system, loss of labour and production, stagnant exports, and many more.\n\nThe domestic market has priced in the global uncertainty, which is continuing ever since Russia’s Ukraine invasion, Israel-Palestine conflicts, simmering US-Iran tensions and the latest US–Europe standoff over Greenland. It seems the market has also priced in the near-impossibility of the trade deal in the near-to-medium term due to the US president’s love-hate relationship with India. However, the investors expect a clear fiscal roadmap from the Budget on how to proceed from here.\n\nThe Budget must also spell out measures to strengthen corporate earnings growth, which are vital in bringing back FPIs and re-energize market. For some time, valuation in the domestic market has been high compared to other emerging markets and that’s why the FPIs were continuously selling here and buying in other lucrative markets. The only way to justify this higher valuation is a handsome growth in corporate earnings, which will embolden FPI comeback.\n\nAt this juncture, adhering to fiscal glide path would be difficult for the FM. Probably, it may hover around the current level of 4.4% of the GDP. Or the government may turn its focus on the ‘debt-to-GDP’ indicator, rather than a fixed deficit target, to maintain its fiscal headroom. Fiscal consolidation is important for managing currency and fiscal stability, and crowding in private investment.\n\nBut it must be noted that aggressive tightening will adversely affect public spending and long-term growth. Also, the current fiscal year’s record capital expenditure of Rs 11.21 lakh crore has failed to enthuse private capital expenditure. It shows a deep malaise, signifying an inherent weakness in domestic demand and consumption. Thus, the Budget must finely balance between fiscal consolidation and capital expenditure.\n\nNobody is expecting tax sops this time. Instead, the market expects a favourable tax regime and stimulus to enhance India Inc’s export competitiveness and manufacturing prowess. However, the restructuring of GST rates, reduction in personal income tax, and special export assistance have led to a fall in the government’s tax revenue, which makes the Budget management even more challenging. To compensate this, the FM has to rely on non-tax revenues such as PSU dividends, disinvestment, RBI dividends, and auction of natural resources.\n\nOn growth front, the picture is brighter. India is one of the fastest-growing emerging economies in the world. In the current fiscal year, economy is estimated to grow above 7% despite these hurdles. Shifting global power balances and strategic requirements will force the FM to allocate more funds to defence sector. The big positive is that private defence manufacturers are set to gain from it.\n\nWe can expect more liberalization from the Budget, especially in the banking, financial services and insurance sectors as it is essential for lifting market sentiments and India’s global ambitions. Finally, the Budget’s focus would be on enhancing growth, reviving consumption and stimulating economy against the backdrop of a challenging and pessimistic global order.",

        "full_content": "Many Silver ETFs are trading at a sharp premium to their indicative net asset value (iNAV) these days, highlighting strong buying pressure from investors. The gap between the market price and the iNAV widened throughout the day on Tuesday, pointing to heightened retail demand and speculative activity in the silver market.\n\nFor instance, HDFC Silver ETF closed at Rs 323, while its i-NAV stood lower at Rs 300.  Similarly, Nippon India Silver ETF closed at Rs 318, while its i-NAV stood higher at Rs 327. However, SBI Silver ETF closed at Rs 329, while its i-NAV was higher at Rs 345, indicating the unit traded at a discount to its underlying value.\n\nPiyush Jhunjhunwala, founder and chief executive of Stockify, said, \"If a silver ETF trades above its net asset value (NAV), it usually signals strong investor interest, driven by rising demand for silver as an investment.\"\n\nETF prices can be volatile and often reflect short-term investor sentiment more than the actual movement in the price of silver itself. A surge in retail buying is also a key driver of demand for commodity ETFs, which many investors view as a safer way to gain exposure compared with direct stock market investments.\n\nJhunjhunwala said, “When an ETF's share price is higher than both its indicative net asset value (iNAV) and its net asset value (NAV), that means investors are willing to pay significantly more for the ETF than the actual worth of the silver that it holds.”\n\nThe iNAV is calculated using the current market price of silver and updates continuously during the trading day. The NAV, by contrast, is calculated at the end of each trading session. In normal conditions, ETF prices tend to track their iNAV and NAV closely because of arbitrage activity. When an ETF trades at a premium, authorised participants can create new units by delivering silver to the fund and selling those units in the market, a process that usually helps bring prices back in line with the underlying value.\n\n\"A gap between the market price and the NAV of a commodity ETF may indicate that buying interest is stronger than what arbitrage mechanisms can absorb in the short term. This can create a temporary imbalance in the market,\" said Saurabh Bansal, founder of Finatwork Investment Advisor, a SEBI-registered investment adviser.\n\n“The concept of arbitrage generally allows prices to catch up after short-term differences. However, large swings caused by heavy trading volumes can lead to temporary dislocations, which usually return to equilibrium over time,” said Bansal.\n\nWhen an ETF trades at a significant premium to its iNAV or NAV, it reflects high demand for exposure to silver. Investors may be reacting to market sentiment, inflation concerns or speculation. Because of the relationship between ETF units and the underlying silver bullion, prices may not adjust immediately to changes in supply. This can allow a short-lived premium to emerge, particularly during periods of sharp price movements in the silver market.\n\n“A significant difference from NAV may indicate either a short-term constraint in supply or a high level of speculation,” said Jhunjhunwala.\n\nAlthough this is not a new development, it points to a rise in retail participation. Retail activity in commodity ETFs typically increases during inflationary periods, risk-off phases and times of rapid price growth, similar to what is seen in gold and silver markets.\n\n“Over time, excess buying pressure usually fades and prices move back towards normal levels. However, investors should remain aware of liquidity conditions, the ease of trading in the underlying market, and the long-term behaviour of commodities compared with ETF prices,” Bansal added.",

        "full_content": "As the Union Budget approaches, corporate India appears to be signalling caution rather than clamour for sweeping tax cuts, with senior executives placing greater emphasis on stability, predictability and simplification of the corporate tax regime.\n\nAccording toMoneycontrol'sMood of India Inc survey, which drew responses from 47 senior executives across sectors, 41.3 percent of respondents expect the government to maintain a “stable corporate tax regime with no changes” in the upcoming Budget. This was the most popular response, underscoring the strategic importance of certainty and stability, as companies plan long-term investments.\n\nAnother 32.6 percent of respondents said the government should focus on “simplifying the tax structure”, particularly by eliminating separate calculations of surcharges and cess.\n\nExecutives said complexity in taxation diverts managerial bandwidth and raises compliance costs, often leading to litigation.\n\n“One single rate with no deductions or exemptions; simplification should be the norm to bring more predictability and less litigation. This will attract investments too,” one executive said.\n\nAnother noted that companies should not be “wasting mindspace, resources and capacity” on navigating multiple layers of taxation, arguing that a simpler system would allow businesses to focus on value creation.\n\nMeanwhile, 26.1 percent of respondents favoured a “moderate reduction in corporate tax rates”.\n\nWhile this group was smaller, executives supporting this view linked lower rates to investment revival, capital inflows and infrastructure creation.\n\n“A moderate reduction in corporate tax rates can further stimulate private investment, attract incremental capital inflows, and support long-term infrastructure creation,” one respondent said, adding that it could also improve India’s competitiveness by reducing economic double taxation.\n\nSome executives also broadened the discussion to capital markets, calling for a moderate reduction in income tax alongside the abolition of long-term capital gains tax on equities and equity-linked instruments to boost growth and investment sentiment.\n\nOverall, the responses suggest that corporate India is not pressing aggressively for immediate tax cuts, but instead wants policy continuity and administrative simplicity.\n\n“A stable and predictable corporate tax regime is more important than short-term reductions, as it enables long-term investment planning and global competitiveness,” one executive said.\n\nThe survey results indicate that as the government balances fiscal prudence with growth priorities, India Inc is looking less for headline-grabbing tax announcements and more for a framework that is predictable, streamlined and investment-friendly.",

        "full_content": "Asian currencies gained as the dollar sank to levels last seen four years ago as investors turned cautious toward the world’s reserve currency amid unpredictable policymaking from Washington.\n\nThe Malaysian ringgit, Thai baht and the South Korean won all appreciated in early Asian trading after the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index slid to its lowest since February 2022 during the US session. The dollar steadied after its biggest fall since April. The greenback’s decline had accelerated after President Donald Trump said he was not concerned about the weakening.\n\nAsian stocks were mixed with South Korea rising and Japan falling. US equity-index futures extended gains as the Wall Street Journal reported SoftBank is in talks to invest up to $30 billion more in OpenAI.\n\nThe dollar’s weakness reflects uncertainty over policy from the Trump administration, including threats to take over Greenland and comments that have raised concerns about the Federal Reserve’s independence. That forms the backdrop as the Fed announces its interest-rate decision Wednesday, just as traders turn their attention to megacap technology earnings.\n\n“The Trump administration is taking a calculated risk,” said Win Thin, chief economist at Bank of Nassau 1982 Ltd. “Foreign exchange typically is the leader in terms of showing market discomfort with a country’s policies and economic outlook, so this dollar weakness bears watching.”\n\nThe latest decline in the dollar also follows signs of US support to boost the yen, reopening speculation around the potential for coordinated currency intervention to guide the greenback lower against key trading partners.\n\nReports from traders Friday indicated that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York contacted financial institutions to check on the yen’s exchange rate — a preliminary step that’s often taken before interventions.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s dollar comments added to an earlier slide in the greenback, which reflected a lack of confidence in the US economy partly due to his erratic tariff policy.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Iowa, Trump said “the dollar is doing great.” When asked if he wants to see the currency decline more, he replied that he could have it go up or down “like a yo-yo.”\n\nIn other corners of the market, gold traded slightly below its record high and silver advanced. West Texas Intermediate crude also edged up. The commodities are all priced in dollars.\n\nTreasuries were a touch stronger with the yield on the 10-year falling one basis point to 4.23% ahead of Wednesday’s Fed meeting. The central bank is projected to halt its rate-cutting cycle as a steadier jobs market restores a degree of consensus among officials after months of growing division.\n\nWith the economy still displaying exceptional strength, the Fed’s messaging is likely to emphasize a data‑driven approach to future policy decisions, according to Chris Brigati at SWBC. Also, the tone from this week’s earnings from the so-called ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech companies should be solid.\n\nAround a third of S&P 500 companies by market capitalization report results this week. Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. report earnings on Wednesday, followed by Apple Inc. on Thursday. Alphabet Inc., by far the best performer among megacaps last year, reports on Feb. 4. Results from Amazon.com Inc. land on Feb. 5 and Nvidia Corp.’s on Feb. 25.\n\n“This week is pivotal in setting the market’s near‑term tone as 2026 progresses,” Brigati noted. “History shows that a strong January often frames the narrative for the rest of the year, with investor psychology playing an outsized role.”",

The respondents are representatives of companies across three categories - very large corporates (above Rs 3000 crore); large corporate company (Rs 500 crore to Rs 3000 crore) and MSMEs (Rs 500 crore and below).\n\nA relatively smaller 11.1 percent and remaining CEOs surveyed fell in the \"somewhat concerned\" and \"very concerned\" brackets.\n\nIn December monetary policy, the central bank has revised inflation projection for FY26 to 2 percent from 2.6 percent projected earlier. The Q3 inflation projection was at 0.6 percent as compared to 1.8 percent earlier, and Q4 projected at 2.9 percent as compared to 4.0 percent earlier, and retail inflation for Q1 of the next fiscal is seen at 3.9 percent as compared to 4.5 percent projected earlier, and RBI projects Jul-Sept FY27 CPI inflation at 4%.\n\nOn January 22,Moneycontrolpoll of 14 economists, bank treasury heads and fund managers on RBI policy expectation on rate action in February has found that experts remained divided view on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation projections. This is because, few experts said the central bank may remain in wait and watch mode before revising inflation forecast ahead of the new base year series for GDP and CPI.\n\nIndia’s inflation firmed up in December, rising to a three-month high of 1.33 percent from 0.7 percent in November, government data released on January 12 showed.\n\nEven with the uptick, headline inflation has now stayed below the RBI’s lower tolerance threshold of 2 percent for four consecutive months, underlining how price pressures have cooled meaningfully since the middle of the year.\n\nFor the year as a whole, inflation averaged about 2.2 percent in 2025, making it one of the lowest readings seen in over a decade, helped largely by a sharp easing in food prices.\n\nDecember also marks a transition point for India’s inflation statistics. It is the final consumer price index (CPI) reading under the 2012 base year. Starting with the January print — due on February 12 — the CPI series will shift to a new 2024 base, with an updated consumption basket that includes more items and assigns a higher weight to non-food components.\n\nThe change is significant because the current CPI is heavily food-weighted, with food accounting for more than half of the index. This makes headline inflation highly volatile, as sharp swings in vegetables, cereals or pulses can move the overall number even when non-food prices remain stable.",

        "full_content": "As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, investors are growing increasingly nervous about the possibility of further changes to capital gains taxation at a time when equity markets are already fragile.\n\nThe concern is not driven by any formal proposal, but by the broader market context: volatile equities, sustained foreign investor selling and lingering unease after tax hikes introduced in 2024. Market participants say even the perception that equity taxation could be pushed closer to marginal income tax rates is amplifying anxiety.\n\nThe fear is less about a headline hike and more about structural shifts that could quietly alter behaviour. These include aligning equity gains with income-tax slabs, frequent changes to holding periods, or raising the burden on short-term trades without reviewing the securities transaction tax.\n\nThis debate is unfolding against an already layered tax framework, where investors face capital gains tax, STT and currency depreciation pressures at the same time.\n\n2024 Changes Still Casting a Shadow\n\nBudget 2024 raised long-term capital gains tax to 12.5 percent, removed indexation benefits for new investments and increased short-term capital gains tax to 20 percent. While markets initially absorbed the changes during a strong rally, corrections later in the year dragged sentiment lower and kept the Nifty largely range-bound through 2025.\n\n“When long-term capital gains were raised from 10 percent to 12.5 percent in July 2024, foreign investors were unhappy,” said Tushar Sachde, tax partner at PwC. “Will the government change rates again within a year? The consensus is that it is unlikely.”\n\nStill, with 2026 beginning on a volatile note and foreign portfolio investors continuing to sell, investors are reassessing whether the higher tax burden is beginning to bite at the wrong point in the cycle.\n\n“Foreign investors look at post-tax returns,” Sachde said. “With higher taxes and the rupee moving closer to 92, they’ve effectively been hit on both counts.”\n\nRisk of Sell-Off if Taxes Rise Further\n\nTejas Khoday, co-founder and managing director at Fyers, said the current framework has already stretched market participants. “The system has overshot for active traders,” he said. “Any hike from here could trigger a sharp sell-off because it disincentivises equity investors to stay invested, especially when markets are not delivering returns.”\n\nMarket participants stress the issue is not whether equities should be taxed. They already are. The concern is about direction.\n\nAfter successive changes, investors are trying to assess whether the government sees the current regime as settled or as a step toward treating capital gains more like regular income.\n\n“Frequent tinkering creates instability,” Khoday said. “What markets need is long-term predictability.”\n\nSatwik Jain of Generational Capital pointed to the cumulative impact of overlapping levies.\n\n“STT was introduced in lieu of long-term capital gains. Now you have both,” he said. “Add currency depreciation to that, and post-tax returns get squeezed. Even a directional signal like reducing STT would be taken very positively.”\n\nMarket participants argue layered taxation combined with currency weakness is hurting risk appetite, particularly for foreign investors and active domestic traders.\n\nFrom the government’s perspective, capital gains remain an important revenue source. A large share of gains accrue to higher-income investors, strengthening the argument that passive income should not enjoy large tax advantages over salaries.\n\nAt the same time, welfare commitments and infrastructure spending leave limited room for large concessions.\n\n“There is limited fiscal headroom,” said PwC’s Sachde. “Any relief has to be weighed against revenue considerations.”\n\nHowever, experts warn that aggressive tax tightening could be counterproductive at a time when markets are central to household financialisation, IPO funding and the government’s own divestment plans.\n\nIncremental Tweaks More Likely\n\nMost market participants expect incremental changes rather than sweeping reform. These could include a review of STT, rationalisation between short- and long-term rates or structural simplification without raising headline taxes.\n\n“STT is almost unique to India. It taxes participation, not profits,” Khoday said. “If you want to widen participation, you need to reduce STT and avoid raising capital gains further.”\n\nThere is also a growing call for policy stability.\n\n“Taxation has become a key issue for foreign investors,” Khoday said. “Most countries don’t tax portfolio investors the way India does. Any further increase becomes a deterrent when post-tax returns are already under pressure.”\n\nTrivesh D of Tradejini said even partial relief could help sentiment. “Simplification rather than tightening should be the focus. Reducing STT or easing short-term capital gains could improve risk appetite without distorting long-term investment behaviour.”\n\nMarkets may have absorbed the 2024 changes, but patience is thinning. What investors want ahead of Budget 2026 is clarity, stability and fewer negative surprises.",

        "full_content": "Indian equity markets head into the Union Budget with cautious positioning and rising sensitivity to policy signals. With Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman set to present the FY27 Budget on February 1, benchmark indices remain locked in a pre-event consolidation phase, reflecting a market that is waiting for clarity rather than chasing momentum.\n\nThe Nifty has largely traded in a narrow range amid a volatile global backdrop marked by renewed tariff risks under a potential Trump 2.0 presidency and persistent geopolitical tensions.\n\nDomestically, growth expectations for FY26 hover between 6.5 and 7 percent, while investors are closely tracking how the government balances fiscal consolidation with the need to sustain economic momentum.\n\nThat trade-off becomes even more critical after FY26, when the Centre committed a capital expenditure outlay of Rs 11.21 lakh crore, roughly 3.1 percent of GDP, representing a nearly 10 percent increase over earlier estimates. With volatility already elevated, markets are increasingly focused on execution rather than intent, making the upcoming Budget a potential inflection point for sentiment.\n\n1) Bigger Infrastructure-Led Capex Push\n\nA sharper-than-expected increase in capital expenditure, in the range of 10 to 15 percent, taking total capex to Rs 12 to 12.5 lakh crore, or around 3.2 percent of GDP, with a strong focus on infrastructure, could emerge as the single biggest positive trigger for markets.\n\nTejas Khoday said infrastructure spending is no longer optional. “If the government meaningfully increases capital expenditure, particularly in infrastructure, it can immediately lift sentiment because this is where India’s biggest bottlenecks lie,” he said. “For manufacturing to become globally competitive, capex needs to rise sharply. Without sustained spending on roads, railways, ports and maritime routes, the ecosystem simply doesn’t scale.”\n\nRanjit Jha added that public sector investment often sets the tone for the broader cycle. “When the government leads on capex, private players gain confidence and that’s when markets respond,” he said.\n\nPublic capex is widely estimated to have a multiplier effect of 1.5 to 2 times on GDP, while also reducing logistics costs that remain elevated compared to peers such as China. Strong execution visibility typically benefits cyclical sectors such as cement, steel, capital goods and construction, supporting broader sector re-rating.\n\n2) Targeted Push for High-Growth Strategic Sectors\n\nMarkets are also watching for sharper policy focus and higher budgetary allocations toward long-term structural growth themes. Above-trend spending on defence, clean energy, railways, AI, data centres, manufacturing and R&D, along with refinements to PLI schemes and FDI norms tied to technology transfer, could revive thematic momentum.\n\nVikas Gupta outlined where expectations are building. “Defence, railways, clean energy, infrastructure, housing, AI, strategic minerals and manufacturing linked to technology transfer are all likely focus areas,” he said. “Sectors aligned with these themes tend to see heightened activity around the budget, especially if allocations surprise on the upside.”\n\nKhoday added that innovation-led industries require sustained policy backing. “Incentivising and subsidising R&D can have a direct impact on sectors like IT and pharma,” he said, arguing that targeted support could help companies move up the value chain instead of competing purely on cost.\n\n3) Measures That Put More Money in Consumers’ Hands\n\nWhile capex supports medium-term growth, near-term market sentiment continues to hinge on consumption recovery. Any move that boosts disposable income, whether through a higher standard deduction, modest slab rationalisation or better-targeted transfers, could revive demand across FMCG, auto and retail sectors.\n\nUnlike indirect measures such as GST rationalisation, markets are looking for direct income-side relief that translates into immediate spending power.\n\nRanjit Jha put it succinctly: “If the government pumps money into the hands of common people, demand automatically follows,” he said, pointing to consumption as the missing link in the current recovery cycle.\n\n4) Capital Gains Tax Stability\n\nFor equities, sometimes the strongest positive trigger is the absence of negative surprises. Clear signals of stability on capital gains tax and Securities Transaction Tax, along with any simplification or marginal relief, could play a critical role in sustaining domestic investor confidence.\n\nKhoday cautioned against using capital markets as a revenue lever. “The biggest impediment to growth would be further taxing the capital market ecosystem,” he said. “Adding stress here risks demoralising investors and weakening India’s capital formation engine. Ultimately, it is domestic investors who fund Indian companies, and that flow needs stability, not uncertainty.”\n\nWith foreign investors still selective, domestic mutual fund flows and retail participation have become the backbone of market liquidity. Tax predictability helps preserve risk appetite and valuation support in a market that is no longer cheap.\n\n5) Export and Trade Support Through Customs Rationalisation\n\nAs global supply chains continue to realign, any push on trade facilitation through customs duty rationalisation, export incentives or progress on strategic bilateral agreements could provide a boost to export-oriented sectors.\n\nRanjit Jha highlighted several emerging opportunities, citing growing momentum around EU-India engagement, expanding defence cooperation with the UAE and disruptions in competing export hubs such as Bangladesh’s textile industry. “These are openings India can capitalise on, provided policy support aligns,” he said.\n\nWith global growth remaining uneven, India’s attractiveness as a manufacturing and export base improves when input costs fall and trade access expands. Export-linked sectors such as textiles, gems and jewellery and defence manufacturing stand to benefit both on margins and volumes.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "More than 80 percent of senior corporate leaders surveyed expressed confidence in India’s economic growth prospects over the next 12 months.\n\nIn response to a question on India’s overall growth prospects over the next year, 47 CXOs participated in the survey. Of these, 60 percent said they were confident about the outlook, while 21 percent said they were very confident. Taken together, over 80 percent of respondents expressed a positive assessment of near-term growth.\n\nA smaller segment of 6 percent CXOs adopted a neutral stance, while concerns were relatively limited. Only a small proportion of 8.5 percent respondents said they were slightly concerned, and those who described themselves as very concerned accounted for 4 percent CXOs.\n\nMedium-term outlook remains supportive\n\nOptimism broadly extends into the medium term as well. On expectations for economic growth in FY2026–27, 46 CXOs responded to the survey question.\n\nAmong them, 50 percent said they were optimistic, projecting gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the 6.5-7 percent range in the next fiscal year. A further 20 percent described themselves as extremely optimistic, expecting GDP growth to exceed 7 percent in 2026-27.\n\nTaken together, nearly 70 percent of respondents expect India’s economy to expand at 6.5 percent or higher in FY2026–27.\n\nAt the same time, the survey reflects a degree of caution. 24 percent of CXOs said they held a neutral view, forecasting GDP growth in the 6–6.5 percent range, indicating expectations of moderation rather than acceleration.\n\nOnly a small fraction of 6.5 percent respondents were pessimistic, expecting GDP growth to fall below 6 percent in FY2026–27.\n\n“The Indian economy will grow on account of domestic demand and infrastructure creation. It will withstand external volatility,” one of the respondents commented.\n\n“India has the largest working class and population. The manufacturing, infrastructure consumerism is on a growth trajectory. India is acknowledged globally for its stable political and reliable economy,” another CXO said.\n\n“Overall, growth of 6-7 percent will happen but the quality of growth is a concern,” a respondent wrote.\n\nThe distribution of responses suggests that while confidence among senior corporate leaders remains strong, expectations are anchored around realistic growth assumptions. The clustering of views around the 6.5-7 percent band indicates that CXOs are factoring in steady domestic demand and policy continuity, while remaining mindful of global uncertainties and structural constraints.\n\nOverall, the CXO survey points to sustained confidence in India’s growth trajectory over both the near and medium term. At the same time, the presence of a sizeable neutral opinion suggests that corporate leaders are balancing optimism with caution as they navigate an evolving global and domestic economic environment.\n\nThe Moneycontrol- Deloitte CXO survey  was conducted by Moneycontrol and Deloitte between December 2025 and January 2026. The survey includes CXOs from across industries, such as, Banking and Insurance; Manufacturing; Transport and Logistics; Energy; Life Sciences and Health; Telecom and Tech; E-commerce. The respondents are representatives  of  companies across three categories - very large corporates (above Rs 3000 cr); large corporate company (Rs 500 cr to Rs 3000 cr) and MSMEs (Rs 500 cr and below).",

        "full_content": "Corporate India is preparing to step up investments over the next year, with capital expenditure, technology upgrades and artificial intelligence emerging as the strongest focus areas, according to the latest Moneycontrol Mood of India Inc survey conducted among 47 senior executives across sectors.\n\nOn capital expenditure, 15 respondents (31.9 percent) said their companies would significantly increase spending over the next 12 months, while another 18 executives (38.3 percent) indicated a slight increase. Twelve respondents (25.5 percent) expect capex to remain unchanged, and only two (4.3 percent) flagged any form of reduction, pointing to broadly resilient investment confidence despite global uncertainties.\n\nSpending intent is even stronger on the technology front.\n\nAs many as 13 respondents (27.7 percent) said their firms would significantly increase investments in technology upgrades, while 23 others (48.9 percent) expect a slight increase. Only 10 executives (21.3 percent) said tech spending would remain unchanged, underlining how digital modernisation has become a core business priority rather than a discretionary cost.\n\nArtificial intelligence integration stands out as the most decisive investment theme.\n\nThirteen respondents (27.7 percent) expect a significant increase in AI-related spending, while 26 executives (55.3 percent) anticipate a slight increase. Just eight respondents (17 percent) said investments would remain unchanged, with none indicating a cutback, reflecting how AI is rapidly being embedded into business strategies across sectors.\n\nThe outlook for research and development (R&D) is more measured. While 13 executives (26.1 percent) said R&D investments would rise significantly and 12 (23.9 percent) expect a slight increase, a large cohort of 21 respondents (45.7 percent) indicated spending would remain flat. This suggests companies may be prioritising near-term productivity gains over longer-gestation research initiatives.\n\nOn hiring and talent acquisition, nine (19.1 percent) respondents plan to significantly increase hiring, while 24 (51.1 percent) expect a slight increase. At the same time, nine executives (19.1 percent) said hiring levels would remain unchanged and five expect some moderation, pointing to selective workforce expansion amid automation and efficiency gains.\n\nIn contrast, investments outside India appear relatively restrained. Only seven respondents (14.9 percent) expect a significant increase in overseas investments, while 10 (21.3 percent) foresee a slight rise. A larger group of 22 executives (46.8 percent) said overseas investments would remain unchanged, and eight (17 percent) indicated some degree of reduction, highlighting a domestic-first capital allocation strategy amid geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\nThe survey’s findings suggest that India Inc is entering the next year with cautious optimism, ready to deploy capital, especially in technology and AI, while remaining selective on global expansion and headcount growth.",

        "full_content": "The benchmark indices recouped some of the previous day’s losses, with the Nifty 50 rising half a percent on January 27, but market breadth remained weak. A total of 1,622 shares were under pressure compared to 1,311 shares that gained on the NSE. The market is expected to remain range-bound amid a rising India VIX. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:\n\nAmol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities\n\nIndian Hotels Company| CMP: Rs 651.35\n\nAfter the short-term correction in Indian Hotels from higher levels, the downward momentum has stalled and the stock has entered a consolidation phase over the past few sessions. Moreover, the stock is available near its important demand zone. The structure suggests a revival of the uptrend from the current levels in the near future. For traders, Rs 625 would be the key support level to watch. Above this, the uptrend structure could continue towards Rs 695.\n\nTech Mahindra| CMP: Rs 1,745.1\n\nOn the weekly charts, Tech Mahindra is in a rising channel chart formation with a higher-high and higher-low series pattern. The stock has witnessed a steady recovery from trendline support levels. Additionally, the technical indicator RSI is indicating a further uptrend from the current levels, which could boost bullish momentum in the near future.\n\nFor the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,680 could be the trend-decider level for the bulls. If the stock sustains above this level, a further uptrend towards Rs 1,870 can be expected.\n\nLife Insurance Corporation of India| CMP: Rs 807.8\n\nOn a broader timeframe, LIC has been in a prolonged downtrend and is currently in oversold territory. The texture of the chart formation and the technical indicator RSI indicate that the stock is very likely to rebound for a new leg of the upward move from its lower levels.\n\nFor positional traders, Rs 780 would be the decisive level. Trading above this level, the uptrend formation will continue towards Rs 860. However, if the stock closes below Rs 780, traders may prefer to exit long positions.\n\nAshish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors\n\nAsahi India Glass| CMP: Rs 991.9\n\nOn the daily chart, Asahi India Glass has been consistently protecting the prior day’s low on a closing basis over the past four trading sessions, indicating strong buying interest emerging from lower levels. Additionally, prices have closed above the mid-Bollinger Bands, suggesting a shift in short-term momentum. With follow-up buying, a move towards the upper Bollinger Bands near the Rs 1,030 zone is expected.\n\nAlong with this, the MACD has shown a bullish crossover below the zero line, reinforcing the positive outlook for the stock. For now, a sustained break above Rs 1,000 can extend the rise further towards Rs 1,030, followed by Rs 1,065 levels, while immediate support is placed around the Rs 960 level.\n\nOn the daily chart, JSW Steel has been trading in a broad consolidation range between Rs 1,150 and Rs 1,202 since early January 2026, indicating a phase of accumulation. In the previous session, the stock surged over 4 percent and decisively broke out of this range, also making a fresh record high near the Rs 1,230 level with a sharp rise in volumes, which is a strong bullish signal.\n\nAdditionally, prices recently found support at the 20-day Exponential Moving Average and bounced higher, confirming improving momentum. For now, a buy-on-dips strategy can be adopted for upside targets of Rs 1,280–1,300 levels. On the downside, Rs 1,170, which is an EMA support, should remain protected.\n\nAditya Thukral, Founder & Analyst of AT Research & Risk Managers\n\nMulti Commodity Exchange of India| CMP: Rs 2,418\n\nA falling trendline breakout has been witnessed in MCX with rising volumes. The stock is consistently trading above all its major exponential moving averages, namely the 20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day EMAs. An imminent uptrend has been established with the formation of higher highs and higher lows across all timeframes.\n\nNow that prices are trading above the short-term resistance of Rs 2,400, an uptrend continuation can be expected. Any minor dip towards the support at Rs 2,400 should be considered a buying opportunity, as previous resistance has turned into support.\n\nInfosys has been consolidating within a box pattern formed since December 22, 2025. Now that corrections in the stock are shrinking and an uptrend in prices is still very fresh, a breakout above the resistance at Rs 1,694 could provide a decent upward move.\n\nThe stock is consistently trading above all its major exponential moving averages—20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day—with all the EMAs sloping upwards. A breakout above Rs 1,694 would be a continuation of the established uptrend and would provide an opportunity for fresh long positions.",

        "full_content": "Dutch Uber Technologies Inc. drivers are independent contractors and not employees, the Amsterdam Court of Appeal ruled Tuesday in a long-running dispute between labor unions and the ride-hailing app.\n\nThe individual circumstances of Uber drivers differ too much to determine whether they should all be classed as employees, the court said in a statement. Labor union FNV had argued that drivers, as employees, should be paid according to the country’s Collective Labor Agreement for Taxi Transport.\n\nThe union said it’s “disappointed” by the outcome but “emphatically doesn’t see this as the end of the battle.” It plans to explore the possibility of appealing the court’s ruling and of initiating legal proceedings for individual drivers.\n\nTuesday’s decision overturns a 2021 decision by the Amsterdam District Court which had ruled that the legal relationship between Uber and its drivers met all of the characteristics of an employment contract. Uber had appealed the decision, saying the majority of drivers wished to remain independent.\n\nThe ruling confirms drivers’ “right to work independently and choose when, where and for how long they work,” an Uber spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe case is one of several challenges the San Francisco-based ride hailing app and rivals including Deliveroo and Bolt Technology OU have faced to their business models in recent years. Labor unions in several European markets have argued for more stringent employment rights for the millions of delivery couriers and drivers who get work from the platforms, while the companies warn that stricter rules risk putting drivers out of work.\n\nSome individual countries including the UK and Spain have already implemented tighter legal frameworks for gig economy workers. However, the European Union’s subsequent effort to regulate workers’ rights in the gig economy failed to get sufficient support, leading to a watered-down plan that kept the most important decisions in the hands of member states.\n\nTo determine the significance of entrepreneurship in defining an employment relationship, the Dutch Court of Appeal considered factors including the size of investments made by drivers, their freedom to choose their working hours, their strategy for accepting or rejecting rides, and the risk of liability and disability.",

        "full_content": "India and the European Union have concluded negotiations on a long-awaited Free Trade Agreement (FTA), marking a major milestone in bilateral economic ties. The agreement is expected to come into force by 2027, EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said in an exclusive interview with CNBC-TV18's Parikshit Luthra.\n\n“Very happy to announce that India-EU have concluded talks on the FTA,” Sefcovic said, adding that the deal goes well beyond tariff reductions and is aimed at ensuring long-term economic security for both sides.\n\nUnder the agreement, nearly 96–97 per cent of tariff lines between India and the EU have been liberalised. A key highlight is the automobile sector, where European carmakers will be granted export quotas for completely built units (CBUs), completely knocked down (CKD) units and components. At the same time, the quota available to Indian automotive players will be 2.5 times larger than that of the EU, with a review clause built in to adjust quotas based on market dynamics.\n\nIndia’s sensitivities in agriculture have been fully protected. “India’s red lines on agriculture have been respected,” Sefcovic said, confirming that wheat, rice, maize, milk and the entire dairy sector have been kept completely out of the agreement. “What is sensitive for India and Europe has been kept out,” he added.\n\nTariffs on European cars, currently as high as 110 per cent, will be reduced to 35 per cent initially and eventually brought down to 10 per cent after a transition period. Duties on CKD units will be cut from 16 per cent to 8.25 per cent. The transition timelines for internal combustion engine vehicles and electric vehicles will differ, with tariff reductions on EVs kicking in at a later stage. Sefcovic noted that around 90 per cent of the Indian car market is priced below €15,000, while European car quotas will apply to vehicles priced above that level. On the other side, EU tariffs on Indian-made cars will be phased down from 10 per cent to zero over time.\n\nThe pact also delivers significant gains for Indian labour-intensive sectors. Tariffs on textiles, footwear and other labour-intensive exports from India will be eliminated, with many items becoming tariff-free and quota-free from day one of the agreement’s implementation.\n\nIn wines and spirits, tariffs on premium European wines will be slashed from 150 per cent to 20 per cent, while duties on EU spirits will come down to 40 per cent. Tariffs on olive oil and certain processed food items will be reduced to zero.\n\nOn mobility, a separate memorandum of understanding will expand opportunities for Indian citizens, particularly professionals and skilled workers, to access European markets.\n\nAddressing concerns around the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), Sefcovic said the European steel sector is under strain and safeguard measures will come into effect from January 1, 2026. However, he emphasised that India would be treated as an FTA partner with privileged access. “India is in an excellent position,” he said, promising the “best possible assistance” to Indian companies on CBAM compliance and assuring that “no other country will be treated better than India.”\n\nReflecting on the negotiations, Sefcovic highlighted his close working relationship with Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal. “I had more than 10 in-person meetings with Minister Goyal. Minister Goyal and I became personal friends,” he said, adding that their conversations often went beyond trade. “When teams were stuck, we tried to find solutions as friends at a personal level,” he noted.\n\nThe conclusion of the India-EU FTA is being seen as one of the most significant trade breakthroughs for India in recent years, with wide-ranging implications for manufacturing, exports, jobs and strategic economic ties with Europe.",

The EU, meanwhile, is targeting a doubling of its exports to India by 2032. Once implemented, the agreement is expected to drive growth across key sectors including automobiles, gems and jewellery, electronics, chemicals and pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe deal is also likely to open new employment avenues for highly skilled Indian professionals in Europe, offering a potential alternative for students and workers seeking options beyond the US amid immigration uncertainties linked to PresidentDonald Trump’s policy stance.\n\nHow the legal gateway office will help Indian talent\n\nThe EU chief said that under the agreement, the movement of students, researchers, seasonal workers and highly skilled professionals will be facilitated in line with the needs and policies of individual member states.\n\nIndia–EU trade deal: Wines, olive oil and chocolates set to get cheaper\n\nAn EU statement said the office will enable the use of the EU Talent Pool IT platform to support worker recruitment as required.\n\nWe are launching the first EU legal gateway office in India.

It aims to strengthen exchanges among students, academics and researchers through joint initiatives, including the Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC).\n\nThe EU said it will facilitate recognition of qualifications and overseas learning periods to support deeper collaboration in higher and vocational education, enabling joint programmes, satellite campuses and language training initiatives in India.\n\nIt also said it will back skill development and technical qualifications in critical technology areas, and support mobility programmes under Horizon Europe and Indian fellowship schemes.\n\nIndia-EU FTA opens door to more premium models, not immediate price cuts: Carmakers\n\nAccording to European Commission data released in 2024, Indian nationals were issued around 16,300 EU Blue Cards during the year—the highest number granted to any nationality. These permits are meant for highly skilled professionals seeking employment in the EU.\n\nEU member states also issued about 10,200 intra-corporate transfer permits in 2024, with Indians accounting for roughly 3,300 permits, or nearly 33 percent of the total.\n\nIndians also formed a significant share of first-time residence permit recipients. Around 192,400 Indians were granted first-time residence permits in 2024, placing them among the largest non-EU national groups allowed to live in the bloc that year.",

        "full_content": "The NPS Swasthya Pension Scheme is a new initiative launched by the pension regulator, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), to assist individuals in covering medical expenses through their pension savings. It is initially being tested as a small pilot project within a special “sandbox” system.\n\nThe scheme connects health expenses with the National Pension System (NPS). People can save money and later use some of it for hospital and doctor bills. The goal is to make healthcare support simple, safe, and transparent for Indian citizens.\n\nAccording to the PFRDA circular issued on January 27, 2026, \"The NPS Swasthya Pension Scheme shall be introduced as a specific sector scheme under the NPS, intended exclusively to provide financial support for out-patient and in-patient medical expenses, within the framework of the Multiple Scheme Framework (‘MSF’). The Scheme shall be a contributory pension scheme, governed by the provisions of section 12(1)(a) and section 20 of the PFRDA Act and shall be offered to citizens of India on a voluntary basis.\"\n\nThe scheme will be launched by Pension Funds (‘PFs’), subject to prior approval from the Authority, strictly as a Proof of Concept, for a limited period. It will operate in a controlled environment under the Regulatory Sandbox Framework. PFs may also collaborate with FinTechs and other entities to carry out this Poc. For this PoC, provisions of PFRDA (Exits and Withdrawals under NPS) Regulations, 2015, have been relaxed under the Regulatory Sandbox Framework, in accordance with the PFRDA circular.\n\nThe circular states PFs must ensure all systems, intermediaries, and providers like CRA and HBA/TPA are ready before launch. They must disclose all key Scheme info—benefits, fees, claims, grievances, exit options transparently. PFs, with HBA, can add value-added features for subscribers.\n\nThe key details provided by PFRDA are\n\n1. Eligibility:Any citizen of India can join the NPS Swasthya Pension Scheme. A Common Scheme Account must be opened along with the NPS Swasthya Pension Scheme Account if it is not already existing.\n\n2. Charges:Fees and charges applicable under the Scheme shall be governed by the MSF and disclosed transparently. Such charges shall include those payable to the HBA, per the circular.\n\n3. Contributions:Subscribers are allowed to contribute any amount to the NPS Swasthya Pension Scheme, following the current guidelines applicable to the Non-Government Sector under NPS.\n\n4. Contributions under the Schemeshall be invested by the PFs following the investment guidelines specified in the MSF.\n\n5. Transfer of Contributions from Common Scheme Account:Subscribers (excluding those under the Government Sector and Government-owned Corporates), aged above 40 years, shall be allowed to transfer up to 30% of their own and/or employee contributions from the Common Scheme Account to the NPS Swasthya Pension Scheme Account.\n\n6. Partial Withdrawals for Medical Expenses:Subscribers are allowed to make partial withdrawals from their NPS Swasthya Pension Scheme Account to cover outpatient or inpatient medical costs as they arise. At any time, withdrawals can be made up to 25% of the subscriber’s own contributions to the Scheme, in line with the provisions of the PFRDA Act, 2013. There are no limits on the number of partial withdrawals, and no minimum waiting period is required, provided that the first partial withdrawal is only permitted after accumulating a minimum corpus of Rs 50,000 in the Scheme.\n\n7. Premature Exit for Critical Medical Treatment:In the event of inpatient medical treatment where expenses in a single instance exceed 70% of the total corpus available in the subscriber’s NPS Swasthya Pension Scheme Account, the subscriber shall be allowed to make a premature exit with a 100% lump sum, regardless of the corpus size, solely for covering such medical expenses, per the circular.\n\n8.Settlement of claims:Amounts withdrawn or exited shall be remitted directly to the concerned HBA/TPA, as applicable, based on valid claims and supporting invoices. Any remaining surplus after settling medical expenses shall be transferred to the subscriber’s Common Scheme Account.",

        "full_content": "The India-European Union free trade agreement could significantly widen choices for Indian consumers by opening up a nearly $3 billion food and beverage market to European producers, a Moneycontrol analysis shows.\n\nOnce implemented, the deal would significantly reduce tariffs across a wide range of consumer products, including wine, beer, spirits, olive oil, pet food, and processed foods.\n\nCurrently, many European food and beverage products face prohibitive import duties, often exceeding 100 percent, sharply limiting their demand in the Indian market. The trade agreement proposes substantial tariff reductions or complete elimination across a wide range of items, making European products far more price competitive.\n\nOne of the most visible changes will be in alcoholic beverages. Wine imports, which currently attract duties as high as 150 percent, will see tariffs cut to 20 percent for premium wines and 30 percent for mid-range products. The EU already accounts for over half of India’s wine imports, supplying goods worth nearly $13.8 million out of total imports of $25.6 million. Lower duties could accelerate consumption beyond niche urban markets.\n\nA similar story is expected to play out in spirits and beer. Spirits currently face duties of up to 150 percent, which will be lowered to 40 percent, while beer tariffs will be halved to 50 percent from 110 percent. While the EU’s current share in these categories is relatively modest—16 percent in spirits and 15.5 percent in beer—lower tariffs could help European brands gain ground against competitors from other regions.\n\nPerhaps the biggest impact will be felt in processed foods, which form the bulk of the market opening. Imports of items such as breads, pastries, pasta, chocolates, and pet food, currently subject to duties of up to 50 percent, will become fully tariff-free.\n\nIndia imported over $2.68 billion worth of processed foods, of which EU exports accounted for about $419 million. The tariff elimination could rapidly expand the EU’s footprint in this high-volume segment.\n\nThe agreement also provides full duty-free access for olive oil and other vegetable oils, where the EU already dominates with a 95.5 percent share of India’s imports. Similarly, fruit juices, non-alcoholic beer and sheep meat will see tariffs cut to zero, while duties on sausages and meat preparations will be reduced to 50 percent.\n\nOverall, the EU-India trade deal is expected to open a $2.8–3 billion import market to European producers. For Indian consumers, this translates into greater variety, improved availability and potentially lower prices, while for EU companies, India emerges as a far more accessible and commercially viable food and beverage market than before.",

        "full_content": "NTPC is expected to report a muted performance in Q3FY26, as soft power demand and lower thermal generation weigh on operational metrics.  The power major is expected to announce its earnings for the quarter ending December 2025 on January 30.\nWhile power demand conditions improved toward the end of the quarter, the late recovery is unlikely to materially lift volumes. Earnings, however, are expected to remain largely insulated by the company’s regulated cost-plus framework and incremental additions to its regulated equity base, keeping profit growth modest but stable.\nAccording to a Moneycontrol poll of 6 brokerages, revenue is estimated to rise 7.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 44,525.3 crore in Q3FY26, from Rs 41,352.3 crore in Q3FY25, reflecting steady topline growth. Net profit is projected to increase 6.6 percent YoY to Rs 5,023.7 crore, compared with Rs 4,711 crore in the year-ago quarter, supported by improved operating leverage. The EBITDA margin is expected to expand by about 120 basis points to 30.1 percent in Q3FY26 from 28.9 percent in Q3FY25.\nHere are the key drivers for earnings:\nWeak demand keeps generation under pressure\nPower demand remained subdued during most of the October–November period, before improving sharply in December. JM Financial highlighted that while energy and peak demand rose in December, quarterly energy demand was largely flat, resulting in a year-on-year decline in conventional and thermal generation in Q3FY26. Kotak Institutional Equities also flagged a decline in generation, attributing it to modest power demand, which weighed on thermal plant load factors during the quarter.\nRegulated cost-plus model limits earnings volatility\nDespite weaker generation, NTPC’s earnings are expected to remain relatively stable due to its regulated business framework, under which returns are linked to regulated equity rather than volumes. Motilal Oswal expects ~8% YoY growth in revenue and EBITDA and ~7% growth in adjusted PAT, while Antique noted that lower PLFs have limited impact on profitability under the cost-plus structure.\nCapacity additions aid equity base, ramp-up gradual\nAntique highlighted that NTPC’s installed capacity increased on both standalone and consolidated bases during the quarter, with capacity commercialised on a consolidated basis supporting incremental regulated equity growth. Elara, however, noted that limited new additions in FY26 and gradual ramp-up of recently commissioned projects mean that the earnings contribution from these capacities will accrue progressively.\nHigher hydro and renewable output offsets thermal decline\nJM Financial pointed to stronger hydro generation due to a favourable monsoon and higher renewable output supported by capacity additions during the quarter. While this helped offset the decline in thermal generation, it also led to lower thermal PLFs, reflecting the shift in the generation mix.\nFuel availability and de-risking remain supportive\nFuel supply conditions remained comfortable during the quarter. Antique highlighted ongoing fuel de-risking initiatives and stable coal availability, which helped ensure smooth operations and limited downside risks to margins despite weaker generation.\nWhat analysts will watch\nAnalysts will focus on generation and PLF trends, particularly whether the December demand recovery translates into improved thermal utilisation. Growth in regulated equity and capex execution will be closely monitored, as will updates on capacity commissioning across thermal, hydro and renewable segments. Commentary on fuel availability, coal linkage conditions, tariff trends and the power demand outlook for FY27 will also be key to assessing near- and medium-term earnings momentum.",

According to NSE data, the issue received bids for 24.23 crore shares against 8.9 crore shares on offer.\nAhead of the public issue, Shadowfax had raised Rs 856 crore from anchor investors.\nThe IPO was priced in the range of Rs 118 to Rs 124 per share, valuing the company at over Rs 7,100 crore at the upper end of the price band.\nCheck All IPO News\nCommenting on the issue, Ruchit Jain said Shadowfax is a technology-driven, asset-light logistics company focused on last-mile delivery, express parcels, reverse logistics and quick commerce services. The company operates across more than 2,300 cities and 14,700 PIN codes and serves clients such as Flipkart, Meesho, Swiggy, Blinkit and Nykaa.\nHe noted that while the company has reported strong revenue growth and improving profitability, the IPO valuation appears relatively rich. At around 2.8 times price-to-sales, the valuation is higher compared with peers such as Delhivery. The business also faces intense competition and customer concentration risks, with a significant portion of revenue coming from a small number of large clients.\nAccording to him, the stock may be suitable for high-risk investors given the overall positive industry outlook.

Brokerages remain bullish, with target prices implying strong upside potential from current levels.\nThe shares of the steel maker closed at Rs 1,223.20 apiece on Tuesday. Earlier during the day, the stock jumped further to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 1,230.40 apiece.\nJSW Steel Q3 Results:\nJSW Steel reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 2,139 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 198 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from Rs 717 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. The firm's revenue from operations rose 11 percent YoY to Rs 45,991 crore during the quarter under review.\nThe company’s steel sales grew 14 percent YoY to Rs 7.64 mt, while crude steel production rose 6 percent YoY to 7.48 mt.\nMotilal Oswal on JSW Steel:\nMotilal Oswal said the company’s revenue was in-line with estimates, mainly on account of strong volume, which was partially offset by muted NSR. “Adjusted EBITDA was largely in line with our estimate at INR66b (+19% YoY). It dipped 16% QoQ, mainly due to weak NSR and increased input costs,” it added.\nJSTL reported a decent performance in 3QFY26, supported by volume growth, offsetting muted steel prices. We believe JSTL is well-placed with new capacities coming on-stream, strong domestic demand, and a rising share of value-added proportion in the sales mix. Its focus on increasing the captive share of iron ore and improving coal linkages will support earnings, the domestic brokerage said.\nMotilal estimates double-digit revenue growth over FY26-FY28, driven by the ramp-up of new capacity and price recovery led by safeguard duty. The brokerage reiterated its ‘Buy’ rating for the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,350 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 15 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.\nPL Capital on JSW Steel:\nPL Capital upgraded the shares of JSW Steel to ‘Accumulate’ with a target price of Rs 1,292 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 10 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. It expects the company to improve its market share over the next few years due to its superior execution capabilities, downstream focus and significant deleveraging post JFE-BPSL deal.\n“Q3 performance was tad weaker due to weak steel pricing, shutdown costs and deteriorated product mix on higher JVML contribution,” the domestic brokerage noted.\nFollow all LIVE updates on Q3 results.",

        "full_content": "For many bank locker holders, the importance of that small metal key only becomes clear when it goes missing. What follows is rarely a simple replacement exercise. Instead, customers are drawn into a process that involves paperwork, verification, costs and, in some cases, prolonged waiting at the branch level.\nBanks follow a dual-control system for lockers, where access depends on both the customer’s key and the bank’s master mechanism. Once the customer key is lost, that balance breaks. Banks do not keep spare customer keys, which means the locker cannot be opened in the usual manner.\nWhat should you do once you lose your key?\nThe immediate step after discovering the loss is to formally inform the branch. Most banks insist on a written intimation to record the incident and prevent any misuse. Depending on banks policy, customers may also be asked to submit an indemnity or lodge a police complaint, particularly if the loss raises security concerns.\nUnder the RBI Master Direction (RBI/2021-22/86), the customer has a statutory right to a transparent ‘break-open’ procedure. “Upon the loss of a key being reported, the bank is mandated to issue an acknowledgement and schedule the lock-breaking process in the presence of the customer and independent witnesses,” said Prerna Robin, Principal Associate, B. Shanker Advocates.\nAccess to the locker is restored only after the bank decides to break open the existing lock and install a new one. This is not an instant exercise. Banks usually fix a date, arrange a technician and require the locker holder and all joint holders, if applicable, to be present. The process is documented, and in some cases, an inventory of the contents may be prepared to avoid future disputes.\n“While the RBI does not stipulate a rigid timeline for completion of the break-open process, the regulatory scheme emphasises promptness, transparency and procedural discipline, leaving little scope for arbitrary inaction,” said Tushar Kumar, Advocate, Supreme Court of India.\nWho bears the cost of breaking the locker?\nFrom a legal standpoint, while the financial cost of breaking open the locker and replacing the lock rests with the customer when the key is lost, the responsibility for the process and its consequences lies squarely with the bank. “RBI regulations expressly recognise that banks owe an independent duty of care in operating locker facilities; accordingly, any loss, damage, or exposure of contents arising from negligence, procedural lapses, or deviation from prescribed safeguards during the break-open process can attract bank liability, including statutory compensation of up to 100 times the annual locker rent,” said Vrinda Mishra, Associate, PSL Advocates and Solicitors.\nWhen can banks deny locker access\nBanks are legally authorised to deny locker access only under a specific set of circumstances: “The customer’s failure to sign the revised locker agreement as mandated by RBI regulations, the non-payment of locker rent or related fees, or the existence of a formal court order or legal restraint, according to Alay Razvi, Managing Partner, Accord Juris.\nOnce access is restored, what steps you should follow to avoid future issues:\n• Keep the new key in a safe place that’s secure yet easy for you to remember.\n• Opt for a locker with digital or biometric authentication if your bank provides that option.\n• Maintain an updated inventory of locker contents to prevent any ownership or claim-related disputes later.",

        "full_content": "As Budget 2026 approaches, gold investors are looking for clarity, safety and better alternatives to holding physical gold at home. Despite rising awareness, a large part of household savings in India is still locked in physical gold, often lying idle, illiquid and underutilised from a personal finance perspective.\nIndustry experts see a broader opportunity: mobilising household gold into digital and regulated products could contribute to India’s long-term growth ambitions, supporting the vision of Viksit Bharat 2047 while helping households make their gold work more efficiently.\nGold Prices and Changing Investment Patterns\nWith gold prices at record highs, around Rs 1.62 lakh per tola, Mahendra Luniya, Chairman, Vighnharata Gold says, “Buying large quantities of jewellery has become increasingly difficult for retail investors. As a result, many households are shifting to small-ticket purchases like one-gram gold coins or bars, or continuing to accumulate gold purely as a store of value.”\nHe adds, “While this reflects gold’s importance in Indian portfolios, it also highlights the need for more efficient, secure and financially productive ways to invest in the asset.”\nPhysical Gold and Portfolio Considerations\nFrom a personal finance standpoint, physical gold comes with challenges, storage costs, purity concerns, insurance risks and limited liquidity. “These drawbacks become more pronounced as portfolio sizes grow and investors seek better visibility and control over their assets,” points out Luniya.\nDigital gold and regulated paper gold products address many of these concerns, offering easier access, better liquidity and greater transparency for retail investors.\n“Gold remains a core part of Indian household wealth, but holding it in physical form is no longer the most efficient choice for today’s investor,” says Luniya. “Budget 2026 should focus on encouraging a shift from physical gold to regulated digital and paper gold products that are safer, more liquid and better aligned with long-term financial planning.”\nSovereign Gold Bonds and Retail Participation\nThe Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) scheme played a crucial role in nudging households away from physical gold. For retail investors, SGBs combined price-linked returns with annual interest income, sovereign backing and tax efficiency when held to maturity.\nOver time, the scheme helped change investor behaviour and positioned gold as a financial asset rather than just a physical holding. However, Luniya says, “With the discontinuation of fresh SGB issuances, investors now have fewer government-backed avenues to invest in gold efficiently.”\nHe further adds, “Reintroducing SGBs would be a strong pro-investor move. SGBs helped households earn better risk-adjusted returns from gold while avoiding storage and security concerns. From a personal finance lens, it remains one of the most efficient ways to include gold in a diversified portfolio.”\nBudget 2026: Key Expectations for Gold Investors\nAs Budget 2026 draws closer, industry experts say investors are hoping for policies that make gold investing simpler, safer and more transparent. “Clear regulations around digital gold, renewed focus on financial gold products and incentives that discourage excessive physical hoarding could help households use gold more productively within their portfolios,” suggests Luniya.\nFor Indian investors, gold will always remain an emotional and financial asset. The expectation from Budget 2026 is that it also becomes a smarter personal finance choice, one that supports long-term wealth creation rather than idle storage.",

        "full_content": "The impact of the GST-driven input tax credit (ITC) loss on life insurers seems to be playing out most sharply in the bancassurance channel during Q3 FY26 for both HDFC Life and ICICI Prudential Life, where parent banks continue to account for a large share of new business.\nAt HDFC Life, bancassurance contributes over 60 percent of annualised premium equivalent (APE), with HDFC Bank alone accounting for the bulk of that flow. At ICICI Prudential Life, bancassurance makes up around 25-30 percent of APE, with ICICI Bank contributing roughly half of the channel’s volumes.\nThis structural dependence may be a reflection of why negotiations around post-GST commercial realignment are not just with third-party distributors, but naturally and materially with parent banks, even as insurers expand agency, partnership and proprietary channels.\nGST reset hits banca-heavy insurers\nThe removal of input tax credit following the GST cut has forced insurers to revisit distributor economics, particularly in bancassurance where commissions are a significant cost line.\nHDFC Life said it has completed negotiations across distributors, including banks, and implemented revised commercial terms.\n“Short answer is negotiations were completed, and it’s moved on in terms of what we said that we would do,” MD & CEO Vibha Padalkar said, adding that discussions with all distributors are now concluded and the company has transitioned to the new structure.\nSome of these measures were implemented mid-quarter after the GST announcement in late September. “You’ll see some part of it in Q3, with more flowing through in Q4 and progressively thereafter,” Padalkar said.\nHowever, queries sent to HDFC Life on the details of these negotiations remain unanswered until the time of publishing.\nICICI Prudential Life, however, said negotiations are still ongoing, reflecting the diversity of its partner base, including its parent bank.\n“We’ve got multiple types of partners, and our approach differs across them. Given this diversification, closing some of these commercials takes time,” MD & CEO Anup Bagchi said, during Q3 FY26 earnings call.\nThe insurer clarified that the ITC loss has already been absorbed. “Input tax credit is no longer available and that cost has been taken on the P&L and VNB,” it said, adding that any benefit going forward would come through commission rationalisation rather than ITC reversals.\nParent banks key to growth, and the slowdown\nThe heavy reliance on parent banks also perhaps explains why bancassurance growth has lagged this year.\nAt HDFC Life, bancassurance growth for the nine-month period stood at just 2 percent, pulling overall growth below industry levels.\n“Yes, banca has seen lower growth this year,” Vibha Padalkar said, adding that the softness should be viewed in context. “If you look at the two-year CAGR, growth is reasonably strong, and we believe the channel will continue to deliver.”\nThe insurer expects growth to normalise in FY27 as bancassurance stabilises and proprietary channels scale up.\nAt ICICI Prudential Life, bancassurance grew 10.5 percent year-on-year in Q3 FY26, contributing 26.7 percent to APE, which is a relatively lower number compared to the previous quarters for the company, with ICICI Bank continuing to deliver steady volumes.\nValue over volume amid recalibration\nBoth insurers stressed that part of the slowdown was strategic, driven by a sharper focus on quality and value, especially given the high share of parent banks in distribution.\nHDFC Life said it selectively stepped back from certain non-par opportunities where pricing and quality thresholds were not met.\n“In some cases this quarter, we didn’t participate to the extent we could have because of the commercials and the quality of business we wanted,” management said.\nThe company said it is increasingly tracking counter share of value of new business (VNB) at key partners like HDFC Bank rather than chasing topline growth.\n“Our focus is on improving counter share of VNB, not just volumes,” management said.\nProtection gaining ground within banca\nDespite overall softness, protection business within bancassurance is showing strong traction — particularly important given banks’ dominance in distribution.\nAt HDFC Life, protection growth in the banca channel exceeded 40 percent in Q3, though management cautioned that the impact is muted at the headline level due to lower ticket sizes versus savings products.\n“You need to sell about 2.5 protection policies to equal one savings policy in banca,” Padalkar said.\nICICI Prudential Life also reported strong protection momentum across channels, including ICICI Bank, while noting that ULIP sales remain sensitive to market conditions.\nHDFC Life expects Q4 to build on recent momentum, with growth supported by protection and steady savings demand. ICICI Prudential Life said it exited Q3 on a positive trajectory and expects momentum to continue, aided by diversified distribution and ongoing regulatory reforms.",

        "full_content": "Over the past decade, regulatory liberalisation, digital acceleration and heightened financial awareness have combined to contribute to the consistent growth visible in India’s insurance sector.\nInvestments have quadrupled, and total premium growth has gone up from Rs 7.6 lakh crore in FY20 to Rs 11.9 lakh crore in FY25, per the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India’s (IRDAI) annual reports. The IRDAI has played a central role in this expansion through a series of phased structural reforms.\nFoundational measures such as the introduction of the “use and file” product regime in 2016 accelerated product innovation. More recent reforms include simplified licensing and registration norms notified in 2024 that reduces prior-approval requirements and the 2025 liberalisation of FDI to 100 percent, have materially eased market entry, capital access and enhanced operational flexibility for insurers. These measures, reinforced by inclusion-led initiatives such as the Bima Trinity and a calibrated move towards International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)-aligned reporting through Ind AS 117 have helped safeguard policyholder interests.\nIn parallel, IRDAI has articulated its intent to move towards a principle based risk-sensitive solvency framework-signalling a shift in supervisory philosophy, even as formal implementation timelines are yet to be announced. Despite this progress, the sector’s overall penetration in India remains modest, contributing to 3.7 percent of the country’s GDP, compared with a global average of over 7.3 percent, per IRDAI.\nThe protection gap, particularly in health, life and catastrophic events, remains substantial. Rapid digitalisation and the government’s “Insurance for All by 2047” vision are setting the stage for a broader inclusion drive, yet several operational and policy bottlenecks constrain faster adoption.\nAsk #1: Composite insurance licensing framework\nExpediting IRDAI’s composite licensing regime, which allows for life, non-life and health segments under a unified license, is essential. It will help optimise resource utilisation, reduce Expenses of Management (EoM), allow cross-sell opportunities and better overall risk management. As India moves forward, the framework should be complemented by clear prudential safeguards, including fund segregation and calibrated capital adequacy norms. Per an article by Global Business Law Review, it draws on global precedents such as Singapore and the Philippines to prevent cross-subsidisation and strengthen solvency discipline.\nAsk #2: Rationalisation of GST and Tax Benefits\nSpecific measures include exempting or providing a zero-rate GST on insurance agent commissions and allowing a full Input Tax Credit (ITC) on distribution expenses. Additionally, introducing enhanced deductions for term and health insurance under Section 80D, or ideally a new section altogether for all insurance premium-related benefits across life, general, and other types, would be helpful.\nIt will lead to reduced operational costs, improved agent viability, potentially enhance coverage for policyholders and enhanced uptake of protection products.\nAsk #3: Risk-based capital framework\nIt is imperative to allow the capital requirement to be based on the company’s risk appetite. If a company wants to focus solely on micro-insurance and affordable products for rural and semiurban areas, it needs calibrated capital incentives and corporate rebates. India can mitigate emerging risks through talent development, InsurTech adoption and early-warning systems inspired by global models, such as the Philippines’ RBC 2 and South Africa’s risk-tiering, building a robust Risk-based Supervision (RBS) that ensures solvency and trust, key enablers of IRDAI’s “Insurance for All”2047 vision.\nIn addition to the expectations, here are a few policy recommendations for the upcoming Union Budget:\nRecommendation #1: Incentivise climate and parametric insurance\nEstablish a sovereign reinsurance backstop or co-funding guarantee for pilot schemes in climate-linked or parametric insurance, covering weather and disaster risks. This move may de-risk insurers entering new lines, reduce the fiscal burden on post-disaster relief and enhance resilience in the agricultural and coastal sectors.\nRecommendation #2: Lower entry barriers for new and niche insurers\nIntroduce a tiered capital requirement regime for micro and digital-only insurers and offer transitional capital subsidies to new entrants. This will increase competition, drive product innovation and provide targeted insurance solutions for rural and emerging risk categories.\nRecommendation #3: Promote data, tech and skill ecosystem development\nAllocate R&D incentives to insurers that adopt AI, IoT and alternative data for underwriting and fraud detection. Also, create a joint public–private Insurance Data Exchange Hub integrating IIB, Electronic Health Record (EHR) data and lifestyle datasets under a privacy-preserving architecture. Moreover, introduce scholarships and tax credits for core insurance ops, actuarial and analytics training programmes. These actions may strengthen the talent base, improve risk pricing, increase consumer trust and create a globally competitive InsurTech landscape.\nRecommendation #4: Health claims oversight and pricing transparency\nEmpower IRDAI to have an oversight on hospital pricing and integrate the National Health Claims Exchange (NHCX) with direct audit trails. Push the insurance companies and hospitals to do a faster settlement, introduce penalties if needed. Overall, continue the faster claims settlement drive and build trust and transparency in the system. This will certainly enhance policyholders experience and trust in the system. Also, it might lead to a reduction in medical inflation, sustainable health insurance premiums and greater transparency in the claim’s ecosystem.",

        "full_content": "India and the European Union signed an historic trade deal on January 27, an agreement that cements the partnership between two economic giants and reshapes the global trade order.\nThe landmark trade deal provides unprecedented market access for Indian companies, with 99 percent of Indian shipments receiving preferential entry into the EU and triggering a new era of industrial growth.\nThe preferential regime is likely provide a massive boost to India’s various labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, leathers, marine products and jewellery, with an estimated $75 billion worth of exports ready to be shipped.\nThe development also comes at a time when New Delhi is trying to conclude a deal with Washington and reduce 50 percent tariffs on its goods.\nTextile and clothing sector\nThe deal will see tariffs come down from 12 percent to 0 percent, providing a big win for exports. The sector, considered to be labour-intensive and driven by MSMEs, will receive a strong upside from the deal as zero import duty on goods will make Indian garments and textiles cheaper, leading to bigger buyer contracts and steadier factory utilisation.\nThe deal opens door for Indian companies to a $263.5 billion EU textile market, providing mega opportunities for growth as current exports stand at just $7.2 billion.\nThe major beneficiaries of the deal will be -- Tiruppur in Tamil Nadu, Ichalkaranji in Maharashtra, Surat in Gujarat, Ludhiana in Punjab, and Hyderabad - Warangal in Telangana. Easier access for textile hubs has the potential to turn into larger EU orders and more factory jobs across spinning, weaving, processing and stitching.\nLeather and Footwear\nThis sector will see its EU tariffs drop from 17 percent to 0 percent, providing a decisive competitiveness to Indian footwear and leather products in an industry where the margins are tight and seriously affect buying decisions.\nThe deal is likely to trigger new orders from the European market worth over $100 billion in both mass and mid-premium categories, fueling new job creation in the country’s organized segment.\nTop hubs set to benefit are -- Vellore–Ambur in Tamil Nadu and Kanpur and Agra in Uttar Pradesh. Improved competition due to the deal can lift exports across tanning, finishing, components and final footwear manufacturing.\nElectronics\nThe Union currently imposes up to 14 percent tariff on 99.6 percent of electronics exports from India. The import duty is set to be removed completely, becoming a major growth catalyst for India’s already galloping electronics industry.\nThe increased trade access can reinforce “build-in-India” supply chains, creating stronger linkages between large manufacturers and MSME suppliers, testing and repair services, tooling packaging and logistics.\nThe deal is likely to spur growth in electronics hubs of Pune in Maharashtra and Rajkot in Gujarat, alongside Noida in Uttar Pradesh, Hyderabad in Telangana, and Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, linking large manufacturers with MSME suppliers and downstream services.\nGems and Jewellery\nThe EU’s tariff rate on this structure stands at 4 percent as of today and it is set to drop to zero following the trade deal.\nZero-duty access sharpens the country’s competitiveness in design-led and precision jewellery exports, where turnaround time, craftsmanship and supply reliability are as critical as pricing. Reduced landed costs are expected to lift EU demand across both plain gold and studded segments, while fostering closer ties with European wholesalers and brands. Given the sector’s strong MSME and artisan base, the employment impact could be substantial, particularly across cutting, polishing, setting and finishing activities.\nThe most immediate benefits are likely to accrue to established export hubs in Mumbai, Surat and Jaipur, where mature ecosystems can scale quickly with improved price competitiveness and easier market access.\nChemicals\nThe Union’s tariff rate of 12.8 percent is set to become zero after the deal 97.5 percent of exports.\nThe tariff elimination supports one of India’s most export-ready manufacturing sectors and is expected to accelerate scale-up in both bulk and specialty chemicals. Major gains are anticipated in industrial clusters such as Bharuch–Vadodara in Gujarat and Maharashtra’s chemical belt, reinforcing downstream manufacturing and generating ancillary employment linked to these hubs.\nPharmaceuticals and medical devices\nPreferential access under the FTA strengthens India’s position in the EU’s large pharmaceutical market and improves competitiveness in medical devices, where cost and compliance play a decisive role. Export momentum is expected from clusters in Thane–Raigad in Maharashtra, Bengaluru–Tumakuru in Karnataka, Hyderabad in Telangana, and Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, supported by integrated networks of suppliers, packaging, testing and logistics providers.\nEngineering goods\nEngineering exports stand to gain from tariff relief and improved market access across a broad product basket, enabling multiple manufacturing regions to expand in parallel. Key beneficiaries include Pune in Maharashtra, Rajkot in Gujarat, Chennai–Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu, Bengaluru–Tumakuru in Karnataka, and Mandi Gobindgarh in Punjab, where MSME ancillaries are well placed to grow alongside larger exporters.\nAgriculture-linked exports and marine products\nThe agreement also bolsters farm and coastal incomes by widening access for agri and food exports. Assam tea from Dibrugarh–Jorhat and spices from Upper Assam are positioned for stronger demand, while pepper and cardamom from Idukki and Wayanad in Kerala could benefit from smoother EU entry. On the marine side, export growth is expected from Visakhapatnam and Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh, Veraval in Gujarat, Kochi and Alappuzha in Kerala, and Digha and Haldia in West Bengal, supporting employment across fisheries, processing and logistics.\nHandicrafts, furniture and sports goods\nImproved market access is particularly significant for artisan-led and MSME clusters that ship smaller consignments but generate high local employment. Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh and Jodhpur in Rajasthan are well placed to expand furniture and handicrafts exports, while bamboo-based furniture and crafts from Barpeta and Nalbari in Assam could find new EU opportunities. Sports goods exporters in Jalandhar in Punjab and Churu in Rajasthan are also likely to benefit as entry into the EU market becomes easier.",

        "full_content": "The India–European Union free trade agreement (FTA) will not only make it easier for premium and exotic cars to enter India at lower prices, but could also open the doors for Europe to import automobiles and automotive technologies developed in India, according to a senior Renault Group executive.\nSpeaking to Moneycontrol a day after the launch of the new-generation Duster mid-size sports utility vehicle (SUV), Fabrice Cambolive, Chief Growth Officer and CEO of the Renault brand at Renault Group, said the trade pact has the potential to reshape automotive flows between the two regions.\n“We have been talking about getting India and Europe closer, and now we are seeing a real move in this direction,” Cambolive said.\nHe emphasised that the agreement should work both ways. “It should be a bi-directional agreement, which means it is not just important to be able to import into India, but also that the level of competitiveness and the level of products we have in India could be interesting for Europe,” he added.\nRenault is in the middle of a renewed push in India, backed by fresh investments and a pipeline of new product launches. The strategy is aimed at ensuring that India, along with Brazil, contributes nearly half of Renault’s global growth in the coming years, even as the company stays away from the US and Chinese markets.\n“India is a strategic market for us. It is where we see growth. It is a market where we can play not just domestically but on exports as well,” Cambolive said.\nAs part of its product offensive, Renault will become the third automaker—after Maruti Suzuki and Toyota—to introduce hybrid technology in the highly competitive mid-size SUV segment. The hybrid Duster, combining a petrol engine with battery support, will rival models such as the Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara and Toyota Hyryder, and is expected to be launched around Diwali 2026.\nAddressing questions on Renault’s electric vehicle (EV) plans in India, Cambolive clarified that the company has not ruled out EVs, but is prioritising its approach. “We are not reluctant to go into EVs; it is just a question of priority. The EV mix is 4–5 percent presently in India. Our main objective was to come with very efficient engines in the remaining 95 percent of the market. We don’t exclude launching an EV in the coming years,” he said.\nDespite the broader growth in India’s passenger vehicle market—which expanded by around 6 percent between April and December—Renault’s volumes remained largely flat during the same period. The company sold 29,763 units in that timeframe, ranking ninth among India’s largest carmakers, according to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).\nThe new Duster range will be powered by a Turbo TCe 160 engine producing 163 PS of power and 280 Nm of torque, while the Turbo TCe 100 engine will cater to the more accessible segment. The hybrid variant will feature a 1.8-litre petrol engine paired with a 1.4 kWh battery, underscoring Renault’s focus on efficiency and market-relevant technologies as it bets big on India’s role in its global strategy.",

        "full_content": "Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are central to India’s growth story, contributing nearly 30% to GDP, around 35% of manufacturing output and over 45% of exports. MSMEs contribute nearly 62% to employment. Despite this economic significance, MSMEs continue to face structural constraints - particularly regulatory complexity, fragmented compliance requirements and constrained access to affordable growth capital. These challenges are now being further compounded by rising protectionism and fragmentation across global supply chains, constraining the sector’s ability to scale and compete.\nAs India approaches the Union Budget 2026, policy expectations have shifted beyond short-term relief towards addressing these systemic bottlenecks. The next phase of MSME reform must therefore focus on simplifying regulatory frameworks, easing capital constraints and recalibrating policy architecture from one centred on survival to one that actively enables scale and competitiveness.\nThe compliance paradox and need for rationalisation\nOver the past decade, India’s formalisation initiatives - spanning GST, digitised tax administration, and labour law consolidation - have undoubtedly strengthened transparency and expanded the tax base. Much of this compliance architecture, however, has evolved around the operational scale and systems of larger enterprises. Particularly, for micro and small units, the same frameworks translate into disproportionately high compliance costs and managerial intensity.\nWith limited financial and administrative capacity, regulatory compliances consume a significantly higher share of resources for smaller firms than for large corporations. This imbalance discourages formalisation and incentivises firms to remain below regulatory thresholds. Budget 2026 must therefore prioritise compliance rationalisation rather than incremental digitisation, with greater emphasis on proportionality and simplicity.\nTranslating simplification into liquidity\nFor MSMEs, regulatory complexities are not merely procedural challenges - it directly translates into working capital stress. Advance tax outflows, delayed refunds and procedural disputes immobilise scarce financial resources. Consequently, for compliance reforms, they must provide measurable liquidity relief.\nBuilding on this foundation, one immediate lever could be the implementation of quarterly GST return filing and tax payment as a default for MSMEs up to a higher turnover threshold, coupled with a lower interest rate. These would meaningfully ease cash-flow pressures.\nThis linkage between compliance design and liquidity is also particularly visible in the aftermath of recent GST rate rationalisation. While the revised slab structure lowered prices for consumers, many MSMEs now face an inverted duty structure, where inputs are taxed higher rate than finished products. This has increased refund dependency, leaving significant working capital stranded for extended periods. Thus, a time-bound, automated refund mechanism, along with selective rate corrections, would directly convert compliance simplification into usable liquidity. Extending refund eligibility to GST paid on capital goods (under the inverted duty structure) would further reduce the burden of working capital blockage for smaller units.\nBeyond domestic taxation, export facilitation schemes under the Foreign Trade Policy - such as Advance Authorisation and EPCG - are designed to conserve working capital by allowing duty-free imports of inputs and capital goods. In practice, however, stringent compliance conditions, manual processes and officer-driven closures often deter MSME participation. End-to-end digitisation and automatic licence closure upon fulfilment of export obligations would reduce discretion and allow MSMEs to access these schemes on a more equal footing with larger exporters.\nRegulatory certainty is equally critical. For MSMEs, uncertainty often imposes a higher cost than tax incidence itself. Aggressive audits and prolonged litigation lock up both capital and management bandwidth. Strengthening dispute resolution through time-bound conclusion and reduced pre-deposit requirements for MSMEs would materially support working capital requirements.\nCredit access, innovation and technology adoption\nEven with regulatory simplification, MSME scale will remain constrained without access to timely and affordable credit - particularly in a volatile global trade environment. Tariff actions and demand shocks have weakened cash flows, especially in export-linked segments. Accordingly, measures such as interest subvention, extension of NPA recognition norms and incremental credit lines under an ECLGS-type framework can help stabilise capital structure.\nCapital constraints also limit MSME investment in innovation and product development. For the sake of comparison, China’s “Little Giants” programme - under which niche, innovation-driven SMEs in strategic sectors are identified and supported - offers a relevant reference point. A calibrated approach in India, focused on selectively supporting high-potential MSMEs in technology-intensive areas such as robotics, drones, defence manufacturing and electronics, could strengthen innovation capacity through targeted funding and measured tax incentives.\nAt the same time, MSMEs continue to face challenges in adopting advanced technologies due to low capital intensity. While initiatives such as the RAMP programme mark progress, technology adoption remains uneven. Greater emphasis on targeted financing would help extend productivity gains across a wider segment of enterprises.\nTo conclude, India’s economic ambitions cannot be realised without MSMEs that are more productive and globally competitive. To support the MSMEs, over the past decade, the government has implemented a range of initiatives - from ZED certification, credit guarantee schemes, to RAMP. Budget 2026 presents a pivotal opportunity to build on this foundation - not by merely layering new schemes, but also by simplifying everyday regulatory interactions and enabling access to patient capital.\n(Rahul Khurana, Partner and Ashish Garg, Principal Associate at Economic Laws Practice.)\nThe above article does not constitute legal advice.

        "full_content": "Several payment platforms including CRED, RedGiraffe, PayZapp and NoBroker have resumed or continued to facilitate rent payments through credit cards after tweaking their processes to meet regulatory concerns, even as IPO-bound PhonePe has kept the service discontinued, people familiar with the matter told Moneycontrol.\nPhonePe had shut down rent payments last year after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) flagged concerns around misuse of credit cards for person-to-person transactions.\nIn its updated draft red herring prospectus (UDRHP), the Walmart-owned company disclosed that it suffered a revenue hit of around Rs 1,250 crore after exiting the rent payments business.\nMoneycontrol had earlier exclusively reported that PhonePe, Paytm and CRED had stopped rent payments on their platforms following regulatory scrutiny.\nRent payments make a comeback\nNow, some players have quietly restarted the service after back-channel discussions with the banking regulator, according to four different sources.\n“These companies brought the feature back after strengthening end-user and end-usage verification. This includes collecting PAN cards of both the payer and the payee, along with rent agreement documents,” one of the sources said.\nThe issue stems from the nature of credit cards, which are designed primarily for person-to-merchant transactions.\nCred, PhonePe and NoBroker did not respond to Moneycontrol's queries.\nWhat has changed now?\nFor rent payments to qualify, landlords effectively need to be treated as merchants, which brings them under stricter merchant KYC norms. The RBI was concerned that routine person-to-person transfers were being routed through credit cards by being presented as rent, creating regulatory and compliance risks.\nMost landlords are individuals, although those with current accounts are easier for payment platforms to onboard. At the same time, banks have grown wary of the segment because rent payments are typically high-value transactions.\nNearly 18 months ago, most banks removed rewards and cashbacks on rent payments as the cost of subsidising such transactions became unsustainable.\nDiscussions around rent payments also came up during the ongoing payment aggregator licensing process, according to industry executives.\nPayment firms argued that credit card payments to individuals are becoming more common as corporates increasingly work with freelancers, consultants, content creators and other independent professionals.\n“Stopping all payments to individuals through credit cards could disrupt a large and growing segment. With declarations, PAN-based monitoring and proper end-user verification, these transactions can still be tracked and scrutinised,” said a senior executive at a payments firm.\nPhonePe has chosen a different path.\nDespite rent payments being a meaningful revenue stream earlier, the company is prioritising regulatory certainty in a year when it is preparing for an IPO.\n“After what happened with Paytm, companies are far more conscious of regulatory costs. RBI has never explicitly said that rent payments through credit cards are fully permissible. It remains a grey area and is still under scrutiny,” said the CEO of a payment infrastructure firm that works closely with large banks.\nThe executive added that some credit card-issuing banks have independently stopped supporting rent payments, even without any formal directive from the RBI, signalling that discomfort around the segment persists despite the quiet comeback by some payment platforms.",

The next level should come by 2032… to reach 3nm chips manufacturing,” Vaishnaw said.\nHe added that the roadmap to reach 3nm and 2nm manufacturing would be a core pillar of Semicon 2.0, drawing lessons from how South Korea, Taiwan and Japan built their chip ecosystems.\nSpeaking at the event showcasing DLI 1.0 startups, Vaishnaw said the government’s original approach of providing EDA tools, IP access and multi-project wafer (MPW) support had been validated by the progress made so far.\n“So many of you (startups) have taped out and validated your products. Many of you have found markets,” he said.\nIndia has 24 startups under DLI and that the next phase aims to scale this to at least 50 fabless companies.\nUnder DLI 2.0, which will be rolled into Semicon 2.0, the government plans to concentrate support around six core chip categories: compute, RF, networking, power management, sensors and memory.\n“With these six, we can build any major system — whether it is defence, missiles, railways or automobiles,” Vaishnaw said.\nHe also indicated that tape-out facilities for mature nodes such as 180 nm would be anchored at SCL Mohali, while nodes down to 28 nm would be supported through the upcoming Tata fab in Dholera.\nThe minister said inputs from startups under DLI 1.0 would directly influence the design of the next scheme, including what should and should not be supported.\nAt the event, several founders flagged the need for stronger backing for analog and RF IP, preferential market access in strategic sectors, and help in bridging cost until volumes scale up.\nStartups at the event showcased chips already in tape-out or testing stages across AI, RF and broadband domains.\nTrivandrum-based Netra Semiconductor said its A2000 AI application processor taped out on TSMC’s 12 nm node in October and is now undergoing silicon testing, while its R1000 AI-MCU is expected to tape out next month.\nFermionix, an RF IC startup, highlighted demand from defence and satellite communications customers for its X-band radar chips and sought government support to expand into Ku- and Ka-band products.\nInCore Semiconductor, founded by the creators of IIT-Madras’ SHAKTI processor, reiterated its push for RISC-V solutions and preferential market access in critical sectors.\nVaishnaw also announced that the government will institute Deep Tech Awards in 2026 across sectors such as semiconductors, AI, space and biotech.\n“With Semicon 2.0, we will have a major part of the programme dedicated to reaching the 3nm and 2nm goal. By 2035, we should be among the top four semiconductor nations in the world,” he said.",

        "full_content": "As India enters a new fiscal year, markets are likely to reward a Budget that preserves macro stability while accelerating the next leg of private-capex and productivity-led growth. The policy challenge is to sustain high trend growth without re-opening the fiscal spigot, especially when global rates, geopolitics and supply chains remain uncertain. India’s recent fiscal strategy has been broadly credible: the Centre has reiterated a consolidation path, with the fiscal deficit targeted at 4.4 percent of GDP for FY26 and a stated intent to keep the glidepath intact.\n1) Fiscal prudence remains the market’s anchor\nBond markets care less about headline announcements and more about the durability of consolidation. The FY26 deficit target (4.4 percent) and the broader FRBM-aligned roadmap signal continued discipline, which should help contain term premia and crowd-in private credit over time. A prudence-first approach is also consistent with sustaining India’s capex push without destabilising debt dynamics, particularly as interest payments already form a meaningful share of expenditure.\n2) Manufacturing support is key\nIf India’s \"Viksit Bharat\" ambition is to be job-rich (not just GDP-rich), manufacturing has to do more heavy lifting. The PLI architecture has begun shifting the export mix toward higher value-added categories and enabling scale. Government-reported outcomes indicate ~₹1.61 lakh crore investment, ~₹14 lakh crore production/sales, exports exceeding ~₹5.31 lakh crore, and employment impact of over ~11.5 lakh (direct + indirect) under PLI implementation progress. A pro-manufacturing Budget should therefore prioritize logistics, industrial clusters, power reliability, and trade facilitation—so that incentives translate into globally competitive cost curves.\n3) India needs 'humongous' capital for 2047 — reviving FDI/FPI is essential\nA credible development aspiration requires an investment step-up. The World Bank estimates India would need to raise the investment rate from ~33.5% of GDP to ~40% by 2035, alongside reforms that deepen integration with global markets, to plausibly reach high-income status by 2047. In that context, policies that unequivocally improve the ease of FDI/FPI—stable rules, faster approvals, predictable taxation, and frictionless repatriation—become macro-critical. Recent data show gross FDI inflows of USD 81.04 bn in FY25 (+14% YoY), with manufacturing FDI also rising, underscoring the payoff from investor-friendly policy clarity. Every progressive country in the world wants to attract capital for growth, and we are competing within the same capital pool. Thus, our taxation policies and ease of access should not only be alike but also best in class. We need a much more practical approach, which our current Government is very capable of.\n4) Tax reforms: a strong start but the real prize is a wider base\nIndia’s tax capacity improves most sustainably when compliance rises, and the base broadens. GST is a good example, reflecting formalisation and better compliance. Continued rate rationalisation, fewer exemptions, and simpler dispute resolution can further reduce compliance costs—helping widen the base and focusing on reducing rates.\n5) Strategic divestments: unlock resources and improve price discovery\nWith India’s capex needs large and persistent, strategic divestments can be a non-distortionary way to raise resources while improving efficiency. Budget documents and commentary suggest the government continues to budget “miscellaneous capital receipts” (including disinvestment/asset monetisation) rather than setting a single headline disinvestment number—yet the market would welcome a clear, time-bound pipeline and execution cadence. A mission-mode approach—especially in assets where private management improves outcomes—can enhance valuation realisation and credibility simultaneously.\n6) 'Out-of-the-box' metric: target business growth, not only tax growth\nBudgets often set tax-revenue growth “asks” for the revenue department. A more growth-maximising framing would be to set measurable targets for industry expansion, formal employment creation, and investment growth—because a larger economic pie typically delivers stronger, more durable tax buoyancy. The sharp rise in GST collections over time already illustrates how formalisation and growth can lift revenues without excessive rate pressure.\n7) AI as the next UPI moment: indigenous LLMs and the compute stack\nAI is rapidly becoming “general-purpose infrastructure.” India has begun building the rails: the Cabinet-approved IndiaAI Mission (outlay ₹10,371.92 crore over five years) explicitly includes compute capacity (10,000+ GPUs via PPP), datasets, and the development of indigenous foundational/large multimodal models. Follow-through matters—especially investments across data centres, GPUs/accelerators, and hardware supply chains—so India can avoid strategic dependence while enabling domestic productivity gains across sectors.\nBottom line for markets\nA pro-business, pro-growth, pro-reform Budget—anchored in fiscal prudence, manufacturing scale, frictionless capital flows, continued tax-base widening, credible divestment execution, and mission-mode AI infrastructure—would likely be welcomed by both equities and bonds. Fiscal credibility lowers the cost of capital; reforms lift the return on capital. That combination is the most durable “market expectation” India can offer.",

        "full_content": "Dear Reader,\nBringing change in India’s power sector is not an easy task. States control electricity procurement and distribution. Profligate politicians weaken the electricity distribution systems by offering free power, delaying tariff hikes and new investments. Yet, despite constraints, the central government is managing to bring about a positive change in the Indian power sector.\nConsider the latest data: power distribution companies reported profits at the aggregate level for the first time in recent years. The aggregate technical & commercial (AT&C) losses, which indicate distribution and billing efficiency, dropped from 21.9 percent in FY21 to 15 percent in FY25. The overall power generation mix improved as well, as our Budget Snapshot explains.\nThe power sector achieved this progress amid a rise in electricity demand and with minimal load shedding. Power deficit was at near zero levels in FY25. The gap between the average cost of electricity supply and revenue realisation narrowed. Payments to electricity suppliers improved.\nTo bring about the positive change, the central government linked additional financial resources to states and electricity distribution companies to improvement in operating metrics and reforms. Some states grudgingly adopted them, but the results are visible.\nStill, more work needs to be done to strengthen India’s power sector.\nThe transmission and distribution losses are way above global averages. India has to bring them below 10 percent. A large number of electricity distribution companies continue to make losses on electricity supply. Poor distribution and financial practices are imposing undue financial burden on electricity distribution companies and consumers.\nAnother big challenge is power tariffs. Electricity tariffs in India are not uniformly charged and are not globally competitive. Industrial and commercial consumers often pay high tariffs. This hurts competitiveness of goods manufacturers.\nTo get around the problem of high tariffs and power supply challenges, industrial consumers are increasingly resorting to captive power plants and private power purchase agreements. Consequently, the share of the industrial sector in total power consumption has remained flat in recent years.\nAt the same time, electricity usage by households and domestic users is rising. While this increases the dependency of electricity distribution companies on households for their revenues, readers should note that domestic users also pay different and often high tariffs depending on their area of residence (gated communities, urban areas) and level of electricity usage.\nAs electricity usage by households continues to rise, these practises and variation in electricity tariffs will increasingly come under scrutiny. It is better if electricity distribution companies bring greater transparency to electricity tariffs soon.\nTo strengthen commercial viability of the electricity sector, the government is planning to implement new measures through the National Electricity Policy, 2026.\nImprovement in electricity sector's finances, encouragement for more competition in supply of electricity, strengthening of electricity grid and expansion in share of non-fossil fuel capacity in electricity generation are among the objectives targeted by the National Electricity Policy. Faster clearance for the new bill and speedy implementation will go a long way in strengthening India's power sector.\nInvesting insights from our research team\nAxis Bank Q3 FY26 – steady quarter, valuation a draw\nIndusInd Bank Q3 FY26: Turnaround strategy awaiting execution pick-up\nShriram Finance: Sustained performance will be key to future stock re-rating\nKotak Mahindra Bank Q3 FY26: steady show, a great long-term story\nUrban Company Q3: Strong growth, but profitability hinges on execution\nJSW Steel: Can deleveraging, expansion plans offset margin headwinds?\nTracker\nPro Economic Tracker | Auto sales, consumer sentiment show improvement\nWhat else are we reading?\nMoneycontrol Pro Market Outlook | All eyes on Union Budget and Fed as markets brace for volatility\nRBI’s state finance report flags a problem politicians don’t want to name\nBudget Snapshot: The steady improvement in India’s energy mix\nRBI doesn’t hold back on liquidity measures, but needs a fiscal hand too\nCan NEP 2026 add spark to power reforms?\nIs Trump going soft on China while targeting US allies?\nTrying to change our minds about gold (republished from the FT)\nThe Long Road to the EU–India FTA: What 22 years of negotiations reveal about India’s trade strategy\nBudget 2026: Turning India’s clean energy ambition into execution\nBudget 2026 will test India’s innovation push and its impact\nThe carbon price set by EU that India cannot pay\nBudget 2026 could redefine India’s trade, tax, and growth strategy\nUnion Budget 2026: Key tax issues shaping M&A activity\nAs another budget approaches, judicial finality on the Money Bill’s remit is pending\nBudget 2026 must focus on innovation and deep-tech to drive growth\nThe ₹500 Paradox: Pre-budget reflections on value in a shifting economy\nBudget 2026: Four things MSMEs need as they enter the next phase of growth\nIndia’s reform express: Stability, sovereignty and a growth story written in data\nMarkets want Budget clarity and growth continuity without compromising fiscal discipline Markets\nIndia is still a structural overweight: BlackRock’s Samara Cohen on markets, AI and investor participation\nTech and Startups\nPersistent Systems sets sights on Europe acquisitions in push towards $5 billion revenue by FY31\nTechnical Picks: BEL, JSWSTEEL, OIL, VEDL\nWe have a crack team of reporters writing on everything startups and tech.

The company is expanding its capacity in transformers and high-voltage switchgear, which will enable it to target broader market demand in both domestic and export markets. We expect its power transmission segment to continue to grow at a higher pace than the power generation segment. We believe that the recent uptrend in commodity prices can have a near- to medium-term impact on margins until it is passed through. In terms of easing curbs on Chinese players to bid for government contracts, our interactions with industry participants indicate that Chinese players may be required to set up capacities in India if these proposals are accepted. Moreover, it will take time to get approval and quality certifications; thus, this move may not impact the industry immediately. We cut our FY26/27/28 estimates by 4%/5%/5% to bake in the impact of high RM prices and competition by FY28. We maintain BUY with a revised TP of INR3,400, based on 55x Dec’27E EPS.\nOutlook\nAs per our discussion with various industry players, if implemented, it will take 2-3 years for the impact to be visible in the domestic market.

        "full_content": "India’s Budget for 2026–27 has to make an unambiguous policy choice given global growth uncertainty and private investment off the peak, with the state once again stepping forward as the principal growth catalyst. The strategy is not novel, as the government from time to time has pump-primed the economy towards its potential GDP to sustain economic momentum.\nScaling up public capital expenditure\nAt the heart of our proposal lies a substantial increase in government capital spending—about 2.6% of GDP 2024–25 (PE), or nearly ₹5 lakh crore over and above existing plans in the next five years—to target investment in productive assets, ranging from infrastructure and logistics to green energy, housing, manufacturing, digital systems, and human capital.\nFor the budget year 2026–27, an incremental capex of ₹2.98 lakh crore is proposed out of the estimated ₹5 lakh crore capex in the next five years. Empirical evidence shows capital expenditure multipliers peak in the first 2–3 years, especially when infrastructure gaps exist. The goal is to raise near-term demand while simultaneously expanding the economy’s productive capacity. Table 1 describes the allocation proposed by PHDCCI.\nGrowth multipliers and macroeconomic impact\nPublic investment has one of the highest fiscal multipliers in the Indian context. Construction activity, materials, transport, and services respond immediately, while better infrastructure lowers costs for businesses over time.\nThe macroeconomic logic is familiar. Public investment has one of the highest fiscal multipliers in the Indian context. Construction activity, materials, and transport services respond directly, and improved infrastructure will lower costs for businesses over time. According to our estimates, the incremental capital push could lift GDP by roughly 0.7–1.1 percentage points over the medium term, once lagged effects are accounted for through a decisive push.\nEmployment generation and private investment\nIncremental employment generation was central to our budget proposal for pushing government capex. At a time when job quality and participation remain major policy concerns, our proposal is economically significant. Infrastructure and housing remain among the most labour-intensive sectors, absorbing large numbers of low- and semi-skilled workers. Our estimates suggest job creation, both direct and indirect, ranging from around 0.9 million to nearly 2.7 million over the coming years as a result of incremental government capex.\nThough public investment is not a permanent substitute for private enterprise, improved logistics, reliable power, digital connectivity, and urban infrastructure reduce risk and enhance returns for businesses. The public capex push will untangle not only higher corporate investment but will also reinforce India’s attractiveness as an FDI destination and should not be viewed through the lens of displacing private spending.\nIntegrating growth with sustainability goals\nOne of the more distinct aspects of our 2026–27 proposal is its integration of growth policy with climate and sustainability objectives. Green, ESG, and Sustainable Development Bonds are positioned as financing instruments for renewable energy, green hydrogen, and energy transition projects aligned with India’s target of 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030. Programmes such as the National Green Hydrogen Mission and solar rooftop expansion underline an attempt to combine fiscal expansion with global long-term decarbonisation goals.\nThe effectiveness of the strategy will depend on timely project rollout and coordination with states. But there are risks. Global financial conditions and commodity price volatility could complicate outcomes.\nConclusion: Capital formation over populism\nIn essence, our Budget 2026–27 proposal reflects a practical assessment of India’s growth constraints and opportunities. By prioritising capital formation over populism, the proposal reinforces the case for public investment as the link between today’s ambiguities and tomorrow’s growth.\n(Dr Ranjeet Mehta, CEO & Secretary General, PHDCCI.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "IT firm DXC Technology is set to shift its Bengaluru campus from Electronics City to Prestige Lakeshore Drive in Bellandur on the Outer Ring Road (ORR) even as several companies have moved out of the area, sources told Moneycontrol.\nIt wasn’t clear why the company is moving to ORR when others are choosing to leave due to infrastructure problems. DXC Tech could be looking for cheaper options after it sold its Electronic City campus, sources said.\nPrestige Lakeshore Drive, located next to the Bellandur Lake, will house the new campus of the US-based firm, which employs over 20,000 people in Bengaluru. However, several employees have raised concerns over poor accessibility to the under-construction tech park, flagging commuting challenges.\nIt may be recalled that real estate developer Sattva Group acquired DXC Technology’s 20-acre Electronics City campus for around Rs 400 crore.\nSeparately, global investment firm Blackstone has leased approximately 4.5 lakh sq ft of premium office space at Prestige Lakeshore Drive.\nDXC Technology had not responded to Moneycontrol's queries at the time of publishing.\nORR shifts amid infra concerns\nThe move comes at a time when several companies along the traffic-clogged Central Silk Board-KR Pura stretch are reportedly exploring relocation options. Areas such as Whitefield, now connected by the Purple Line Metro and North Bengaluru near Kempegowda International Airport are emerging as preferred alternatives due to better connectivity.\nAlso read: Crumbling Outer Ring Road pushes more startups, firms towards North Bengaluru, Whitefield\nThe ORR Metro corridor, part of the Blue Line connecting Central Silk Board to KR Pura, is slated for completion by December 2026. However, given the city’s track record of infrastructure delays, industry watchers remain sceptical about the timeline.\nDespite being the nerve centre of Bengaluru’s technology sector, ORR continues to face persistent infrastructure challenges, including narrow and damaged roads, severe traffic congestion, water shortages, and flooding during monsoons. According to the Outer Ring Road Companies Association (ORRCA), IT firms along the ORR contribute nearly $22 billion, or about 32 percent of Bengaluru’s total IT revenue.\nAlso read: Bengaluru losing GCC edge to Hyderabad, tier 2 cities due to infra woes\nOther companies moving out\nBengaluru-based food delivery platform Swiggy has also moved its corporate headquarters from Embassy Tech Village in Bellandur on ORR to Sumadhura Capitol Towers in Whitefield.\nLogistics platform BlackBuck has also announced its exit from the ORR corridor, citing poor infrastructure.\nIn a social media post on September 16, chief executive Rajesh Yabaji said the company was relocating to improve employee commute, triggering widespread debate over Bengaluru’s infrastructure challenges and even drawing an invitation from Andhra Pradesh IT minister Nara Lokesh to shift operations to Visakhapatnam.\nYabaji later said BlackBuck would continue to operate from Bengaluru, with plans to split operations between Whitefield and Koramangala.\nAlso read: BlackBuck CEO’s post on Bengaluru’s crumbling Outer Ring Road jolts Karnataka into action\nPrestige’s pitch for Lakeshore Drive\nPrestige Group CEO and executive director (Office) Juggy Marwaha recently wrote on LinkedIn that Prestige Lakeshore Drive reflects the evolution of Bengaluru’s technology ecosystem.\nHe said the campus, developed on what was once challenging marshy land, has now emerged as a landmark workplace destination, backed by Prestige Group chairman Irfan Razack and global investment firm Blackstone.\n“Today, three global technology MNCs have validated that vision. They committed long before its potential was visible, and today they don’t merely occupy space here - they call it home,” Marwaha wrote.\nHe added that Prestige is developing seamless flyover access to the campus at its own cost and on its own land. Future plans include direct metro connectivity, e-bus integration, and a proposed Greater Bengaluru Authority-PPP project to transform Lakeshore Drive into a boulevard-style urban corridor.\nPrestige Lakeshore Drive\nOn the ground at Prestige Lakeshore Drive, the campus is still very much a work in progress.\nAs of last week, construction workers were engaged in basic infrastructure activity on the sixth floor, including drilling for electrical wiring, putty work, and moving ventilation equipment.\nWhile the building appears largely done, interior and services-related work remains pending.",

        "full_content": "The shares of automakers dropped in trade on January 27, after the India and European Union finalized their much-awaited free trade agreement (FTA). Analysts have commented on what lies ahead for the Indian automakers.\nIndia will gradually cut tariffs on cars from 110 percent to as low as 10 percent as part of its new FTA with EU, and fully abolish duties on car parts within five to ten years, the European Commission said in a statement.\nCurrently, the import duty levied by India on completely built-up (CBU) passenger vehicles is 110 percent for cars costing over $40,000, and 70 percent for cars costing up to $40,000.\nIndian automakers have long opposed such cuts, arguing that they would discourage investment in local production by making imported vehicles more competitive.\nShould you buy Indian auto stocks?\nThe India-EU FTA will provide EU carmakers greater access to Indian PV market, which is the third largest globally in terms of volume just behind US and China, PL Capital said. The domestic brokerage noted that luxury vehicles comprise approximately 1 percent of the Indian market, therefore the tariff reduction should not impact the mass market players like Maruti Suzuki and entry-to-mid-level vehicles from Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles (TMPV) and Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M).\nHowever, it added that the tariff reduction may impact premium plus cars from these players to a small extent. “Tariff reduction on BEVs from 100% is expected to be applicable after 5 years in a phased manner, giving the likes of TMPV and M&M some relief. This India-EU FTA, which has been under negotiation for long,” PL Capital said.\nThe immediate concern for equities is not the long-term competitiveness narrative, but near-term uncertainty around pricing, demand elasticity, and margin protection, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head, INVasset PMS. “Markets are reacting ahead of operational clarity, which explains the visible churn in auto counters despite the absence of any immediate earnings impact,” he said.\nFor investors, the analyst said that the key variables to track are premium-segment exposure, pricing discipline, localisation depth, and export optionality. “Companies with a strong SUV mix, diversified geographic revenues, and robust balance sheets are better positioned to absorb competitive pressure. In the near term, volatility in auto stocks reflects positioning and sentiment, not a structural reset of the industry’s earnings trajectory,” he added.\n\"There is a strong and positive signal of confidence in India’s long term growth story. India today is not just a large market, but a future ready economy backed by reforms and policies focused on building a globally competitive ecosystem. The India EU Free Trade Agreement would be a historic milestone benefiting both sides by expanding trade and enabling deeper exchange of technology and innovation,\" said Hardeep Singh Brar, President and CEO, BMW Group India.\nAuto stocks:\nThe Nifty Auto index was down more than 1.4 percent, as seen at 2.42 pm. M&M shares were the top loser on the index, falling more than 4.5 percent to trade at Rs 3,382.50 apiece. Maruti Suzuki and Tube Investments of India shares fell around 2 percent each.\nTata Motors Passenger Vehicles (TMPV), Ashok Leyland and Exide Industries shares were down over 1 percent each, while Hero MotoCorp shares were down nearly 1 percent.

The stock is currently 25 percent lower than its IPO price.\nUrban Company Q3 Results:\nUrban Company on January 23 reported a consolidated revenue from operations at Rs 382.68 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 33 percent YoY rise from Rs 287.92 crore in Q3 FY25.

This included a one-time impact of Rs 2.69 crore arising due to the implementation of new labour codes.\nAt a consolidated level, Urban Company reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of Rs 17 crore, driven by ongoing investments in InstaHelp, which scaled rapidly during the quarter but incurred an Adjusted EBITDA loss of RS 61 crore. Excluding InstaHelp, the company’s core business delivered an adjusted EBITDA profit of Rs 44 crore. “We expect consolidated Adjusted EBITDA losses to persist in the near term as investments in InstaHelp continue, while the core business remains profitable,” the company said.\n\"The consolidated business had achieved Adjusted EBITDA breakeven during FY25. With stepped up investments in building InstaHelp, we expect the consolidated business to remain loss making for the next few quarters. The InstaHelp opportunity is significant and immediate, and we are committed to maintaining clear market leadership,\" it added.\nHow have Urban Company shares performed since listing?\nUrban Company shares had made a bumper market debut on September 17, listing at a premium of over 57 percent over the IPO price at Rs 162.25 per share on the NSE.

It was at Rs 4,443.56 crore in the year-ago period.\nThe EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) was reported at 27.7 percent at Rs 721.3 crore in the quarter to December, while it was at Rs 564.7 crore in the year ago period. Margin was reported at 14.1 percent vs 12.7 percent YoY.\nThe company's salt business recorded 4th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, India Tea business continued to grow with margins back in the normative range as the benefit of lower input costs were passed on to consumers, while Tata Sampann accelerated its growth momentum and Ready-to-Drink (RTD) business delivered robust performance.\nFor the quarter, the International business revenue grew 11% in constant currency terms, led by strong coffee performance in the USA.\nSunil D’Souza, Managing Director & CEO of Tata Consumer Products said \"Q3FY26 marked another quarter of strong, broad-based performance for Tata Consumer Products, led by healthy volume-led growth and sustained momentum across our core as well as growth businesses.

        "full_content": "The shares of JSW Energy and Godrej Consumer Products dropped around 10 percent each on January 27 after their respective results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026 failed to meet analysts’ expectations.\nIndia Cements shares meanwhile jumped nearly 5 percent on Tuesday.\nJSW Energy Q3 Results:\nJSW Energy shares dropped to Rs 432.8 apiece, the lowest level seen by the stock since February 19 last year. This came after the company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 419.94 crore, marking a 150 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from Rs 167.83 crore net profit reported in the same quarter of the previous financial year.\nThe firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile grew more than 67 percent YoY to Rs 4,081 76 crore during the quarter under review.\nJM Financial said that the firm’s results marked an “all-round miss”, with debt and execution remaining the pain points. It noted that the company’s management expressed concerns about transmission connectivity beyond 2027, which is a potential risk for aggressive RE expansion. “The company also has 29.6GWh of locked-in energy storage capacity (26.4GWh pumped hydro, 3.2GWh BESS). We cut down our FY28 EBITDA (-17%) and PAT (-52%) estimates factoring moderation in new RE capacity additions and rising interest expenses,” it said.\nThe domestic brokerage however estimates gradual improvement in key performance parameters as JSW Energy progresses in its vision of 30 GW by 2030; Net Debt/EBITDA (6.2x in FY25 to 5.8x in FY30), Gross block/MW (INR 46.7mn/MW in FY25 to INR 69.3mn/MW in FY30) and RoE (6.0% in FY26E to 7.4% by FY30).\nJM Financial reduced its target price for the stock to Rs 614 apiece, implying an upside potential of 28.5 percent from the previous closing price, while maintaining its ‘Buy’ rating.\nMotilal Financial Services also noted that the firm’s Q3 revenue missed its estimates primarily due to weaker than expected generation at Ratnagiri, Barmer and KSK Mahanadi plants. It reiterated its ‘Buy’ view on the stock, with a target price of Rs 590 apiece, implying an upside potential of 24 percent.\nGodrej Consumer Products Q3 Results:\nGodrej Consumer Products shares dropped to Rs 1,117.10 apiece on Tuesday, the lowest level seen by the stock since early December last year. The company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 498 crore, marking a marginal decline from the same period last year. The firm's revenue from operations meanwhile rose 9% YoY to Rs 4,099.12 crore.\nJM Financial downgraded the stock to ‘Add’ from ‘Buy’, with a target price of Rs 1,355 apiece. This implies an upside potential of 9 percent over the stock’s previous closing price.\nThe domestic brokerage said that on the profitability front, gross margin may not materially change considering the shift in product mix, and improvement in EBITDA margin will be led by savings in media and other overheads. “Post the recent run-up (+12% in past 1 month) in stock price, NTM valuation of c.51x is closer to the long-term average and limits the upside,” it added.\n“In India, we see GCPL logging a high single-digit revenue growth, supported by new actions (favorable season for Household Insecticides likely to aid double-digit growth). We believe India OPM will see gradual expansion, to the higher-end of the normative margin band of 24-26% by FY28E, aiding high-teens EBITDA growth over FY26-28E. Indonesia is likely to be a drag – we see gradual recovery in performance. Africa cluster is likely to see sales growth momentum slowing to a high single-digit, while EBITDA growth is likely to log at a low double digit,” said Emkay Global.\nThe India Cements Q3 Results:\nThe India Cements shares rose to Rs 452.70 apiece, after seeing some decline during the previous session following the release of its Q3 results. The Chennai-headquartered cement maker posted a standalone net loss of Rs 5.72 crore in Q3 FY26, compared to a net loss of Rs 409.38 crore a year earlier.\nThe firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile gained around 23.5 percent YoY to Rs 1,114.13 crore.\nMotilal Oswal says India Cements is witnessing operational improvement under UltraTech's leadership with recovery in margins and steady improvement in capacity utilization. The brokerage expects the company’s revenue CAGR at 11 percent over FY25-28, led by a volume/realization CAGR of ~9%/2%.\nFollow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "Asia’s green finance ecosystem is accelerating, most notably in India—a nation driving the region’s climate investment boom while the United States, once the global anchor of sustainable finance, slows under Trump’s administration.\nWith the landscape of climate capital being redrawn, India has emerged as a pivotal force—leading innovation, mobilising investments, and setting standards that will shape green finance across Asia and beyond.\nSince the reelection of President Trump, the United States has pulled back from global climate finance efforts. Rollbacks of transition finance (which enables high emitting industries such as cement or steel to decarbonise) and frequent reversals of ESG mandates have left US green bond issuance nearly stagnant. While federal agencies scale back climate disclosure rules and influential states ban ESG considerations from pension funds, the US presence in global climate finance negotiations has waned. This retreat has left international capital markets wary and fragmented—spurring a search for new leadership.\nIndia’s Green Finance Transformation\nIndia, meanwhile, has seized this moment with a transformative surge in green finance. In 2024, India’s sustainable debt market crossed $ 55.9 billion, up nearly 186% since 2021. Green bond issuances have been rising, driven by a new climate finance taxonomy—a framework that defines which investments genuinely aid the environment, ensures credible climate financing, and sets strict standards to prevent false claims of sustainability, known as greenwashing. Domestic funding dominates, comprising about 83% of green finance flows, with the private sector contributing almost two-thirds of capital and the balance coming from central and state government budgets.\nBehind these numbers is a clear policy ambition: India aims for net zero by 2070, but this decade is about hitting bold intermediate targets. Recent years have seen the country’s green finance flows jump 20%, to US$ 50 billion (INR 3.7 trillion) annually, spanning everything from utility-scale solar and wind projects to urban electric mobility, industrial energy efficiency, and climate-smart agriculture. Major players such as Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA), National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) and large corporates are rapidly issuing ESG bonds, while cities like Delhi and Hyderabad are pushing municipal sustainability bonds.\nIndia’s rise isn’t just about national ambition. Its policy and market innovations have made it the linchpin of Asia’s collaborative green finance frameworks. The Green Finance Facility (IGFF), launched in partnership with the World Bank, ADB (Asian Development Bank), and the Green Climate Fund, channels billions into clean energy and climate-resilient infrastructure, focusing especially on supporting hard-to-abate sectors like cement, steel, and energy storage. India’s approach—blending international resources with domestic capital and local innovation—has become a template adopted by neighbouring Asian countries.\nIndia’s leadership in initiatives like the International Solar Alliance and its role as an accelerator for blended finance (using government capital, guarantees, and subsidies to mobilise large private investments in sectors that are critical for sustainable development but often considered high-risk or with long payback periods by purely commercial investors) and risk-sharing platforms  (that help in mitigating risks associated with large investment projects) further highlight its position as a builder of transnational green investment ecosystems. While countries such as Singapore, Japan, and Korea push their green finance agendas, India often serves as a partner or model for emerging Asian economies outside China.\nSectoral Transformation: Clean Energy to Climate Resilience\nIndia’s policies are translating finance into tangible climate solutions.  At the end of September 2025, the country’s installed renewable energy capacity hit 247.3 GW, comprising 50.1% of the total installed power generation capacity. This surpasses the COP26 goal to reach 50% non-fossil fuel-based capacity by 2030 ahead of the target. The new taxonomy (a classification system that defines and standardises what types of investments activities qualify climate-friendly) ensures finance flows into clean energy, urban mobility, building retrofits, and climate-resilient agriculture. Adaptation finance—covering disaster risk management, flood control, and resilient farming—has nearly tripled, largely supplied by domestic sources but boosted by multilateral institutional partnerships.\nKey Challenges and the Road Ahead\nIndia’s clean energy momentum does not mean the path is easy. Fragmented regulatory structures, patchy sectoral standards, and risks of greenwashing persist. Achieving the Paris climate targets will require an estimated $2.5 trillion by 2030. New Delhi must deepen transparency, standardise reporting, and push for interoperability of green finance frameworks—the ability of different taxonomies and reporting systems to work together seamlessly, enabling clear, consistent, and comparable climate finance data across markets. Continued reforms and capacity building—especially among local financial institutions and project developers—will be crucial for sustained global credibility.\nTo conclude, as the US turns inward and global climate finance risks fragmentation, India is forging an ambitious new green finance blueprint—backed by cross-sector innovation, policy reforms, and public-private collaboration. The locus of climate capital is shifting east, and India isn’t just participating—it is architecting the future of sustainable development in Asia.\nAs the region evolves, India’s combination of urgency, scale, and collaboration presents valuable lessons and opportunities for the wider world. In this era of climate capital, Asia’s future is increasingly shaped by developments in New Delhi and across India’s renewable energy landscape—reflecting a broadening participation in climate finance and governance globally.\n(Ritesh Kumar Singh is a business economist and CEO, Indonomics Consulting Private Limited.

        "full_content": "India’s regulators have taken strong steps to bring climate and sustainability into mainstream finance. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has mandated structured ESG reporting through the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) Core, backed by industry assurance standards. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has proposed climate-risk disclosures that would make banks quantify exposure to physical and transition risks.\nTogether, these frameworks mark a shift from voluntary sustainability gestures to mandatory financial oversight. Yet, as the rules multiply, their foundations remain shaky. Each regulator -- SEBI, RBI, the Finance Ministry, and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) -- is moving on separate silos, using overlapping indicators and inconsistent definitions. What is missing is a single rulebook, a uniform set of quantified definitions, thresholds and timelines that bind these efforts together.\nSEBI’s ESG-debt framework demands pre- and post-issuance verification, but “green” eligibility depends on what issuers claim, not on a national standard. RBI’s climate-risk template is supposed to measure exposure to high-emission sectors, but has no link to any taxonomy thresholds. MCA’s digital reporting formats under the Companies Act capture environmental data but use different indicators. The pieces don’t talk to each other.\nThe Finance Ministry’s Framework of India’s Climate Finance Taxonomy, released earlier this year, was intended to provide the unifying anchor. A properly crafted taxonomy is necessary because it would be the dictionary of sustainable finance, defining what counts as climate-aligned activity and what does not. Without it, climate disclosure regimes become disconnected reporting exercises.\nTaxonomy without teeth\nThe draft taxonomy, however, remains qualitative. It divides activities into “climate-supportive” and “transition-supportive” but provides no emission thresholds, timelines or exclusion rules. By not quantifying what constitutes green or transition activity, the draft leaves too much room for interpretation, and potential misuse. If implemented in its current form, the taxonomy could undermine the very disclosure reforms it was supposed to anchor.\nContrast this with the EU Taxonomy, which sets technical screening criteria for each sector, defining measurable performance thresholds such as grams of CO₂ per kilowatt-hour of electricity or per tonne of steel. The ASEAN framework, too, uses a traffic light system, distinguishing green, transition and excluded activities. These quantifications make climate finance investable.\nThis lack of coherence matters because climate finance depends on trust that disclosures are comparable, that green bonds are genuinely green, and that supervisory data mean the same thing across regulators. Without uniform definitions, India’s climate finance system risks losing credibility just as it begins to gain significant scale.\nThe flexibility argument\nDefenders of the current approach argue that India needs flexibility. The economy is still industrialising and coal-dependent, and banks must fund both renewables and efficient coal. Many sectors lack clear low-carbon alternatives, and MSMEs cannot bear complex reporting costs. Strict thresholds could choke investment in transition technologies. The taxonomy therefore leaves space for interpretation, calling itself a “living document.”\nThat argument has logic, but only up to a point. Flexibility is not the same as ambiguity. If each regulator interprets sustainability on its own terms, investors and supervisors will lose trust in the data, and the capital markets would treat ESG labels as unreliable. Transition finance is useful only if it is conditional, bound by measurable milestones and expiry timelines. Otherwise, it becomes a cover for inertia.\nUniform definitions are more than semantics. They decide how much capital moves and where. Without them, banks may underreport climate risk, companies may overstate green credentials, and public finance institutions may finance projects that conflict with national climate goals.\nThe counterview is that India should move gradually. It should define principles first, then add numbers. But that sequencing reverses the logic of finance. Markets demand clarity before they commit capital. A taxonomy without numbers or timelines is not a foundation but a placeholder. Investors already face disclosure overload. If the taxonomy stays qualitative, market indifference is a major risk.\nFixing the taxonomy\nThe remedy is fairly straightforward. The first step is to quantify. The taxonomy should specify measurable performance standards and sector-specific thresholds such as emissions per unit, minimum efficiency improvements and share of low-carbon input for key sectors such as power, steel, cement, and transport to start with, which will be based on domestic research and existing benchmarks. Projects could then be judged on hard numbers, not intentions. This would give both issuers and investors confidence that climate labels have substance.\nSecond, the taxonomy’s transition category must be tied to time-bound conditions and sunset clauses so that “transition” finance does not become permanent. The third step is to synchronise. The MCA should embed taxonomy alignment into company filings through digital XBRL tagging. SEBI and RBI should align their disclosure templates with the same definitions so that firms and lenders report consistently.\nFourth, verification must be credible. SEBI has already approved accredited ESG assurers and industry assurance protocols. The Finance Ministry and MCA should build on that by creating a common national registry of qualified verifiers, following international assurance standards such as ISAE 3000 or the PCAF methodology. A larger pool of certified assurers is critically needed.\nInstitutional mechanism\nFinally, India needs an institutional mechanism to hold this system together. A Climate Finance Coordination Board, chaired by the Department of Economic Affairs and including SEBI, RBI, MCA, and the Environment Ministry, could maintain uniform definitions, decide update cycles, issue interpretive notes, and resolve disagreements. The Network for Greening the Financial System offers a functional model of such coordination among central banks internationally.\nIf these fixes are made, the taxonomy could become the backbone of disclosure, not a soft overlay. RBI’s climate disclosure and SEBI’s BRSR might then work in synchrony, not in tension. Investors would know precisely what “taxonomy-aligned” means, reducing scope for greenwashing. Credit flows would have direction and capital would reach genuinely transition-ready firms, not those adept at labelling.\nIf India fails to sharpen the taxonomy quickly, we risk having mandates without meaning. The narrative would be lots of disclosures, lots of assurance, but little confidence in what lies behind the numbers. Markets would discount taxonomy-based claims, and capital might sidestep the system entirely. In effect, India would build an architecture of green finance, but without structural integrity.\nWhy coherence matters\nThe price of incoherence could be costly. India’s green bonds typically trade at smaller spreads than comparable global issues, partly because investors remain unsure of the underlying definitions. Meanwhile, ESG funds are under scrutiny for inconsistent screening standards. The credibility gap will widen if the taxonomy does not bring all the moving parts together.\nA unified taxonomy can strengthen India’s market credibility. Quantified thresholds give investors measurable comfort, consistent disclosure formats lower compliance friction, and time-bound transition criteria show that India’s policies are serious, not symbolic. This coherence would not only attract foreign capital but also help domestic institutions like banks, insurers and mutual funds integrate climate risk without duplicating effort.\nFixing the taxonomy will not solve everything, but it is the logical starting point. Numbers create trust, rules create consistency, and coordination creates scale. Once these are in place, the government can move to the next layer of integrating adaptation metrics, launching digital monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems, and building blended-finance facilities that draw private capital into harder sectors. But without common definitions, even the best-designed instruments will misfire.\nAlthough the window is closing, India can still build a credible, investable climate-finance regime that matches global standards while reflecting domestic realities. A single rulebook that is quantifiable, verifiable and time-bound is the only way to turn India’s climate-finance intent into lasting market confidence.",

        "full_content": "With less than a month to go for COP30 in Brazil, where countries are expected to submit their 2035 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) — their national climate action plans — India finds itself at an important inflection point. These near-term targets are the stepping stones for long-term decarbonisation and climate resilience. As India prepares to submit its next set of NDCs, the critical task is to chart credible pathways that balance economic growth, energy security, and decarbonisation.\nIndia’s net-zero targets by 2070 set a clear long-term direction, but the critical task now is to chart credible pathways that balance economic growth, energy security, and decarbonisation. For the long term, while the target is fixed, India could pursue multiple pathways to achieve it.\nIndia beats the deadline\nThis year, India also reached another milestone — half of its power generation capacity now comes from non-fossil sources, five years ahead of schedule. Recent projections by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) and the Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy (AEEE) model 18 scenarios for India’s future emission pathways to examine how different trajectories—shaped by macroeconomic trends, a manufacturing-led economy, progress in energy efficiency, availability of low-carbon technologies, and societal choices—could influence the country’s emissions.\nThe good news: across all 18 scenarios, India’s emission intensity continues to decline in the coming decades. Moreover, at a time when developed countries such as the US and European Union are backtracking on their climate promises, our analysis suggests that India is on track to exceed its NDCs target of reducing the emissions intensity of its GDP by 45 per cent by 2030. These reductions are largely attributable to continued deployment of renewable energy, rise of clean technologies, and improvements in energy efficiency.\nYet, absolute emissions will rise\nThe next question is how India can stay on course for the long haul. Will it rely on rapid structural reforms, a manufacturing boom, behavioural change, or breakthrough technologies, or a mix of them all, to reach net-zero emissions by 2070? This is the question we climate researchers ask ourselves constantly.\nHowever, absolute emissions are expected to rise over time, reflecting fast economic growth, rising incomes, and growing energy demand. India is expanding its manufacturing base for increased self-reliance, particularly in future-facing sectors such as semiconductors. So, aligning industrial policy with clean energy integration will be essential to ensure that growth remains compatible with long-term decarbonisation.\nWhere do we go from here?\nThe real test lies in sustaining momentum and making strategic choices that deliver long-term, equitable decarbonisation. Our scenario analysis highlights several priorities that can help shape India’s next phase of energy transition.\nFirst, the government’s push for rooftop solar through schemes such as the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana must remain a priority.\nRooftop solar not only expands clean energy access but also brings long-term benefits—reducing transmission and distribution losses, easing pressure on public investments, creating local jobs, and limiting land-use conflicts in a densely populated country. Further, our analysis shows that power pricing reforms—particularly the gradual removal of large electricity subsidies—make rooftop solar cost-competitive with grid electricity in the residential sector. But affordability for poorer households must not be compromised. A price-sensitive market like India’s requires continued support for vulnerable consumers.\nSecond, India must scale up clean technology deployment, but with careful attention to trade-offs. Support for small modular reactors, as introduced in the Union Budget 2025–26 could strengthen grid stability, a critical need as renewable penetration rises.\nBut nuclear power is not a silver bullet: in displacing coal, it could also crowd out solar and wind, just as the rapid expansion of solar undermined India’s wind sector a decade ago. Balancing these technology choices will be essential to ensure that India’s clean energy transition remains both ambitious and sustainable.\nThird, India must double down on clean mobility. Extending the PM e-Drive scheme is vital—not only to cut carbon emissions but also to tackle urban air pollution.\nYet, our scenario analysis shows that even with a stronger push for buses, private two- and four-wheelers will expand as incomes rise. Better bus services also trigger a rebound effect, as more people shift from walking and cycling to buses, raising overall mobility demand. These dynamics mean emissions do decline, but less sharply than expected. The solution lies in diversified investments for cleaner mobility—scaling public transport, ensuring EV adoption across segments, and building charging infrastructure.\nFourth, energy efficiency and behavioural change, inspired by Mission LiFE, are indispensable for India’s net-zero journey.\nConcrete evidence from the Bureau of Energy Efficiency shows that India saved ~200 MTOE of final energy, equivalent to around 1.29 GT of CO2eq, and close to Rs 760,000 Crores in savings from FY2017-18 to FY2022-23.\nInvisible thread that’s key to net zero goals\nEnergy efficiency is invisible by design – diffuse, distributed, and cumulative. Yet, without it, India will not be able to achieve its net zero goals. Similarly, lifestyle choices—such as setting higher air-conditioner temperatures, reducing travel through work-from-home options, and adopting recycling—can deliver emission reductions of up to 10 per cent by 2050 compared to business as usual. These shifts also ease pressure on land and natural resources. Government and citizens must reinforce one another in adopting sustainable consumption patterns, so that everyday choices add up to systemic impact. Our research shows that personal choices do matter and can reduce significant emissions.\nIndia’s progress so far shows that ambition and achievement can go hand in hand. As the country prepares for negotiations in COP30, the lesson is clear: We need to continue understanding trade-offs and shape development priorities that are not only low-carbon but also resilient and equitable.\n(Pallavi Das is a Programme Lead with the Council on Energy, Environment and Water - CEEW and Satish Kumar is the President and Executive Director of the Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy - AEEE.)\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "India has set itself the ambitious target of reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity by 2030. To put this in perspective, it is more than the total power generation capacity of Japan and Germany combined. This goal is more than just a number; it is a declaration of intent that places India at the forefront of the global clean energy movement. However, it will require more than just constructing wind farms and solar parks. The true test will be whether clean power can be efficiently and economically provided to the communities and businesses that require it. Open access is the mechanism that can make this possible, giving companies a straightforward way to purchase renewable energy directly and at scale. The 500 GW target can become attainable if India makes open access a key component of its energy strategy.\nWhy Open Access is Key to Meeting Demand\nThe case for open access is clear. Commercial and industrial consumers account for nearly half of India’s electricity demand and pay some of the highest tariffs because of cross-subsidy structures. These businesses are also under growing pressure to cut their carbon footprint, both to stay competitive globally and to meet their own net zero commitments. For them, renewable energy is not optional; it has become central to long-term planning. With open access, companies can source renewable power directly from developers instead of taking on the expense and effort of building plants themselves. Group captive models, where several businesses share investment in a project, make this pathway even easier to adopt and scale. Open access also offers flexibility in terms of sizing the project as per a company’s own power requirements. Another major advantage is that industries have clear visibility of the cost structure in open access, which gives them greater confidence in future delivery tariffs. In many ways, open access can be the demand-driven engine that complements utility-scale projects and accelerates private investment.\nProgress So Far and Emerging Momentum\nEncouragingly, there has already been real progress. The Green Energy Open Access Rules of 2022 lowered the threshold from 1 MW to 100 kW, giving smaller businesses a chance to participate. They also set clearer timelines for approvals and introduced a digital registry to improve transparency. The results have been visible. Open access capacity has climbed sharply, with some estimates suggesting it nearly doubled between 2023 and 2024. This demonstrates that momentum grows swiftly when policy intent is clear.\nThe challenge now is to carry this progress forward. Businesses need predictable and transparent charges so they can confidently enter long-term contracts. A more uniform approach across states would cut complexity and create a level playing field for companies operating nationwide. Stronger transmission and distribution networks, together with consistent rules for banking surplus renewable power, will give the system resilience and flexibility. These improvements will also reassure both consumers and investors, creating a cycle in which growing demand attracts more investment and accelerates the spread of renewable energy.\nOvercoming Challenges\nLooking ahead, three areas matter most:\n• Keep open access charges predictable so renewable energy continues to be the more affordable option.\n• Align rules and approval timelines across states, using digital platforms to make the process quicker and easier.\n• Strengthen grids and expand storage so clean power reaches consumers consistently and at scale.\nThese are not just technical adjustments. They are an opportunity to shape an energy system that supports businesses, gives distribution companies cleaner supply options, and inspires confidence among investors. With thoughtful tariff design and transitional support, DISCOMs too can benefit from the growth of open access, building stronger and more sustainable portfolios over the long term.\nAligning Policy with Purpose\nThe benefits of making open access a central priority are significant. As corporate demand for renewable energy rises, it will draw in more investment and push costs lower. Net zero goals will move from paper promises to practical action. Developers will see steadier pipelines of viable projects, and India’s standing as a clean energy leader will grow stronger. Above all, the 500 GW target will feel less like a distant ambition and more like a milestone that is firmly within reach.\nIndia’s energy transition is one of the most closely watched in the world. The country already has the scale, the ambition, and the momentum. What it needs now is sharper focus on the policies that bridge supply with demand. Open access is that bridge. Making it a policy priority will not just help India meet its targets but will also set a benchmark for how large economies can build a future powered by clean energy.\n(Sanjay Gupta is CEO, Apollo Green Energy Limited.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

Silver ETFs also mirrored the sharp surge in the precious metals.\nHindustan Zinc shares hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 733 apiece in the early trading hours of Tuesday. The Vedanta Group-company is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity.\nSilver prices soar to fresh lifetime highs:\nSilver futures on MCX with March expiry jumped more than 7 percent to hit a fresh lifetime high of Rs 3,59,800 per kilogram. The future contracts with May and July expiries also surged to new all-time highs of Rs 3,75,261 per kg and Rs 3,82,940 per kg, respectively.\nSpot silver surged 5.2 percent to $109.22 an ounce, after hitting a record high of $117.69 ​on Monday.

He added that silver is far more volatile than gold, and sharp rallies are often followed by equally sharp corrections once speculative interest cools.\n\"Entering at current highs could expose new investors to near-term drawdowns if prices consolidate or retrace sharply. A better approach for those who still want exposure is to use dollar cost averaging strategies, entering in small, staggered allocations that average out entry costs and reduce timing risk,\" he said.\nFor investors planning to exit their positions, Maxwell said that if silver was added as a tactical hedge or short-term trade, then this is a sensible area to book at least partial profits. \"Locking in gains and rebalancing back to target asset allocation helps protect against sudden reversals, which are common in precious metals,\" he said.\nHowever, investors with a longer-term view who believe in structural drivers like industrial demand and tight supply may choose to continue holding a core position, the expert added. \"This is not an ideal price for large fresh investments, and partial profit-taking for current holders is a rational risk-management move rather than a full exit,\" he explained.\nFollow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "As India approaches the Union Budget 2026, the clean energy transition stands at an inflection point. Budget 2025 laid important groundwork—doubling allocations for green hydrogen to ₹6,000 crores, launching the National Manufacturing Mission, and strengthening domestic supply chains. These measures have reinforced a powerful message: rapid decarbonisation can coexist with economic growth.\nThe results are visible. India’s non-fossil fuel capacity has crossed 260 GW, growing 22.6% year-on-year, with renewables now accounting for over 50% of the installed power mix. Yet, achieving 500 GW of renewable capacity by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2070 will require sustained and targeted fiscal support—especially for emerging segments where economics remain fragile.\nIn Budget 2026, three areas merit urgent attention.\nScaling-Up the Compressed Bio-Gas sector\nLaunched in 2018, the Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) initiative aimed to set up 5,000 compressed bio-gas (CBG) plants by 2023–24. While CBG blending obligations effective FY 2025–26 have revived momentum, progress remains uneven. Of over 1,100 registered plants, only about 160 are operational, and just 113 are currently selling gas.\nPolicy refinements—such as advance Central Financial Assistance (CFA), harmonisation under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, biomethane pipeline norms, and BIS methane purity standards—have improved the outlook. However, fiscal support has not kept pace with rising costs. Plant capex has increased from ₹4–5 crore per tonne per day (TPD) in 2021–22 to ₹6–7 crores per TPD today, yet CFA levels remain unchanged.\nCFA should be enhanced from ₹4 crores per 4.8 TPD to at least ₹6 crore per 4.8 TPD, without an upper cap.\nCurrent limits discourage larger projects, with plants above 12 TPD capped at ₹10 crore of support. A pro-rated CFA linked to actual capex—similar to the recent increase in viability gap funding for MSW-to-CBG plants—would encourage scale and attract long-term capital.\nEqually important is budgetary allocation. The initial ₹800 crore earmarked for Phase I (FY 2021–26) has been exhausted, and the additional ₹180 crore announced in September 2025 supports barely 10 plants. With over 1,000 plants expected to be commissioned by 2030, a cumulative allocation of around ₹10,000 crores is essential to unlock the sector’s potential.\nTo replicate ethanol’s success story, CBG economics must improve. While ethanol enjoys a premium of roughly 120% over fossil petrol, CBG trades at an 85% discount on an energy-equivalent basis. Supplementary revenues depend on market development assistance (MDA) for fermented organic manure and liquid fermented organic manure. Current allocations are inadequate to cover digestate processing costs.\nRevising MDA to ₹3–3.5 per kg for five years would stabilise unit economics during the scale-up phase.\nTaxation is another bottleneck. CBG plants face an inverted GST structure: output is taxed at 5%, while plant and machinery attract 12%, leading to blocked input tax credits and higher effective capex.\nAligning GST for CBG with wind and solar—where rates were rationalised to 5%—would significantly improve project viability.\nLeveraging carbon credit market\nFinally, carbon and renewable gas markets are approaching a turning point. The proposed Renewable Gas Certificate framework and forthcoming carbon credit trading system can provide additional revenue streams. Allowing CBG-linked certificates and carbon credits to be traded domestically and internationally under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement would further strengthen project economics, especially as global carbon prices remain well above India’s current proposed floor.\nGreen Hydrogen: Building homegrown capability\nThe National Green Hydrogen Mission has gained momentum, but achieving the target of 5 million tonnes of annual production by 2030 will hinge on domestic electrolyser manufacturing.\nTargeted customs duty exemptions for patented components and materials not yet manufactured in India can reduce capital costs and accelerate localisation—an approach already adopted for critical minerals and lithium-ion battery components. In parallel, incentives for integrated renewable-hydrogen projects can improve economics by reducing transmission losses and creating clustered industrial ecosystems around hydrogen hubs.\nBattery Storage: Strengthening the renewable grid\nAs solar and wind capacity expands, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) will be critical to manage intermittency and ensure grid stability. However, fragmented GST rates across BESS components inflate project costs. A uniform 5% GST—aligned with other renewable infrastructure—would accelerate deployment.\nIn addition, the viability gap funding introduced for 4 GWh of storage in Budget 2023 should be extended to larger capacities. Scaling storage is essential if India is to reliably integrate 500 GW of renewables into the grid.\nBudget 2026 is an opportunity to convert ambition into execution. By addressing these structural and fiscal gaps, India can strengthen its clean-energy value chains, crowd in private investment, and reinforce its position as a global leader in the energy transition.\n(Ashish Bhandari is MD & CEO, Thermax.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "The Union Budget 2025 continued India’s focus on the climate and sustainability agenda, with measures to advance clean-tech manufacturing, renewable energy adoption, sustainable agriculture and urban development, nuclear power development, and electric mobility, among many others. These steps were aligned with India’s 2070 Net-Zero commitment, supporting tangible progress reflected in rapidly growing renewable capacity, improving rooftop solar uptake, strengthening R&D for climate-focused technologies, and signalling the decarbonisation roadmap for hard-to-abate sectors. The Budget also made space for circular economy initiatives and dedicated support for MSMEs, reflecting an integrated approach to green growth. Building on this momentum, the forthcoming Budget 2026 is expected to deepen these priorities so that India can scale from intent to deliver across the next leg of its transition.\nRenewable Energy, Storage, and Grid Readiness\nEnergy transition remains central to India’s decarbonisation strategy. While renewable capacity additions have been encouraging, the next phase of India’s energy journey must address persistent challenges related to storage and transmission. Customs and tax support for battery manufacturing and the announcement of Viability Gap Funding have been positive, but Budget 2026 will need to deepen this support. Continued incentivisation for storage solutions and encouragement of scalability is a major area to watch. It remains to be seen which mechanisms will be used, given the aggressive pricing environment—whether through tax sops, inclusion under PLI schemes, mandated storage solutions, or financing support.\nAnother lever for strengthening energy security and sustainability has been the push for rooftop solar installations, which received an allocation of Rs 20,000 crore last year, up from Rs 13,500 crore. Ambitious targets and further allocations are expected to support the pace of adoption.\nBeyond core mitigation efforts, India’s environmental agenda requires robust, scalable technologies for air emissions, water efficiency, waste management, and industrial decarbonisation. Early-stage pilots in carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), green hydrogen, and alternative fuels underscore the potential of emerging technologies. However, their viability in the Indian context demands targeted investment, demonstration support, and accelerated commercialisation pathways. Technology and innovation will remain the backbone of India’s climate transition, and a continued push for R&D—particularly in energy-efficient and low-carbon industrial processes, as witnessed last year—is widely expected in the upcoming Budget.\nScaling Climate Technologies and Industrial Decarbonisation\nThe development of climate and sustainable finance, along with related market mechanisms, demands heightened attention. Deepening financial markets and encouraging attractive funding options are critical not only for meeting net-zero ambitions but also for improving efficiency across the system. The announcement and operationalisation of a Climate Finance Taxonomy would enable credible green finance and reduce greenwashing risks, which is crucial for investor and stakeholder confidence. Moreover, a fast-paced transition journey calls for financial incentives for green, social, and sustainable instruments for issuers and lenders.\nSuch mechanisms could be varied—preferential capital treatment, priority tagging and targets for lenders, concessional interest rates, lower processing fees, innovative and longer-tenor financing structures to support project viability, and rewards linked to credible ESG performance and ratings, to name a few. To improve access to green credit facilities and strengthen market discipline, introducing basic ESG disclosure norms for MSMEs and private players would be a positive step.\nMeasures to support a viable carbon market through a clear pricing architecture and robust monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) norms would offer confidence to all stakeholders—carbon credit buyers and sellers alike—and strengthen India’s Carbon Credit Trading Scheme. This would also help industries better prepare for decarbonisation targets and global stakeholder expectations.\nResource Security, Urban Resilience, and Inclusive Growth\nResource security through critical minerals and circular economy measures is another emerging strategic priority. The upcoming Budget is expected to accelerate the National Critical Mineral Mission, which saw a doubling of its allocation to Rs 3,500 crore last year. Given the importance of critical minerals and rare earth metals to manufacturing value chains, further announcements related to resource security are anticipated. Promotion of circular economy and waste-to-wealth initiatives through strong frameworks for inter-industry collaboration, support for related technology platforms, and expanded Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) initiatives would result in more productive and efficient value chains.\nAn update on the implementation and way forward for the Urban Challenge Fund of Rs 10,000 crore for the first year, out of a total planned allocation of Rs 1,00,000 crore, would also place climate adaptation in focus, alongside dispersed economic growth and water infrastructure development. Continued emphasis on irrigation and flood mitigation is anticipated, building on the existing Rs 95,000 crore allocation.\nSocial, Governance, and Sustainability for Inclusive Growth\nRecent labour reform announcements and expanded CSR requirements place greater responsibility on companies, while the Government’s parallel focus on skills development, women’s workforce participation, and social protection will help build a more capable and diverse talent base. On the governance front, initiatives to strengthen frameworks and oversight would be a positive step towards enhancing India Inc.’s long-term resilience and its ability to attract growth capital.\nBudget 2026 should deepen India’s climate and sustainability agenda by accelerating clean-tech manufacturing, renewables, storage, and scalable decarbonisation technologies. Strengthening the sustainable finance ecosystem through a Climate Finance Taxonomy and targeted incentives will be essential to unlocking capital for the transition. Progress on critical minerals and circular economy initiatives will be key enablers, alongside a continued focus on social and governance reforms that enhance India Inc.’s resilience and competitiveness.\n(Sheetal Sharad, Chief Ratings Officer, ICRA ESG.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "India has taken ambitious strides toward establishing a robust domestic carbon market through its Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), while simultaneously promoting a market-based environmental restoration through the Green Credit Programme (GCP). However, a critical oversight in these parallel initiatives threatens to undermine the integrity of both systems: the explicit permission for forestry projects to register under both schemes simultaneously.\nThis allowance, buried in the methodologies of both mechanisms, creates what carbon accounting experts call \"double-counting. When a single tree can generate both a Carbon Credit Certificate (CCC) for its carbon sequestration value and a Green Credit (GCs) for its physical existence, we're essentially allowing the same environmental benefit to be claimed twice. This isn't just an accounting quirk but it's a fundamental threat to India's climate credibility.\nTwo Credits, One Tree\nThe problem stems from the fact that these programmes measure environmental value differently. Under CCTS, forestry projects earn CCCs based on verified greenhouse gas removal, measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. A well-managed forest plantation might sequester 1,000 tonnes of CO₂ over its lifetime, generating 1,000 tradable carbon credits. Meanwhile, the same project earns Green Credits under GCP, one credit for each tree that survives beyond five years, provided the land parcel achieves a minimum canopy density of 40% over a 5-hectare area.\nOn paper, these seem complementary. In practice, they create perverse incentives. A corporate entity could use CCCs to claim carbon neutrality in its sustainability reporting while simultaneously using GCs from the same trees to fulfil compensatory afforestation obligations or Corporate Social Responsibility requirements. The same environmental action, i.e., planting and maintaining trees, gets counted multiple times across different compliance frameworks.\nThis matters because carbon markets only work when credits represent real, additional, and unique climate benefits. When Shell Oil claimed carbon neutrality partly through forest offsets that were also being counted by governments in their national climate pledges, the credibility of voluntary carbon markets took a severe hit. India risks repeating this mistake on its own soil.\nMethodological Confusion\nThe conflict deepens when examining how credits are calculated under each scheme. CCTS forestry methodologies adhere to conventional carbon accounting principles, including establishing baselines, proving additionality, and projecting sequestration over defined crediting periods. These can be either 10-year fixed terms or renewable 5-year cycles, with credits potentially issued based on projected carbon uptake.\nThe GCP takes an entirely different approach. It waits 5 years to verify tree survival and canopy density before issuing any credits. The focus is on ecological restoration outcomes, and only trees that survive the five-year threshold count toward credit generation. However, this methodology is heavily contested by ecologists.\nThese timing mismatches create obvious problems. A CCTS project might claim early-stage carbon sequestration credits while the same trees haven't yet qualified for GCs. Later, when those trees mature and canopy density increases, they also generate GCs. There's no mechanism to reconcile these different timelines or measurement approaches, leaving project developers to navigate conflicting standards without clear guidance.\nWhere Credits Flow\nUnderstanding where these credits ultimately end up makes the concern about double-counting even more pressing. CCCs serve as both compliance and offset instruments in India's carbon market, purchased by obligated entities that fail to meet their emission intensity targets. These credits trade on CERC-approved power exchanges and can be banked for future compliance years or sold to other obligated entities.\nGCs, though non-tradable and non-transferable, can be exchanged once for compensatory afforestation requirements, CSR obligations, or project compliance. While they can't be sold on exchanges like CCCs, they still represent valuable compliance currency for businesses that need to offset their environmental impacts, especially by virtually purchasing forest carbon sequestration.\nThe Indian Carbon Market operates as a closed domestic system, with no linkages to international carbon markets yet. This isolation, while protecting against external manipulation, also means there's no international oversight to catch double-counting problems. The burden falls entirely on domestic regulators to ensure integrity.\nBridging the Gap\nThe solution isn't to eliminate dual registration; the GCP and CCTS seemingly serve different policy objectives. However, the government must urgently address three critical gaps.\nFirst, establish explicit mechanisms to prevent double-counting. If a forestry project generates CCCs based on carbon sequestration, those trees' GCs should perhaps be discounted proportionally, or vice versa. Alternatively, clear guidelines should mandate separate accounting for claims made under each scheme, preventing companies from using both credits toward overlapping compliance obligations.\nSecond, harmonise methodologies where possible. While the programmes measure different things, their verification standards, baseline establishment procedures, and monitoring requirements should align to reduce developer confusion and improve transparency.\nThird, strengthen reporting requirements. Any entity claiming environmental benefits from projects registered under both schemes must disclose this dual registration and clearly delineate which benefits are attributed to which credits. This transparency enables stakeholders to evaluate whether environmental claims are legitimate or exaggerated.\nThe Credibility Cost\nIndia's climate ambitions are substantial, reaching net-zero emissions by 2070 requires mobilising massive private investment into carbon reduction and removal projects. Domestic carbon markets and green credit systems are essential tools for channelling that capital efficiently. But these markets only function if participants trust that credits represent genuine, non-duplicated environmental benefits.\nThe double-counting loophole, if left unaddressed, risks eroding this trust before India's carbon market even matures. International investors, corporate buyers, and civil society watchdogs are increasingly sophisticated in detecting carbon accounting irregularities. India cannot afford to have its domestic climate instruments dismissed as greenwashing vehicles.\n(Shashank Pandey is a lawyer.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stance of this publication.",

        "full_content": "The next phase of India’s climate story will be written not in carbon targets, but in resilient infrastructure and supply chains built to withstand extremes. Studies cited by the Reserve Bank of India estimate that rising heat stress and reduced labour productivity could shave off up to 4.5% of India’s GDP by 2030. Recent heatwaves and localised floods have already disrupted manufacturing clusters and strained urban systems, offering a preview of what lies ahead. Yet adaptation—strengthening systems to withstand these shocks—still receives only a fraction of global climate finance.\nEmission Cuts vs. Adaptation\nIndia today faces a stark paradox. While global negotiations remain focused on emission reductions, the country’s near-term growth already depends on how well it adapts to a hotter, more volatile climate. The UN Environment Programme’s latest Adaptation Gap Report places adaptation costs for developing countries at about US$215 billion per year this decade, rising to nearly US$387 billion annually when countries’ stated priorities are fully included. India’s own Initial Adaptation Communication to the UN climate convention estimates a cumulative adaptation finance requirement of approximately US$673 billion by 2030 to climate-proof agriculture, water systems, infrastructure, and urban development. Despite these needs, most finance continues to flow toward mitigation, leaving a widening gap between climate risks and investment.\nThe Adaptation Economy\nFor business, this imbalance is both a risk and an opportunity. The emerging “adaptation economy” spans infrastructure retrofits, climate-smart agriculture, water security, resilient supply chains, and new forms of climate-linked finance. As Asia becomes the epicentre of climate exposure, India is positioned to lead and capture a meaningful share of what could be a US$600 billion to US$1 trillion global market for climate-resilience solutions by 2030, according to emerging assessments of resilience technologies and services. The message is clear: adaptation is no longer peripheral to growth; it is central to maintaining economic momentum in a decade defined by climate disruption.\nInvesting in Resilience\nThis opportunity is hiding in plain sight. Global adaptation finance for developing countries falls short by an estimated US$200–400 billion annually. This mismatch between risk and investment is why adaptation has become a business issue, not merely a government concern. Large empirical studies by the World Resources Institute, examining hundreds of adaptation projects across countries, show average economic internal rates of return of nearly 27%, with every dollar invested generating more than ten dollars in benefits over a decade. Resilience, in other words, is an investment class waiting to be mainstreamed.\nTechnological Innovation and Financial Tools\nAdaptation is fundamentally the business of continuity. It keeps supply chains functional during extreme weather, allows cities and factories to operate despite floods and heatwaves, and protects workers and consumers in a hotter climate. In infrastructure, this means flood-resistant roads, heat-resilient buildings, and stormwater systems designed for new rainfall patterns. In agriculture, it includes drought-tolerant seeds, climate-indexed insurance, and digital advisory tools that help farmers and food companies manage volatility. In water management, it ranges from desalination and aquifer recharge to mangrove restoration and integrated river-basin planning.\nTechnology and finance are enabling a quiet shift in how resilience is built. Indian startups are developing AI-based early-warning systems, satellite-driven crop analytics, and IoT sensors that provide real-time climate data to insurers, utilities, logistics operators, and municipal planners. On the financial side, parametric insurance— which automatically triggers payouts when defined climate thresholds are breached—is gaining traction. Development institutions and governments are also experimenting with resilience bonds and blended-finance instruments to crowd in private capital for climate-proof infrastructure. The Reserve Bank of India’s increasing emphasis on climate-risk disclosure signals that resilience will soon influence lending decisions, asset valuations, and corporate creditworthiness.\nIndia’s Policy Evolution and Global Shifts\nAsia is warming at roughly twice the global average, according to the World Meteorological Organization, making it the world’s ground zero for climate risk. For India, the stakes are especially high. More than half the population remains dependent on climate-sensitive sectors, and even short periods of extreme heat or erratic rainfall can ripple across food prices, health systems, and industrial output. S&P Global estimates that nearly 60% of India’s listed companies face material physical climate risk by mid-century, underscoring how deeply adaptation will shape future competitiveness.\nIndia’s policy environment is evolving in response. Work is underway on the country’s first National Adaptation Plan, led by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The government has described the plan as a forthcoming national blueprint to embed climate resilience across agriculture, water, infrastructure, health, and coastal protection. This builds on existing pillars such as state climate action plans, heat-action planning, resilient infrastructure missions, and long-term low-emissions strategies that increasingly incorporate adaptation.\nThe outcomes of COP30 in Belém further reinforce this direction. The summit marked a decisive global shift toward adaptation, with countries agreeing to triple adaptation finance by 2035 and accelerate implementation under the Global Goal on Adaptation. These decisions reflect India’s long-standing emphasis on equitable, grant-based finance and recognition of the development needs of emerging economies. For Indian businesses, the signal is unmistakable: future climate finance flows, risk metrics, and investment frameworks will increasingly prioritise resilience and physical risk management. Companies that build early capabilities—whether by assessing asset-level climate risks, upgrading infrastructure, adopting new technologies, or partnering with governments—will be better positioned to attract capital and withstand volatility.\nConclusion: Adaptation as Strategic Necessity\nAdaptation may not command the glamour of net-zero targets, but it determines whether economies like India’s can sustain growth in a world defined by disruption. For corporates, this is no longer about altruism; it is a strategic necessity. Those that invest in resilient operations, products, and supply chains will be the ones to withstand future shocks and shape new market opportunities. The adaptation economy is no longer hidden; it is the foundation of future value creation. For India, leading on adaptation offers not just protection from climate risks, but the opportunity to innovate and build the solutions that a warming world urgently needs.\n(Suryaprabha Sadasivan, Senior Vice President, Chase Advisors.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stance of this publication.",

        "full_content": "As India continues its strategic courtship with several other like-minded developing countries for critical mineral partnership, the emerging architecture is becoming a defining pillar of its geopolitical and industrial strategy.\nIndia’s near-total import dependence on energy transition minerals casts a shadow on supply chain resilience when seen from the dovetailed lenses of geopolitics and its weaponsiation by some countries through export restrictions and more. The dominant policy conversations now revolve around diversification which has become both a mantra and a metric of energy security.\nFrequently, delegation-level talks especially between India and mineral rich regions like African and Latin American countries and India have been making news for acquisition of ores for digging. These are now widely interpreted as tangible evidence of India’s intent to strategically diversify its critical mineral supply base and reduce overdependence on single-source geographies like China for Graphite and Neodymium-Iron-Boron (NdFeB) magnets, both crucial ingredients for electric vehicles, wind turbines, etc., among others.\nBehind the Numbers: The rise of re-export hubs\nAn assessment of India’s critical minerals’ import data recently undertaken by the author shows a mirage-esque situation. The data showed that a portion of India’s so-called diversification is actually routed not through resource-owning states but through re-export hubs like Belgium and Hong Kong (HK) which process or merely redistribute minerals originating elsewhere. The result is a deceptive map of supply chains that projects resilience while masking the very dependencies India seeks to escape.\nBelgium is a striking example. India's trade statistics show growing cobalt imports from Brussels. Imports rose from ₹15.5 crore (~ USD 1.9 million) for ~85,400 kg in 2021 to a peak of ₹51.8 crore (~USD 6.2 million) in 2022 (172,000 kg), before tapering to ₹21.4 crore (~ USD 2.6 million) in 2024. It is important to note that Belgium has no domestic reserves whatsoever and it is the second largest refiner of cobalt in Europe.\nWhat India is importing, therefore, is not cobalt originating in Belgium, but Belgium itself sourcing directly from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) whose majority of mines are Chinese-owned and controlled. The DRC’s cobalt sector is well-documented for systemic governance risks, including labour exploitation, artisanal and informal mining dependency, opaque concessions, and severe environmental impacts.\nLayers of costs and risks\nThe premium prices India pays, often several times the raw-material cost, reflects midstream value capture abroad. This three-way relationship also exposes India to the shifting geopolitical calculus between DRC and Belgium, effectively placing its supply chain at the mercy of external political, regulatory, and industrial shifts beyond its control. In turn, it also adds another layer of vulnerability due to Europe’s tightening ESG norms.\nHong Kong is China’s workaround\nHong Kong is another illustration of a geo-economic buffer that China has adopted as a strategy and it presents as a diversification node for India. Cerium oxides are used in catalytic converters, fuel cells and hydrogen-related applications. China’s cerium exports to India dropped in 2023 (from ~110,000 kg in 2022 to ~178,000 kg in 2023) which reflects that they used HK as a re-shipment hub. Additionally, the dip in volume from China exactly mirrors the increase in Hong Kong imports for that time period.\nThe import value for HK is reported at nil despite huge shipments. This is because trade data only captures the port of export and not the payment partner, further corroborating the findings. There are other countries with a similar trajectory, however, deeper research is needed to ascertain the same.\nDiversification as strategy and illusion\nAcross these nodes, the pattern repeats: intermediary trading partners mask the true origin of minerals, and inflates India’s sense of security and supply chain resilience. Such practices create double dependency structures where India is indirectly tethered not only to China’s dominance but also to the political and trade dynamics of the intermediary state.\nIf geopolitical dynamics shift, for instance, if relations between DRC and Belgium sour, or if India’s own tensions with China deepen, the stability of these mineral flows could be jeopardised from multiple directions. In such a scenario, India’s access to cobalt and similar processed materials would face heightened risk.\nLayered onto this are growing trends of tariffs, sanctions, export controls, and resource nationalism, all of which are now commonplace in the global critical mineral theatre. Together, these forces create a complex web of exposure that weakens India’s bargaining position and limits its strategic flexibility. At the outset, this is not diversification, rather a trend of outsourcing vulnerability into a more complex, and therefore harder to detect form.\nJourney is equally important as the destination\nThis phenomenon is not a statistical quirk, it is a structural market behaviour shaped by logistics and strategic information asymmetries. For India, the implications are profound.\nFirst, policy suffers if diversification indices treat Belgium or Hong Kong as independent supply sources, then India’s import portfolio appears healthier than it truly is, obscuring the underlying problems. Second, these hubs distort pricing and bargaining power. This locks India into a passive buyer role while other nations build strategic reserves, invest in beneficiation, and shape global standards for traceability and sustainability.\nThe deeper threat is, then, normative: re-export hubs make India believe it has hedged against geopolitical risk when in reality it has only multiplied the number of actors who can constrain its access. In doing so, the risk is diluted, not reduced. And diluted risk in the critical minerals landscape behaves like invisible debt, it accumulates quietly until the moment of crisis.\nOrigin is the key\nWhat is required is a shift from import diversification to origin authentication. India must insist on end-to-end provenance through mechanisms such as Battery Aadhaar, bilateral customs-data exchange, and harmonised origin-reporting standards. Only then can policymakers distinguish genuine suppliers from intermediaries.\nIndia also needs to develop its own refining and midstream capacity through robust measures under National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM) and recover from recycling. Without domestic midstream infrastructure, India will always be vulnerable to the pricing power and strategic preferences of re-export hubs.\nThe clean-energy transition requires minerals, but minerals require governance, transparency, and strategic foresight. Unless India recognises the mirage of re-export diversification and confronts it head-on, the country risks building its energy future on unstable foundations. In the geopolitics of critical minerals, the map is never the territory. And unless India reads the map correctly, the path to energy security will remain more fragile than it appears.\n(Meheli Roy Choudhury is a Research Consultant at Chintan Research Foundation.)\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

According to the CPCB, several localities across the city continued to register \"severe\" air quality.\nBawana recorded the highest AQI of 497 at 7 am, placing it in the 'severe' category. Narela is recording an AQI of 492, and Okhla Phase 2 is recording an AQI of 474. In contrast, NSIT Dwarka recorded the lowest AQI of 411, according to the data by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).\nA layer of toxic smog lingers over Anand Vihar, with the Central Pollution Control Board reporting an air quality index of 491, classified as 'severe'.\nOther locations, such as Ashok Vihar (493), ITO (483), DTU (495), and Nehru Nagar (479), showed a severe decline in air quality, resulting in a 'severe' category.\nAccording to the CPCB, Najafgarh recorded an AQI of 408, while Shadipur registered 411, indicating slightly better air quality than other areas but still in the 'severe' category.\nMeanwhile, on Saturday, the Delhi Government's Directorate of Education directed all schools to conduct classes up to IX and XI in hybrid mode after the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) invoked Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) as the Air Quality Index (AQI) neared the 'severe' mark.\nAccording to CPCB, the AQI, which ranges from 0 to 500, is divided into six categories, each reflecting the level of pollution and associated health risks.\nAs per the AQI categorisation, readings between 0-50 are classified as 'good', 51-100 'satisfactory', 101-200 'moderate', 201-300 'poor', 301-400 'very poor', and 401-500 'severe'.\nAn AQI reading classified as \"Good\" indicates minimal or no health impact. With \"Satisfactory\" category, air quality remains acceptable, although sensitive groups such as children, the elderly, and individuals with respiratory conditions may experience slight discomfort.\nThe \"Moderate\" category, ranging from 101 to 200, indicates increasing pollution levels that may trigger respiratory difficulties among individuals with asthma, other lung conditions, or heart disease.\nProlonged exposure to \"Poor\" air can cause breathing discomfort to most people, not just those with pre-existing health issues.\nThis level has become increasingly common in several parts of the capital during winter.\nLevels between 301 and 400 are classified as \"Very Poor\" and pose a risk of respiratory illness, even among healthy individuals, when exposure persists for extended periods. The most hazardous category, \"Severe,\" includes AQI values from 401 to 500. At this stage, air quality becomes dangerous for everyone.",

        "full_content": "Despite clear evidence that plastic is clogging oceans and beaches and breaking down into microplastics that enter our bodies, humans are continuing to produce the material at accelerating rates.\nThe result: Global plastic pollution will hit 280 million metric tons per year by 2040, or a dump truck’s worth every second.\nThat is one of the alarming statistics from Breaking the Plastic Wave 2025, a report by the Pew Charitable Trusts with ICF International. It offers a comprehensive assessment of plastic pollution and its effect on human health and the environment.\nIn August, talks to forge an international treaty to rein in plastic pollution collapsed as countries that produce the majority of the material blocked proposals to limit the amount of new plastic created. Meanwhile, recycling rates have remained low.\nThe new report is a bit of a hybrid. It compiles data from recent research and then runs it through a model to predict outcomes under different policy scenarios. Winnie Lau, director of Pew’s Preventing Ocean Plastics project and one of the authors, said the team “wanted to pull it all together in one integrated analysis to look at impacts across the board.”\nPew published a similar report in 2020, but it limited the scope then to pollution from consumer-facing plastics like packaging that end up in solid waste systems. This report looks far beyond that to include “hidden” plastics, including those used in the construction, agriculture and transportation sectors.\nIf the world continues on the current trajectory, the outlook for 2040 is bleak, the report warns. Global production of new plastic is set to increase by 52%, twice as much as waste-management systems. Plastic-related greenhouse gas emissions are expected to surge by 58%, to 4.2 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year — enough that, if plastic production were a country, it would be the current third-largest emitter. At the root of the problem is the fact that plastics are mostly derived from fossil fuels.\nThere are some 16,000 different chemicals in plastics and scientists have identified more than one fourth of those as possibly harmful to human health. In the five years since the last Pew report, a wave of research has attempted to understand in particular how a class of chemicals known as endocrine disruptors, widely used in makeup and cookware, may affect digestive, reproductive and cognitive function.\nPew also modeled the global health impacts associated with the making and disposal of plastic (excluding microplastics) and related pollution. The authors estimate the world’s population will lose 5.6 million total years of healthy life in 2025 and 9.8 million years in 2040. Primary plastic production accounts for the majority of this via links to cancers and respiratory diseases.\nCountries and communities already have tools at their disposal to reduce the manufacture and use of plastics drastically. They could mandate better product and packaging design and invest in infrastructure to support reuse. (Think of how milkmen would once deliver bottles of milk while carting away the used ones for cleaning and refilling.)\nIn Pew’s ideal scenario, subsidies for plastic production would be eliminated and waste collection would be greatly expanded. If that happened, nearly 100% of consumer packaging could be collected and recycling rates could double, the authors write.\nBut even under perfect conditions, they concede, microplastics would be much harder to control. The main sources of microplastics are vehicle tire dust, paint and agriculture-related products — for example, fertilizer sold in plastic pods that dissolve into soil and plastic sheeting that is used for mulch. There are few straightforward substitutes for these materials.\nAmong Pew’s recommendations are decreasing overall plastic production, using safer chemicals and taking targeted actions to reduce the shedding of microplastics. One anti-plastics group welcomed the report. “We need laws that require fewer toxic chemicals in plastic and less plastic production, and we applaud Pew for prioritizing those measures,” said Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics and a former Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator.\nHowever, Enck said the authors were overly optimistic in projecting that plastic recycling would grow substantially with different policies in place.\n“There’s a good reason why the plastics recycling rate has never reached double digits,” she said. “It’s because its chemical and polymer complexity makes large-scale recycling technically and economically infeasible. We’re wasting valuable time by relying on a system that has not worked for decades.”",

        "full_content": "India’s data centre sector is poised for a massive expansion, driven by the country’s growing digital needs. However, as data centres consume vast amounts of energy—nearly half of which goes into cooling the servers—sustainability must be at the forefront of this growth. One promising solution is repurposing the waste heat generated by these facilities. By capturing, redirecting, and monetizing this heat, India can blend growth with sustainability.\nThe Data Centre Landscape in India\nData centres are large facilities that house servers and other computing equipment. These buildings contain racks of CPUs (Central Processing Units) and GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), the latter of which excel at the parallel processing needed for AI and scientific workloads. With India’s data traffic surging, the country now hosts roughly 276 operational data centres (private) and 41 government (4-Large and 37 small) data centres nationwide. Along with hardware, this expansion will require robust networking infrastructure and renewable energy sources to meet the growing demand, which is projected to rise by 40-45 TWh.\nIndia’s data centre hubs—Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai, Delhi-NCR, and Pune—have high energy demands. But India’s relatively low build cost ($7 per watt compared to $10 in the U.S.) makes it a hotspot for global data centre investment. The challenge, however, is ensuring that this expansion is sustainable by reducing emissions, using renewables, and utilizing waste heat.\nLeveraging Waste Heat for Industrial Use\nData centres can become multi-purpose assets, not only powering digital operations but also providing heat for industrial purposes. By embedding waste heat recovery systems, companies can repurpose the heat for uses like textile dyeing, cement drying, food processing, and greenhouse farming. This dual-use approach reduces energy costs and emissions while benefiting adjacent industries.\nIndustrial clusters and data centres can form a symbiotic relationship. By co-locating data centres near manufacturing hubs, companies can create efficient, sustainable, and resource-sharing ecosystems. This partnership can transform data centres from digital-only assets into multi-utility hubs, where waste heat supports both digital and industrial operations.\nFor example, excess heat from data centres could support logistics and supply chain operations by providing energy to nearby industrial facilities. By embedding waste heat recovery into every stage of data centre operations, India can lead the world in green data centres, turning an environmental challenge into an economic opportunity.\nGlobal Insights: Learning from Europe’s Success\nNorthern Europe, particularly the Nordic countries, is a global leader in data centre heat reuse. Countries like Sweden, Norway, and Denmark have integrated waste heat from data centres into their industrial and urban infrastructure. In Sweden, for example, a 1 MW data centre supplies heat to a greenhouse, significantly reducing operational costs. Similarly, in Norway, the heat from servers is used to warm water for lobster and trout farms, creating a circular system where excess heat cools the data centre and vice versa.\nIn the UK, a company uses server waste heat to warm swimming pools, while in Denmark, Copenhagen’s district heating system serves over 600,000 households, with data centres integrated into the grid. These examples show how data centres can be transformed from energy-intensive facilities into sustainable utilities for both industry and communities.\nFor India, these models offer valuable lessons. The country’s cold winters and industrial needs make it an ideal candidate for leveraging data centre waste heat for applications like textile processing, food production, greenhouse farming, and district heating. Co-location planning is key: a new data centre should ideally be located near industries that can utilize its waste heat, such as in regions with existing manufacturing clusters.\nTransforming Waste Heat into Cooling Energy\nIndia’s hot climate makes cooling the primary challenge for industries like cold storage, food supply chains, and pharmaceuticals. Data centres, however, generate large amounts of waste heat that can be transformed into cooling energy. Technologies like absorption chillers, adsorption systems, and trigeneration setups can convert this waste heat into chilled water or refrigeration, enabling data centres to support cold chain logistics, refrigerated warehouses, and other temperature-sensitive industries.\nBy embedding this waste heat into industrial clusters and smart cities, companies can create circular energy loops where digital intelligence drives both computation and cooling. This would reduce electricity demand for refrigeration, lower carbon footprints, and strengthen resilience in supply chains.\nApplications of Waste Heat\nAdditionally, waste heat from data centres can also be repurposed for: industrial pre-heating for textiles, dairy, and food processing; thermal desalination in coastal cities; greenhouses and polyhouses for year-round farming; aquaculture to maintain warm water for fisheries; seed drying and grain storage to reduce post-harvest losses and absorption chillers for cooling commercial complexes. These applications can turn heat into a valuable resource, improving sustainability and reducing energy waste.\nStrategic Planning and Policy Support\nFor India to tap into the potential of waste heat from data centres, a strategic planning approach is required. The first step is to map out industrial clusters and existing data centres across the country. Platforms like PM GatiShakti, the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), and the National Master Plan (NMP) provide geospatial data and infrastructure insights that can help identify optimal locations for new data centres. By aligning data centres with industrial hubs, renewable energy sources, and urban consumption centres, India can create cost-efficient, sustainable energy loops.\nConclusion\nIndia’s data centre boom need not be solely about expanding digital infrastructure. By capturing and repurposing waste heat, these centres can become dual-purpose assets that power both computation and industrial processes. This integration of waste heat into the industrial and urban landscape will foster efficiency, sustainability, and resilience across the economy. With the right planning and policy foresight, India can lead globally in green data centres, turning an environmental challenge into an economic opportunity.\n(Ateesh Kumar Singh, Joint Secretary at Ministry of MSME.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stance of this publication.",

        "full_content": "When the Amazon climate summit ended in Belém, delegates carried home ambiguity, something that could be seen as worse than outright failure. After two weeks of talks in the gateway city to the world’s largest rainforest, nearly 200 countries produced a Belém Political Package that looked substantive on paper, but was a collection of frameworks that postponed hard questions rather than answer them.\nHost Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva had set expectations high during the opening. “We are moving in the right direction but at the wrong speed,” he had said. By the time negotiators left town, they had demonstrated precisely how right he was.\nWhat the annual climate talks, also known as COP30, needed to deliver was clarity on three fronts -- how the world would finance the transition away from fossil fuels, whether wealthy nations would finally make good on adaptation promises, and how verification could work without becoming another burden on the poor. The summit produced pledges on all three, but it produced certainty on none.\nThat gap between promise and action was the real outcome of the UN climate summit. Markets needed certainty to allocate capital to mitigate or adapt to the climate crisis. However, COP30 left financial systems wondering where capital should go.\nUnanswered trillion dollar question\nThe roadmap to mobilize $1.3 trillion annually in climate finance by 2035 had been the summit’s centrepiece before negotiations began two week ago. The Baku-to-Belém Roadmap was supposed to reform multilateral development banks, reduce debt burdens on vulnerable countries, and channel private capital at scale. What COP30 delivered was that same roadmap with the most critical questions left exactly where they started.\nThis fundamental problem sits at the core of climate finance design. Private investors chase returns. They pour capital into renewable energy and carbon trading because those activities generate profits. The most urgent climate needs in developing nations generate no profits. Adaptation work, or building flood defences, creating drought-resistant crops, establishing early-warning systems, produces no financial returns. Yet these are precisely where poor countries need resources the most.\nAccording to the World Resources Institute, which called the roadmap “one of the most comprehensive attempts yet” to align global financial architecture with climate needs, private investors would shy away from adaptation work. No agreement emerged during COP30 on how to bridge that gap or on how much public money wealthy nations would commit.\nDeveloped nations argued that all countries with capacity should contribute. Developing nations countered that rich countries bore historical responsibility and must lead. Neither side moved. Instead, negotiators moved finance discussions into “presidency consultations,” which is diplomatic language for postponement.\nFor corporations planning billion-dollar investments in adaptation infrastructure or green technology, this creates a problem. Climate finance remains speculative rather than investment-grade. Companies cannot reliably forecast capital flows to emerging markets or predict interest rates. They cannot determine which countries will have resources to absorb climate shocks without disrupting supply chains. Corporate capital will stay cautious after the Brazil summit.\nFossil fuel standoff\nThe summit’s most visible failure concerned fossil fuels. More than 80 countries had pushed for a detailed global roadmap on how quickly the world would abandon oil, gas and coal. Brazil supported the idea and secured widespread backing. Yet even that modest goal proved too contentious.\nResistance from major fossil fuel producers pared back this ambition considerably. What remained was only general language urging transition in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement, with no timeline, pace specification, or enforcement mechanisms.\nMary Robinson, former President of Ireland and a climate advocate, captured the disappointment. “While very disappointingly countries failed to agree on a collective roadmap to phase out fossil fuels or end deforestation, the global direction of travel is clear,” she said. “This deal isn't perfect and is far from what science requires.”\nFor energy strategists at multinationals, this represented the summit’s core weakness. Companies needed coordinated signals from governments. They needed to know whether their strategies would align with the global trajectory or whether each economy would be writing its own energy policy. COP30 left that unresolved.\nWhat emerged instead was commitment to develop a just transition mechanism, a platform for sharing knowledge about shifting away from fossil fuels. But the mechanism produces no capital. “We celebrate the decision to develop the just transition mechanism. We leave Belém with a historic victory for people power, but a devastating failure of political will from the Global North to deliver climate ambition and finance,” said Harjeet Singh, Founding Director of the Satat Sampada Climate Foundation. “Without strong public funding, the transition to a greener future remains a mirage.\"\nTrade tensions surrounding fossil fuels also remained unresolved. The European Union has implemented carbon border adjustment mechanisms. The United States is moving toward similar measures. Developing nations view tariffs as protectionism wearing a climate mask. No framework was worked out to manage the intersection of climate policy and trade rules. For supply chain strategists, this means assuming trade fragmentation rather than harmonization.\nAdaptation promises without timelines\nThe summit promised to triple adaptation finance to roughly $120 billion annually by 2035 and formalised within the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance. The pledge looked substantial until examined. First, the timeline is distant. Countries facing escalating heatwaves, floods and droughts need resources now, not a decade away.\n“Wealthy nations continue to dodge responsibility, pushing loans over grants and refusing clear commitments for a fossil fuel phase-out, deepening the trust deficit,” said Shailendra Yashwant, Senior Advisor at Climate Action Network South Asia. “What South Asia and other regions require is urgent, grant-based, accessible finance that reaches communities now.”\nSecond, accountability remains absent. “The goal of tripling adaptation finance remains vague with no specific accountability of contributors,” said Avantika Goswami, Programme Manager of Climate Change at the Centre for Science and Environment. The 2009 promise of $100 billion in annual climate finance did never fully met on schedule. New promises rest on a track record of broken commitments.\nThird, the funding gap is enormous. The summit announced $135 million for the adaptation fund and $300 million for Brazil's health action plan to protect clinics from climate risks. These sums are small against actual adaptation needs. For companies with supply chains in agricultural regions, healthcare systems or water-stressed areas, this underinvestment means operational risk persists. Farmers without drought-resistant seeds will lose harvests, hospitals without climate-resilient infrastructure will collapse during heatwaves.\nLoss and damage trap\nThe summit did take some incremental steps for the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage, which has been designed to help countries recover from climate disasters. Structurally, this represented progress. But access remained limited. Vulnerable nations wanted the fund to work quickly with guaranteed contributions. Donor countries wanted to move cautiously and assess applications case by case. COP30 produced no mechanism bridging these positions.\nAvinash Persaud, senior advisor to the Inter-American Development Bank, identified the core problem. “The world fell short on more rapid release grants for developing countries responding to loss and damage,” he said. “That goal is as urgent as it is hard.”\nWhen disaster strikes, governments need cash within weeks. The current system operates on timescales measured in months or years. This gap creates economic uncertainty. For multinational corporations, if disaster funds arrive late, local suppliers would lack working capital, which could lead to stopped production, faltering delivery falters and rising costs.\nNo consensus emerged during COP30 on how countries should strengthen national climate plans before submitting new versions in 2025. The World Resources Institute had released sobering research in its State of Climate Action 2025 report. No major economic sector is moving fast enough to limit warming to safer levels, it had said. Research from the Climate Action Tracker had showed that current national plans would still lead to dangerous warming even if every country kept every promise.\nCOP30 left these questions unresolved. Some nations wanted binding commitments and strict review standards. Others wanted flexibility. The underlying tension persisted at the end of the summit. This means 2025 national plans will likely repeat patterns of recent decades, which could translate into ambitious language with inadequate commitments and persistent gaps between what science requires and what policy delivers.\nWhat businesses must understand\nCOP30 edged the world forward, but not decisively. For corporate leaders, the message was unambiguous. They cannot assume policy certainty exists where it does not. They will be compelled to build scenario planning into climate commitments and assume policy fragmentation rather than harmonization.\nThree critical gaps remained unresolved. First, finance clarity never materialized. No one knows how much money will actually flow and when. The roadmap to $1.3 trillion exists as aspiration, not specification. Second, trade frameworks remained absent. No governance mechanism exists for managing carbon tariffs and climate-related trade measures. Third, verification with accountability never emerged. Transparency demands multiplied, while funding commitments stalled.\nThe real test would arrive in 2025, when countries submit new national climate plans. If those plans break the pattern of disappointing ambition, climate action may find momentum. If they repeat history, corporate climate strategies should assume policy fragmentation will persist.\nSupply chain resilience requires local adaptation, not global coordination. ESG investors face continued alignment challenges between corporate targets and government reality. Capital allocation to climate action remains speculative until delivery mechanisms prove real rather than rhetorical.\nCOP30 was supposed to be the summit where the UN process shifted from intentions to implementation. Instead, it demonstrated once more that climate summits only postpone hard decisions. The next year will determine whether Belém was genuinely a turning point, or simply another missed moment. For now, the world remains suspended between hope and hesitation, and businesses must plan accordingly.",

        "full_content": "India has dropped to 23rd place in the Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI), slipping into the report’s “medium” category and losing ground after several years near the top. In the preceding report, India was ranked 10th and placed in the “high” category for overall performance.\nThe new ranking shows rising emissions and slow growth in renewable energy holding the country back.\nThe index, released on 18 November by Germanwatch, NewClimate Institute and Climate Action Network International, rated countries on greenhouse-gas trends, renewable energy, energy use and climate policy. India scored well on energy use per person and on some long-term emissions indicators, but earned a low rating for the share of renewables in its total energy supply and only a medium rating for climate policy. Those factors explain most of the fall, the report said.\nIndia’s slide reflects “steady emissions growth and the lack of a clear plan to end new coal projects,” said Jan Burck of Germanwatch, co-author of the report. India could climb back up the rankings if it slows bringing in new coal to generate electricity and keeps expanding clean energy.\nThe report arrived as negotiators at the UN climate summit (COP30) in Belém in Brazil were close to the finish line. India has made progress in installing solar parks and improving energy efficiency, the CCPI said. But it stressed that the country’s overall energy system is still dominated by coal, and that no national deadline exists to reduce or eventually stop building coal power plants. The authors called for clear timelines and stronger policy signals across sectors.\nIndia’s climate vulnerability\nIndia’s vulnerability to the climate crisis adds pressure to improve its performance. The Climate Risk Index, also published by Germanwatch, listed India among the countries most affected by extreme weather over the past three decades. Floods, heatwaves, cyclones and landslides have caused deaths and billions of dollars in economic losses. The new CCPI said this risk should be central to India’s climate planning.\nScientific evidence has reinforced the concern. A recent study warned that oppressive heatwaves, or periods when heat and humidity together become dangerous, could increase sharply in India as the planet warms. Another study showed residential cooling demand is rising fast in India, and is likely to grow even more unless buildings become more efficient and electricity becomes cleaner.\nThe UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2025 warned that even if all countries meet their current promises, the world is still heading for around 2.3 to 2.5 degrees Celsius of warming this century. The CCPI report said no country was on track for the 1.5-degree goal, and once again left the top three spots on the table empty.\nThe world is at a “turning point,” said Niklas Höhne of the NewClimate Institute, another CCPI author. Global emissions must start dropping quickly to avoid severe impacts, Höhne said. His warning underscored the limits of India’s current pace.\nIndian climate activists were varied in their reactions to the new ranking. “India has a good chance to improve this ranking by preparing a clear-cut coal phase-out plan and facilitating a people-centric just transition plan that not only reduces emissions, but also takes care of inclusive approaches to ecological restoration and economic revival,” said Ranjan Panda, Convenor, Combat Climate Change Network.\nA coal phase-out plan refers to a step-by-step schedule to reduce and eventually end coal use. A just transition means supporting workers and communities during the shift to clean energy.\nNarrow lens of coal usage\n“It is hypocritical to judge India through a narrow lens of coal usage without acknowledging that we are supporting 1.5 billion lives on a fraction of the energy consumed by the West,” said Harjeet Singh, Founding Director, Satat Sampada Climate Foundation. “The world needs a faster phase-out of fossil fuels, but it must be led and funded by wealthy nations, not forced.”\nPublic funding remains critical, according to Janet Milongo of Climate Action Network International. “Energy inequity continues to be a reality for many people in the world,” she said, arguing that more grant-based finance was needed to help countries shift to renewable energy.\nFor India, the latest CCPI results carry both risks and opportunities. They show that the country has strengths, especially in emissions per person and energy use. But they also show that India’s clean-energy share is not rising fast enough to keep pace with growing demand.\nAs COP30 negotiators in Brazil push toward an action outcome before the scheduled end of the summit on 21 November, India has called for more climate finance, more access to clean-energy technology and stronger support for adaptation, or adjusting to the effect of climate change to minimize harm. At the same time, the report signalled that India will face growing pressure to outline a clear path away from coal and toward faster renewable-energy growth.\nThe CCPI is not an indicator of future progress, only of present momentum. But its message for India is direct. The country has the capacity to improve, and the consequences of slow action are already visible on the ground. The decisions taken in the next few years, and in the final hours at Belém, will shape whether India can climb back into the top tier of climate performers.",

        "full_content": "A report released earlier this week showed developing countries, excluding China, need $2.4 trillion annually by 2030, climbing to about $3.2 trillion by 2035. The fourth assessment from the Independent High-Level Expert Group on Climate Finance (IHLEG) at the London School of Economics arrived soon after soon after negotiators gathered in Belém for the annual UN climate summit (COP30).\nIt confirmed what many had suspected. The targets agreed last year fall far short of actual requirements. Last year’s climate meet set an aspirational goal of $1.3 trillion each year by 2035. Wealthy nations committed to provide $300 billion to developing countries, with the remainder expected from emerging economies and private investors. It is clear that the gap between aspiration and documented need is substantial.\nArunabha Ghosh, chief executive of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), argued the framing itself is flawed. Climate finance represents economic necessity, not charity, he said. Without rethinking how markets and governments approach this, climate action will likely stall. The central problem is capital allocation. Money exists in global markets. It simply refuses to flow where most needed.\nNicholas Stern of the London School of Economics, who co-authored the assessment, addressed this directly. “Private finance will not flow at scale without public risk-sharing,” he said. Public money must move first, building confidence to unlock trillions parked in capital markets.\nThe barriers are well documented. Projects in emerging markets carry risk perceptions that often exceed reality. International finance retains systematic biases against developing economies. Countries requiring the largest investments face the highest capital costs, creating a self-reinforcing constraint.\nIndian illustration\nIndia illustrates how this operates in practice. Research from the Centre for Social and Economic Progress estimates that India needs roughly $467 billion by 2030, concentrated in the steel, cement, power and transport sectors. Each presents distinct challenges.\nIndia has amply demonstrated that capital moves when the conditions are right. Renewable energy, for instance, has attracted foreign investment successfully. Inflows have tripled over the past five years through fiscal 2025.\nThe financing structure reveals the current constraints. Equity capital flows into renewable projects where India permits full foreign ownership, but debt creates a bottleneck. Banks face sectoral exposure limits, restricting how much they can lend to specific industries.\nArjun Dutt, who leads climate finance work at CEEW, identified one mechanism that could help. “Introducing a carve out for renewable energy in the credit enhancement facility for corporate infrastructure bonds announced in the last Union Budget could help stimulate the domestic green bond market,” he said. Refinancing existing loans through bond markets would free banking capital for new projects. These tools work better when they are offered on concessional terms, Dutt said.\nHeavily polluting industries present a more difficult proposition. Steel and cement account for over 80% of India’s climate investment needs by 2030 because they require expensive technologies in order to decarbonise. The investment case here demands longer timeframes and patient capital willing to accept both technology and market risk.\nPragmatic approach required\nDutt suggested that India approaches its international commitments pragmatically. The voluntary commitments should be split into two, he said. Unconditional targets would reflect what the country can achieve using domestic resources and organic foreign capital flows. Conditional targets would be more ambitious, dependent on accessing affordable international climate finance.\nIn all scenarios, multilateral development banks remain central to any solution. However, it is evident that they are nowhere near ready for what is required. Assessments by the G20 and the World Bank itself show these institutions must triple their climate lending capacity to meet demand. Reforms to capital frameworks and new financing instruments might help. They will not be sufficient without deeper institutional transformation and sustained political backing.\nPolitics shape these discussions in ways technical assessments cannot capture. Amar Bhattacharya, a Brookings Institution fellow who co-authored the IHLEG report, acknowledged reaching even the $1.3 trillion target will be difficult despite being feasible. Recent political shifts have complicated matters. The US withdrawing from the Paris Agreement has contracted available climate finance, Bhattacharya said. He argued that this should not impede progress by other nations.\nDeveloping countries maintain that historical responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions justifies the burden falling on rich developed nations. They have been insisting at the climate conferences that finance should come without restrictive conditions that constrain development priorities. This approach reflects the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities embedded in international climate negotiations. It also reflects trust deficits accumulated over years of unfulfilled commitments.\nGap between intent and delivery\nThe loss and damage fund demonstrates the gap between stated intentions and actual delivery. Established at recent climate summits to support countries facing the severest climate impacts they contributed nothing to cause, the fund has collected pledges of $788.8 million as of mid-2025. For nations like Bangladesh and Pacific island states seeing significant climate losses, the sum represents a mere fraction of requirements.\nYamide Dagnet of the Natural Resources Defense Council sees potential in the fund’s structure, which focuses on country-owned solutions. The approach matters, she said. “We are at a turning point where we need to make the economic case for adaptation and loss and damage funding, as strong, if not stronger, than the business case for investment in clean energy growth pathways,” Dagnet said. The adaptation finance gap documented by the UN Environment Programme shows how little reaches the most vulnerable regions relative to demonstrated need.\nCurrent global climate finance flows total some $190 billion annually, according to the Climate Policy Initiative's 2024 figures. Reaching the $1.3 trillion target requires increasing flows nearly sevenfold within a decade, which is tough, if not impossible, task.\nThe arithmetic is straightforward. Execution demands mobilizing public finance, reforming multilateral institutions, reducing investment risk, and aligning competing national interests.\nAs negotiations continue in Belém, the test is whether countries can move from setting targets to building mechanisms that channel trillions where required. The decisions being made will shape economic trajectories for developing nations attempting to balance growth with emission reductions. They will determine whether climate finance becomes the transformation engine it needs to be, or remains another area where commitments exceed delivery.",

        "full_content": "Budgets are usually tallied in rupees, but Shaitan Singh Songira, a 44-year-old farmer from Rajasthan’s Sirohi district, demonstrates how the same discipline can be applied to water. As the president of his village’s water committee, he presides over a fragile equilibrium; weighing how much his community can draw now without depriving itself in the future. He measures fields not just in harvests, but in the worth of water that nurtures them.\nReimagining Water Usage in Agriculture\nFor generations, farmers had equated abundance of water with abundance of crops and, by extension, more income. Songira showed them that prosperity could be multiplied even with the same amount of water. Farmers who once inundated their crops with little regard, now practise frugal watering, convinced that restraint can coexist with prosperity. Their experience underscores a larger truth: the endurance of communities, and the livelihoods they sustain, will depend on how optimally water is used.\nIndia holds 18 per cent of the world’s population, yet has access to barely 4 per cent of global freshwater. Agriculture alone consumes more than four-fifths of the nation’s water, and is deeply intertwined with both water availability and economic well-being. Scarcity here is not an ecological concept but a tangible economic deficit.\nA Threat to Both Ecology and Economy\nIndia irrigates extensively but wastefully, using two-to-threefold more water per tonne of crop compared to its global counterparts. Productivity is still gauged by output per hectare rather than efficiency per unit of water. The result is deceptive abundance: farmers harvest more, but their incomes remain precarious as groundwater declines and energy costs of pumping rise. The question one should ask is not “How much can I grow per hectare?” but rather, “How much income can I derive per litre of water?” Reconceptualising efficiency can recast water as a generator of livelihoods rather than a constraint upon them. Taking a ‘One Water’ approach offers a structured pathway for this transition; recognising rainfall, rivers, and even reclaimed wastewater as components of a single interconnected cycle.\nClimate volatility – erratic monsoons, scorching temperatures, and intense, short-duration rainfall events – intensifies pressures on water resources and rural livelihoods. Farmers perceive this disruption viscerally: parched wells, heat-scorched crops, or sudden, unseasonal floods that strip fertile topsoil, yet fail to recognise one of the key underlying drivers – climate change. Farmers should be able to connect observable anomalies to the underlying root causes. It is our imperative to simplify technical concepts such as runoff and precipitation variability, enabling farmers to grasp the “why” behind their lived realities. Only then does informed action emerge, which can manifest in two forms: adaptation and mitigation.\nWater Management as Livelihood Security\nThe very water-budgeting that Songira applies was cultivated with support from industry experts. Through the ‘Water Security Programme’ implemented by the Centre for MicroFinance (CMF), an affiliate of Tata Trusts, his village water committee received structured guidance: crafting water security plans, technical and financial support, seeding water-augmentation and conservation systems, building capacity in panchayats and local institutions, leveraging government schemes, and ensuring quality drinking water. This illustrates a clear lesson: when empowered with knowledge, technical guidance, and institutional backing, people can learn to conserve resources, and more broadly, secure livelihoods, enhance resilience, and create a model for sustainable prosperity for others to emulate.\nIndividual and collective efforts need to address both supply augmentation and demand management. The supply-side measures, including watershed restoration and soil-moisture conservation, must converge with demand-side strategies like crop diversification and water use efficiency that prioritise thrift over excess.\nNo less a priority is cultivating an ethic of vigilance. Too often, water becomes a focus only when there’s news of cuts or shortages – suddenly everyone is alert, suddenly every drop counts. But why wait for a crisis? True sustainability comes with judicious use of water, whether scarcity looms or not. When communities internalise the value of water, every drop can be conserved and utilised with care. The ‘One Water, One Community’ model puts this into practice, organising villagers into committees like Nal Jal Samitis or Pani Samitis to plan, manage, and maintain local water systems. In Gharat, Rajasthan, women-led groups are mobilised to manage the local water scheme, collecting contributions from every household, maintaining accounts, making water security a shared responsibility. This collective action ensures the entire community is invested in long-term water security.\nThe implications extend well beyond agriculture. Water scarcity intersects with health, education, and gender equity. When women and adolescent girls traverse miles to fetch water, opportunities for income and schooling dwindle. When smallholders abandon their fields due to exhausted wells, urban migration intensifies, overburdening already stressed cities. Conversely, when water systems are secure, villages generate not only food but also stability, improving nutrition, reducing migration, and strengthening local economies. Water management, in essence, is livelihood management.\nCollective Responsibility in Sustainable Water Use\nIndia’s water discourse is steeped in apocalyptic narratives – wars over rivers, aquifers collapsing, rivers running dry. Scarcity, when recognized as a collective risk, can spark collective responsibility. Water is not a peripheral resource but the very bedrock of economic life. If the nation can adopt caution not merely in drought years but also in seasons of plenty, it can safeguard both ecology and economy. The choice is unambiguous: extract until exhaustion, or steward until sustainability. The former courts collapse, the latter promises continuity.\n(Divyang Waghela, Head of Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WaSH), Tata Trusts.)\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "Tokyo Stock Exchange Inc. is looking to strengthen its market for initial public offerings by pitching itself as a venue for cross-border listings by startups in Asia.\nThe exchange is offering help in fundraising and IPO preparations with partners including banks, auditors and venture capital funds in Asia. So far, 20 startups have been chosen for the initiative, its website shows, with half of them based in Singapore and Taiwan.\nIPOs have been booming across the region, with India setting a record last year and Hong Kong proceeds at a multiyear high. Tokyo is looking to carve out its own slice of the market, counting on its deep pools of liquidity being attractive for companies that are too small for the US market and are concerned with geopolitical risks in Hong Kong.\n“We are looking to have as many companies whose shares keep rising over a long period as possible and that’s not limited to Japanese firms,” Tokyo Stock Exchange President Moriyuki Iwanaga said.\nThe plan may result in more than 20 cross-border IPOs in the next three years, according to Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corp., one of the partners in the initiative. That compares with just four such deals in 2023-2025, according to the bourse’s website.\n“Liquidity after listing is significantly important for companies as management engages with shareholders and stakeholders to raise corporate value,” said Atsushi Takahashi, a senior manager at the trust bank.\nTonik Financial Pte., a Mizuho Bank Ltd.-backed digital bank based in the Philippines that joined the TSE’s initiative, is actively exploring listing in Tokyo in the next two or three years, founder Greg Krasnov said, citing the access to liquidity and investor base specifically.\nSome companies are also weighing a Tokyo IPO as they look to expand in Japan, especially in the entertainment and tourism industries.\n“So many Asians love to go to Japan,” said Ming Chen, chief executive officer of KKday, an online travel platform operator based in Taiwan, which generates about half of its revenue from Japan. “If we can list in Japan, we can build more trust with our suppliers, local partners.”\nThe bourse failed to achieve its goal to list 20 cross-border companies in its mid-term management plan from April 2022 to March 2025, with only five such deals, including e-commerce platform operator Anymind Group Inc. and space technology company Astroscale Holdings Inc. according to its website.\nThe bourse is also looking at cross-border IPOs as a way to beef up its pipeline. Tokyo is considering raising the bar for companies to stay in the public market to ensure the growth of listed firms.",

Retail investors continue to lead the numbers, having booked their reserved portion nearly 1.64 times so far despite falling GMP.\nThe initial public offering of the company received bids for 5.33 crore shares, as against an offer size of nearly 8.91 crore shares, according to data on NSE. Non Institutional Investors (NII) have booked 33 percent of the portion kept for them, while Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB) have subscribed 38 percent of their reserved portion.\nShadowfax IPO GMP:\nAhead of listing, the unlisted shares of Shadowfax Tech were trading with 0.81 percent grey market premium (GMP) over the IPO price, according to data on Investorgain. This is lower than the 8.06 percent GMP quoted by the site during the weekend, and 3.23 percent quoted yesterday.\nAccording to IPO Watch, the unlisted shares of the company were trading with 3.23 percent GMP over the IPO price.\nAbout Shadowfax IPO:\nBengaluru-based technology-led logistics solutions provider Shadowfax Tech moved to the primary capital market to raise Rs 1,907.2 crore through its initial public offering (IPO), which comprises a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 1,000 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of shares worth Rs 907.2 crore by several investors including Flipkart, Eight Roads Investments, Qualcomm, and NewQuest Asia Fund.\nThe price band for the IPO has been set at Rs 118-124 per share. Investors can bid for a minimum of 120 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,160, and in multiples thereafter.\nThe IPO will remain open for public bidding between January 20 and January 22. The allotments are likely to be finalized by January 23, and the shares are scheduled to be listed on stock exchanges on January 28.\nHow will the IPO proceeds be used?\nThe company proposes to utilise proceeds from the fresh issue towards funding enhancing capacity in terms of network infrastructure, funding of lease payments for new first mile, last mile, and sort centres, as well as towards branding, marketing, and communication initiatives, unidentified inorganic acquisitions, and general corporate purposes.\nShadowfax IPO anchor book:\nA day before the IPO opened for public bidding, Shadowfax announced that it has raised Rs 856.02 crore from 39 anchor investors on January 19.\n\"Out of the total allocation, 3.67 crore equity shares worth Rs 455.73 crore were allocated to nine domestic mutual funds including ICICI Prudential AMC, Nippon Life India, Motilal Oswal AMC, Bandhan Mutual Fund, HSBC MF, Helios MF, JM Financial MF, and Trust Mutual Fund,\" Shadowfax Technologies in its filing to exchanges said.\nICICI Prudential AMC was the largest investor in the anchor book, acquiring 1.53 crore equity shares for Rs 190 crore through its four schemes - ICICI Prudential Flexicap Fund, ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage Fund, ICICI Prudential Transportation and Logistics Fund, and ICICI Prudential Exports and Services Fund.\nShould you apply for Shadowfax IPO?\nThe Indian logistics industry is entering a strong growth phase, driven by the rapid expansion of online retail and quick commerce, said Master Capital Services. It added that the industry is valued at Rs 21-23 trillion in FY2025, reflecting its scale and importance in supporting trade and consumption.\nOnline retail is the fastest growing channel in organized retail and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 20-25% from FY25 to FY30, the brokerage said, adding that within this, quick commerce is the fastest growing segment, expected to expand at an exceptional CAGR of 50-62% till FY30, highlighting rising consumer demand for faster and on-demand deliveries.\nE-commerce (excluding quick commerce) accounted for around 6% of the total Indian retail market in FY2025 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 15–20%, reaching a 9–10% market share by FY30, Master Capital Services said, adding that the number of online shoppers in India is also expected to grow at an 8–10% CAGR by FY30, providing a strong volume base for logistics services.\n“In this evolving landscape, Shadowfax Technologies Ltd is strategically positioned as a technology-led 3PL platform, enabling scalable, reliable, and time-sensitive logistics solutions across e-commerce, quick commerce, and hyperlocal delivery. With strong exposure to high-growth segments and a digital-first operating model, the company stands to benefit significantly from the structural growth of India’s logistics ecosystem. Investors may consider the IPO as a potential long-term investment opportunity,” the brokerage said.\nGaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk, noted that Shadowfax offers a compelling play on India’s rapidly growing e-commerce and quick-commerce ecosystem. \"With pan-India reach across over 14,700 pincodes and a client roster that includes Flipkart, Meesho, Swiggy, Zomato, and Blinkit, the company has demonstrated strong revenue growth (~32% CAGR FY23–25) and operational scalability through its large gig-based delivery network. Its asset-light model and EBITDA-positive performance since FY24 highlight its improving profitability trajectory,\" the analyst said.\nHe however cautioned that investors should be mindful of the risks and structural constraints. \"Margins remain thin, ROE and ROCE are modest, and revenue is concentrated with its top client contributing around 50%. At the upper price band, the IPO implies an EV/EBITDA of ~106x, which is rich compared with peers, suggesting that current valuations already reflect significant growth expectations,\" he said.\nOverall, Shadowfax offers long-term exposure to India’s logistics and hyperlocal delivery sector, but the IPO is better suited for investors with a long-term horizon, who are comfortable tracking execution, client diversification, and margin expansion over time, the analyst said. He added that for short-term listing gains, the risk-reward appears balanced but neutral.\nFollow all IPO news here.",

        "full_content": "As India’s digital commerce story widens beyond large online marketplaces to include hyperlocal retail and quick commerce, Shadowfax believes it is well placed to ride the next phase of growth in logistics.\nSpeaking exclusively to Moneycontrol, Vaibhav Khandelwal, Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Shadowfax, pointed to India’s still-low digital penetration as a key opportunity. Online commerce accounts for only about 7 percent of overall consumption, and the number of orders per person remains a fraction of what is seen in mature markets such as the US and China. “That gap itself creates a long runway,” he said, adding that growth is expected across express, hyperlocal and quick commerce deliveries.\nStrong revenue momentum, focus on diversification:\nShadowfax has posted a revenue CAGR of over 30 percent between FY23 and FY25, with growth accelerating to 68 percent in the first half of FY26. While management stopped short of offering guidance, it attributed the momentum to a conscious push towards more specialised, value-added services rather than just chasing volumes.\nThe company continues to draw a large share of its business from platforms such as Flipkart and Meesho, a factor investors are closely watching. Khandelwal acknowledged the concentration but said the dependence has been easing gradually. Large clients helped Shadowfax build scale and nationwide infrastructure, he said, after which the focus has shifted to expanding business with D2C brands and smaller enterprises across the country.\nWhat sets Shadowfax apart?\nA big part of Shadowfax’s pitch lies in its value-added offerings — including reverse logistics, doorstep quality checks, open-box deliveries, express services and hyperlocal fulfilment. These, management said, involve solving more complex operational problems and require deeper technology and execution capabilities.\nExpress deliveries, in particular, have seen sharp traction, with Shadowfax’s market share rising to 23 percent from 8 percent in FY22. Hyperlocal and quick commerce deliveries, meanwhile, have a steady base level of demand, helping cushion seasonality.\nProfitability, margins and the road ahead:\nOn profitability, Shadowfax said its improving margins are being supported by express deliveries, hyperlocal and quick commerce, and premium services. The company said it has been profitable for the past 10 quarters, with adjusted EBITDA margins improving from about 1 percent in FY24 to 2.8 percent in H1 FY26. Khandelwal said the journey has been steady, moving from operational profitability to EBITDA and then PAT — with a longer-term ambition to approach early to mid-teens margin levels seen in mature markets.\nThe company added that its crowdsourced delivery model allows it to handle demand spikes without carrying high fixed costs, while keeping cash flows and working capital in check.\nValuation and capital discipline:\nValuations have been a point of debate across several recent IPOs, and Shadowfax is no exception. Market participants have flagged the company’s pricing as steep, particularly when compared with peers such as Blue Dart Express and Delhivery. At the upper end of the price band, Shadowfax is valued at over Rs 7,000 crore. Responding to these concerns, Khandelwal pointed to strong anchor investor participation, improving profitability and a technology-led business model as key factors supporting the valuation. He added that the company remains focused on disciplined capital allocation, prudent working capital management and selective acquisitions in niche, value-added segments.\nFollow all IPO news here.",

Global retail giant Walmart-owned digital payments firm filed draft papers with market regulator SEBI for IPO via the confidential pre-filing route in late September.\nSecond-largest New Economy IPO\nThe public listing of the Bengaluru-based payments giant sets the stage for the second-largest new economy listing after rival Paytm’s IPO in late 2021. Noida-based Paytm’s IPO valuation was around $20 billion, with the IPO size of around Rs 18,000 crore.\nFood and grocery delivery platform Swiggy’s IPO size was around $1.35 billion, with the company raising Rs 11,300 crore in November 2024.\nDominant player in UPI\nPhonePe has around 45 percent market share in the mobile payments platform, UPI, with its nearest competitor, Google Pay, holding around 35 percent market share. More than 85 percent of the country’s digital payments are processed by the UPI platform.\nThe consistent dominance of the UPI space, even as the payment platform continues to see new entrants with deep pockets, is what makes PhonePe’s IPO bid strong.  The continued growth of the platform, along with newer use cases and strong innovation, makes UPI an unrivalled platform for digital payments in the country.\nPhonePe processes close to 10 billion transactions worth over Rs 12 lakh crore every month.\nThe company also has multiple other verticals, from a stock market trading app share.market, lending platform and sale of insurance policies, among others.\nDespite diversification, payments continue to anchor PhonePe’s growth, accounting for over 90 per cent of its total revenue.\nSellers in the IPO\nWalmart, Tiger Global and Microsoft are the three shareholders looking to participate in the offer for sale, which will involve a combined dilution of around 10 per cent stake.\nKotak Mahindra Capital, Citi, Morgan Stanley, and JP Morgan, as advisors for a big-bang IPO, were targeting a listing valuation of up to $15 billion.\nFintech IPOs\nWhile Paytm’s IPO was fully subscribed at $20-billion valuation and Rs 18,000-crore fundraising, its valuation plummeted soon after as multiple analysts downgraded the stock. Paytm’s current valuation is around $9.5 billion.\nWealth-tech platform Groww listed late last year at around $7.5-billion valuation and is now trading at a valuation of around $10.5 billion.\nInsurance marketplace PB Fintech IPO has been a big success, with the company’s current valuation at around $9 billion, compared with the $6 billion it listed at.\nThe initial public offering (IPO) of Pine Labs closed for public subscription on November 11 after being subscribed nearly 2.5 times its offer size on its third and final day of bidding.  The total issue size is estimated at Rs 3,900 crore.

The maiden public issue of the company has been subscribed 47 percent on Day 1.\nThe initial public offering of the company received bids for 4.18 crore shares, as against an offer size of nearly 8.91 crore shares, according to data on NSE. Retail investors have shown the most interest in the IPO so far, fully-booking their reserved portion (111 percent).\nNon Institutional Investors (NII) have booked 22 percent of the portion kept for them, while Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB) have subscribed 38 percent of their reserved portion.\nShadowfax IPO GMP:\nAhead of listing, the unlisted shares of Shadowfax Tech were trading with 3.23 percent grey market premium (GMP) over the IPO price, according to data on Investorgain. This is lower than the 8.06 percent GMP quoted by the site a day before yesterday, and 4.84 percent quoted yesterday.\nAccording to IPO Watch, the unlisted shares of the company were trading with 4.84 percent GMP over the IPO price.\nAbout Shadowfax IPO:\nBengaluru-based technology-led logistics solutions provider Shadowfax Tech moved to the primary capital market to raise Rs 1,907.2 crore through its initial public offering (IPO), which comprises a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 1,000 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of shares worth Rs 907.2 crore by several investors including Flipkart, Eight Roads Investments, Qualcomm, and NewQuest Asia Fund.\nThe price band for the IPO has been set at Rs 118-124 per share. Investors can bid for a minimum of 120 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,160, and in multiples thereafter.\nThe IPO will remain open for public bidding between January 20 and January 22. The allotments are likely to be finalized by January 23, and the shares are scheduled to be listed on stock exchanges on January 28.\nHow will the IPO proceeds be used?\nThe company proposes to utilise proceeds from the fresh issue towards funding enhancing capacity in terms of network infrastructure, funding of lease payments for new first mile, last mile, and sort centres, as well as towards branding, marketing, and communication initiatives, unidentified inorganic acquisitions, and general corporate purposes.\nShadowfax IPO anchor book:\nA day before the IPO opened for public bidding, Shadowfax announced that it has raised Rs 856.02 crore from 39 anchor investors on January 19.\n\"Out of the total allocation, 3.67 crore equity shares worth Rs 455.73 crore were allocated to nine domestic mutual funds including ICICI Prudential AMC, Nippon Life India, Motilal Oswal AMC, Bandhan Mutual Fund, HSBC MF, Helios MF, JM Financial MF, and Trust Mutual Fund,\" Shadowfax Technologies in its filing to exchanges said.\nICICI Prudential AMC was the largest investor in the anchor book, acquiring 1.53 crore equity shares for Rs 190 crore through its four schemes - ICICI Prudential Flexicap Fund, ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage Fund, ICICI Prudential Transportation and Logistics Fund, and ICICI Prudential Exports and Services Fund.\nShould you apply for Shadowfax IPO?\nThe Indian logistics industry is entering a strong growth phase, driven by the rapid expansion of online retail and quick commerce, said Master Capital Services. It added that the industry is valued at Rs 21-23 trillion in FY2025, reflecting its scale and importance in supporting trade and consumption.\nOnline retail is the fastest growing channel in organized retail and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 20-25% from FY25 to FY30, the brokerage said, adding that within this, quick commerce is the fastest growing segment, expected to expand at an exceptional CAGR of 50-62% till FY30, highlighting rising consumer demand for faster and on-demand deliveries.\nE-commerce (excluding quick commerce) accounted for around 6% of the total Indian retail market in FY2025 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 15–20%, reaching a 9–10% market share by FY30, Master Capital Services said, adding that the number of online shoppers in India is also expected to grow at an 8–10% CAGR by FY30, providing a strong volume base for logistics services.\n“In this evolving landscape, Shadowfax Technologies Ltd is strategically positioned as a technology-led 3PL platform, enabling scalable, reliable, and time-sensitive logistics solutions across e-commerce, quick commerce, and hyperlocal delivery. With strong exposure to high-growth segments and a digital-first operating model, the company stands to benefit significantly from the structural growth of India’s logistics ecosystem. Investors may consider the IPO as a potential long-term investment opportunity,” the brokerage said.\nGaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk, noted that Shadowfax offers a compelling play on India’s rapidly growing e-commerce and quick-commerce ecosystem. \"With pan-India reach across over 14,700 pincodes and a client roster that includes Flipkart, Meesho, Swiggy, Zomato, and Blinkit, the company has demonstrated strong revenue growth (~32% CAGR FY23–25) and operational scalability through its large gig-based delivery network. Its asset-light model and EBITDA-positive performance since FY24 highlight its improving profitability trajectory,\" the analyst said.\nHe however cautioned that investors should be mindful of the risks and structural constraints. \"Margins remain thin, ROE and ROCE are modest, and revenue is concentrated with its top client contributing around 50%. At the upper price band, the IPO implies an EV/EBITDA of ~106x, which is rich compared with peers, suggesting that current valuations already reflect significant growth expectations,\" he said.\nOverall, Shadowfax offers long-term exposure to India’s logistics and hyperlocal delivery sector, but the IPO is better suited for investors with a long-term horizon, who are comfortable tracking execution, client diversification, and margin expansion over time, the analyst said. He added that for short-term listing gains, the risk-reward appears balanced but neutral.\nFollow all IPO news here.",

        "full_content": "The shares of UltraTech Cement jumped nearly 4 percent on January 27 after the company released better than expected results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. Brokerages have issued bullish calls for the stock.\nThe shares of the cement-maker jumped to Rs 12,825.00 apiece in the morning trading hours of Tuesday. This is the highest level seen by the stock since early September last year.\nUltraTech Cement Q3 Results:\nUltraTech Cement on January 24 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,725.40 crore attributable to the firm’s owners for the third quarter of the ongoing financial year 2025. This marks a 27 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from the Rs 1,359.43 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25.\nNotably, the net profit reported during the quarter included an exceptional item of Rs 88.48 crore due to the one-time impact of the New Labour Codes which took effect from November 21.\nThe firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile grew around 23 percent YoY to Rs 21,829.68 crore in Q3 FY26, from Rs 17,778.83 crore in Q3 FY25. Its consolidated sales volumes grew 15 percent to 38.87 mtpa during the quarter under review.\nJM Financial on UltraTech Cement:\nJM Financial said that UltraTech Cement reported a strong Q3 FY26 earnings performance with consolidated EBITDA rising 35 percent YoY to Rs 3,920 crore, beating its estimates primarily due to lower-than-estimated cost/tn.\n“Management highlighted robust demand momentum is likely to sustain supported by infra projects. The industry has taken price hikes in Jan’26 and anticipates further price hike likely supported by improving demand. We argue UltraTech is poised for structural improvement in return ratios over the next three–four years owing to: i) rising asset turnover; ii) low cost of expansion; and iii) improving profitability. Factoring in the 3Q performance and improving demand/pricing, we are increasing EBITDA by 6% for FY26E and 1–3% for FY27E–28E,” the brokerage said.\nIt maintained its ‘Buy’ rating on the stock, while raising its target price to Rs 14,500 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 17 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.\nChoice Broking on UltraTech Cement:\nChoice Institutional Equities said that it continues to remain positive on UltraTech Cement due to ambitious and continuous capacity expansion plan to add 8 mnt of capacity in Q4 FY26, and 12 mnt in FY27, funding expansion outlay largely via internal accruals, proactive cost-optimisation strategy, favourable sectoral pricing environment and significant demand growth in expected from the southern market.\nThe domestic brokerage maintained its ‘Buy’ rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 15,210 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 23 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.\nMotilal Oswal on UltraTech Cement:\nMotilal Oswal said that UltraTech Cement’s Q3 FY26 EBITDA was above its estimate, led by higher-than-estimated volume growth and lower-than-estimated opex/t. “Management indicated a positive demand outlook, highlighting a multi-year infrastructure pipeline across all regions, led by roads, metros, railways, ports, airports and housing segments,” the brokerage noted.\n“We largely maintain our FY26 EBITDA estimate and raise FY27/28 EBITDA estimates by 4% each, considering high volume growth vs. previous estimates. We increase our FY27/28 EPS estimates by ~5% each. We value UTCEM at 18x FY28E EV/EBITDA to arrive at a TP of INR14,200. Reiterate BUY,” it added.\nUltraTech Cement share price:\nUltraTech Cement shares have gained more than 7 percent in the past one month, and over 6 percent in 2026 so far.\nFollow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "The shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank tumbled more than 5 percent on January 27 after the company released its results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. Brokerages have mixed views for the stock, with some cutting forecasts after the lender’s earnings missed estimates.\nThe shares of the heavyweight lender dropped to Rs 400.5 apiece, recording the sharpest single-day fall since July 2025.\nKotak Mahindra Q3 Results:\nKotak Mahindra Bank on January 24 reported a standalone net profit of Rs 3,446.14 crore for Q3 FY26. This marks a 4 percent year-on-year increase from the Rs 3,305 crore net profit reported in the same quarter of the previous financial year.\nThe bank's results missed estimates, as analysts had expected a profit of Rs 3,572 crore, according to data compiled by LSEG.\nNet Interest Income (NII) increased more than 5 percent YoY to Rs 7,565 crore during the quarter under review, from Rs 7,196 crore a year ago. However, net interest margin (NIM) declined to 4.54 percent from 4.93 percent in the third quarter of the previous financial year.\nAsset quality slightly improved sequentially, with gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio moderating to 1.30 percent as on December 31, 2025, from 1.50 percent a year ago. Net NPA also eased to 0.31 per cent from 0.41 per cent at the end of December 2024.\nHDFC Securities on Kotak Mahindra Bank:\nHDFC Securities noted that Kotak Mahindra Bank’s Q3 earnings were below estimates, as flattish margins, soft traction in fee income, and relatively high opex intensity was partly offset by higher growth on both sides of the balance sheet.\n“Healthy loan growth (16% YoY) was driven by mortgages, business banking, SME segments. Deposit growth (~14% YoY) was strong with CASA ratio at 41.3% (-101bps QoQ) and softer than usual traction in CA balances. While the stress in unsecured segments has largely abated, stress in retail CV segment remains elevated. We are constructive on KMB, expecting growth momentum to sustain in RoA-accretive segments such as LAP, CV/CE, tractors, business banking, and SME, concomitantly reshaping its unsecured segment strategy,” the domestic brokerage said.\nIt cut the lender’s FY26E/FY27E earnings forecasts by 5/2 percent, factoring in softer margins and fee income. It maintained its ‘Buy’ rating for the stock, with a target price of Rs 495 apiece, implying an upside potential of more than 17 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.\nWhile growth is picking up, higher opex was seen after four quarters of managing it well, noted CLSA. Emkay meanwhile expects Kotak Mahindra Bank to report a relatively moderate RoA of 1.9 percent in FY26E, albeit with an improvement to 2 percent in FY27/FY28E as margins and loss -loss provisions normalize\nMotilal Oswal on Kotak Mahindra Bank:\nMotilal Oswal said the lender’s NII and other income stood largely in line with its estimates. Operating expenses came in higher than anticipated, while provisions were lower than estimates.\n“The decline in the unsecured portfolio has now been arrested, and the bank has reiterated its guidance for stronger growth in the coming quarters, which should also support margins. Overall loan growth is guided at 1.5-2.0x nominal GDP, driven by stable momentum in retail and unsecured segments. Given the continued growth traction, we believe the bank is well positioned to deliver a healthy ~16% loan CAGR over FY26-28E,” the domestic brokerage said.\nMotilal maintained its earnings estimate, along with a ‘Buy’ call on the stock with a target price of Rs 500 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 18 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.\nKotak Mahindra Bank share price:\nKotak Mahindra Bank shares have fallen more than 5 percent in the past one month, but gained around 4 percent in the past six months.\nThe stock which currently has a P/E ratio of 22.50, is currently the top loser on benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty, as well as the Nifty Bank index.\nFollow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "Shares of Adani Group companies rebounded sharply by up to 5 percent in early trade on Tuesday, January 27, with Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone emerging among the top gainers on the Nifty. The recovery in Adani group stocks today follows a steep selloff in the previous session triggered by US regulatory developments.\nAdani Enterprises shares rose nearly 5 percent to around Rs 1,955, while Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone gained over 4 percent to Rs 1,363, placing both stocks among the top of the Nifty gainers’ list in morning trade. The rebound follows a sharp decline on Friday, January 23, when Adani group stocks fell as much as 14 percent amid reports that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had sought court permission to serve legal summons on billionaire Gautam Adani and group executive Sagar Adani.\nOther Adani group stocks also traded higher on Tuesday. Adani Green Energy advanced nearly 4 percent to about Rs 802, Adani Energy Solutions rose close to 4 percent to around Rs 844, and Adani Power was up over 2 percent at roughly Rs 136.\nEarlier, on January 23, Adani Enterprises had closed nearly 11 percent lower, its lowest level since May 19, 2023. Adani Green Energy stock had slumped more than 14 percent, while Adani Ports had ended the session down about 7 percent. Adani Energy Solutions had fallen 10 percent, marking its biggest single-day percentage drop since November 21, 2024.\nThe selloff was sparked by reports that the SEC had asked a US court for permission to directly email summons to Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani in connection with an alleged fraud and a USD 265 million bribery scheme. According to Reuters, the SEC told the court that it did not expect service to be completed through existing channels after India declined two earlier requests to serve the summons.\nAdani Group has rejected the allegations, calling them “baseless”, and has said it would pursue “all possible legal recourse”. In June, Gautam Adani had stated that “despite all the noise”, no one from the Adani Group had been charged with violating the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or conspiring to obstruct justice.\nSeparately, Adani Enterprises informed stock exchanges that it is not a party to the legal proceedings referenced in recent media reports and that the matter does not trigger any disclosure requirements under India’s listing regulations. Responding to queries from BSE and NSE following a media report, the company said there are “no allegations made against the Company” and that it is not involved in the proceedings cited. It added that the reported developments do not have any bearing on its disclosure or compliance obligations under SEBI regulations.\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "Shares of Axis Bank Ltd jumped nearly 4 percent in early trade on Tuesday, January 27, after the private sector lender reported a better-than-expected results for Q3 FY26. The strong financial performance drew a string of bullish brokerage responses on earnings visibility, asset quality and valuations.\nAxis Bank stock was trading at Rs 1,306.6, up 3.86 percent, extending its strong run over the past year. The stock has gained 37.3 percent over the last 12 months, sharply outperforming the Nifty 50, which is up about 9.7 percent over the same period.\nAxis Bank Q3 results beat estimates\nAxis Bank reported a 3 percent year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 6,489.6 crore for Q3 FY26, beating the CNBC-TV18 poll estimate of Rs 6,046 crore. Net interest income grew 5 percent on-year to Rs 14,286.4 crore, also ahead of Street expectations, reflecting steady core lending performance.\nAsset quality improved sequentially, with gross NPAs easing to 1.40 percent from 1.46 percent in the September quarter and net NPAs declining to 0.42 percent from 0.44 percent. In absolute terms, gross NPAs fell quarter-on-quarter, while net NPAs edged up marginally.\nAxis Bank stock call: Brokerages turn more bullish\nBrokerages were largely positive on the stock outlook, citing improving credit cost visibility, resilient profitability metrics and attractive valuations.\nCiti upgraded Axis Bank to a ‘Buy’ and raised its target price to Rs 1,436, implying an upside of over 14 percent. Citi highlighted another core earnings beat and return on assets of around 1.5 percent. The brokerage flagged stable slippages despite agricultural seasonality, lower-than-expected credit costs and improved cost efficiency, even as treasury gains and fee income remained muted.\nCLSA maintained its ‘Outperform’ rating with a target price of Rs 1,500, calling asset quality the key highlight of the quarter. It noted that excluding technical slippages, gross slippages declined sharply on-year, driven by unsecured retail credit, while credit costs came in below estimates.\nBernstein, which has an ‘Outperform’ rating and a target of Rs 1,480, described the quarter as mixed, with healthy loan and deposit growth offset by margin pressure and elevated credit costs. Still, it said return on assets was sustained at around 1.5 percent.\nNomura reiterated its ‘Buy’ call with a target price of Rs 1,540, pointing to improving credit cost visibility and strengthening growth trends. The brokerage expects return on assets of 1.7-1.8 percent and return on equity of around 15 percent over FY27-28, with earnings CAGR estimated at 26 percent.\nHSBC also maintained a ‘Buy’ rating, setting a target price of Rs 1,580, and said the upgrade thesis was playing out as expected, supported by sharp improvement in credit costs and strong growth and margin performance. Jefferies retained its ‘Buy’ call with a target of Rs 1,550, citing a profit beat driven by stronger topline, lower credit costs and controlled operating expenses.\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "Asian equities edged lower as tariff concerns resurfaced after President Donald Trump threatened to raise levies on South Korean goods. The yen held its gains.\nThe Kospi Index, one of the world’s best-performing benchmarks this year, fell 0.9%, while the South Korean won weakened after four days of gains. Japanese shares fell for a second day, weighed down by a stronger yen.\nThe yen traded near around 154 per dollar after gaining on the greenback over the past two sessions amid speculation the US may coordinate intervention with Japan. A gauge of the dollar was steady Tuesday, hovering around levels last seen in 2022. Gold and silver also traded near their record highs on Tuesday.\nWhile much of the market’s focus has been on currencies and the risk of yen intervention, tariff concerns have also resurfaced after Trump warned of 100% levies on Canada. The added uncertainty comes in a pivotal week for investors, with megacap technology earnings set to test whether the artificial-intelligence driven rally can be sustained.\n“Tech has become more of a show-me story,” said Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer for wealth and investment management at Wells Fargo, which manages $2.3 trillion. “If Big Tech can continue to deliver, I think capital will start flowing in tech’s direction again.”\nIn the US, companies accounting for roughly a third of the S&P 500’s market capitalization report this week.\nThe US president has ratcheted up trade tensions with several allies in recent weeks, threatening to raise duties on Canadian products to 100% if Ottawa signed a trade deal with China. Trump attributed a 25% tariff hike on South Korean goods to the country’s legislature failing to codify a trade agreement reached with the US last year.\nTrump had earlier threatened to slap new charges on European countries’ goods over his quest to seize control of Greenland. He then backed off.\nMeanwhile, the yen’s gains remained in focus after comments from Japanese officials fueled speculation that the government may intervene in the market to prevent the currency from resuming its slide. To some, however, the recent rally has partly neutralized the likelihood of intervention.\n“The dramatic recovery in the yen suggests that actual intervention is not needed,” said Marc Chandler at Bannockburn Capital Markets.\nElsewhere, US power grids are under mounting pressure following a winter storm that unleashed deep cold and heavy snow and ice from Texas to Maine. That’s knocked an estimated 12% of US natural gas production off-line and forecasts for frigid weather caused prices to soar.\nUS natural gas prices jumped around 30%.\nTreasuries remained in a narrow range on Monday with the Federal Reserve expected to pause its rate cuts when it announces its policy on Wednesday.\nFed officials are expected to hold rates steady following three straight cuts at the end of 2025, as a steadier jobs market restores a degree of consensus at the central bank after months of growing division. Chair Jerome Powell is likely to telegraph his view that policy is well-positioned for now, but refrain from signaling much about where rates are headed.\nExpectations about Fed policy have been shifting in response to changes in the consensus view on whom Trump will nominate to succeed Powell, whose term expires in May.\n“Even though the Fed isn’t expected to cut interest rates, Powell’s press conference may be as much about Fed independence as it is policy,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.",

        "full_content": "Equity benchmarks slipped nearly 1 percent on January 23, with the Nifty 50 now trading below all key moving averages. Market breadth was favourable for bears, with about 2,233 shares declining against 702 advancing shares on the NSE. Consolidation with range-bound trading is expected to continue over the next few sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:\nRajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities\nTech Mahindra | CMP: Rs 1,701.1\nOn the daily and weekly charts, Tech Mahindra is trending higher, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms, indicating a short- to medium-term uptrend. On the weekly chart, the stock has confirmed a down-sloping trendline breakout at the Rs 1,640 level along with huge volumes, indicating increased participation.\nThe stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100- and 200-day SMA, which reconfirms the bullish trend. The daily, weekly and monthly strength RSI is in positive territory, signalling rising strength. The daily and weekly Bollinger Band signals indicate increased price movement.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 1,800, Rs 1,850\nStop-Loss: Rs 1,640\nBank of India | CMP: 159.65\nOn the weekly chart, Bank of India has confirmed a “multiple resistance” breakout at the Rs 154 level on a closing basis, along with huge volumes, which signifies bullish sentiment. The stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100- and 200-day SMA, and these averages are also inching up along with rising prices, which reconfirms a bullish trend. The weekly and monthly strength RSI is in positive territory, signalling rising strength.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 180, Rs 185\nStop-Loss: Rs 154\nPG Electroplast | CMP: Rs 510.35\nOn the daily and weekly charts, PG Electroplast is in a downtrend, forming a series of lower tops and bottom formations. It has also decisively broken a 5–6 month up-sloping trendline on a closing basis, along with huge volumes, indicating selling pressure. The stock is sustaining below its 50-, 100- and 200-day SMAs, which reconfirms a short-term downtrend.\nThe daily, weekly and monthly strength indicator RSI remains weak, indicating continued weakness in the recent downturn. Investors should consider exiting long positions as well as initiating fresh shorts in this stock.\nStrategy: Sell\nTarget: Rs 470, Rs 450\nStop-Loss: Rs 550\nRajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One\nHindustan Unilever | CMP: Rs 2,409.50\nWhile the benchmark index Nifty ended the week with a decline of around 2.5 percent, Hindustan Unilever acted as a defensive outperformer, gaining nearly 2 percent during the week and exhibiting strong relative strength.\nOn the daily chart, prices are forming a bullish Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern and are placed above all major moving averages, which supports the buy view. Additionally, the smoothened RSI has generated a fresh buy signal, with a bullish crossover above its signal line on both the daily and weekly charts. Hence, we recommend buying Hindustan Unilever in the range of Rs 2,410–2,400.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 2,550\nStop-Loss: Rs 2,330\nMax Financial Services | CMP: Rs 1,599\nMax Financial Services has been trading in a range over the past three months and, after failing to cross the Rs 1,750 mark on two occasions, has now breached key support levels, confirming a topping-out formation in the form of a Double Top.\nPrices have also slipped below the crucial 89 DEMA, which earlier acted as support and now signals a change in polarity. On the indicator front, the RSI remains in the negative zone, further reinforcing the sell view. Hence, we recommend selling Max Financial Services around Rs 1,595.\nStrategy: Sell\nTarget: Rs 1,500\nStop-Loss: Rs 1,640\nAnshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments\nShriram Finance | CMP: Rs 1,003.55\nShriram Finance is forming a classic pole-and-flag structure on the daily chart, with the flag marked by low-volume sideways consolidation between Rs 961 and Rs 1,025.6. The contraction reflects healthy digestion after a strong impulsive pole, not distribution. Institutional volumes during the pole were clearly accumulative, lending credibility to the continuation setup.\nA pre-emptive long around Rs 1,003 offers a front-running opportunity with a favourable risk–reward ratio ahead of confirmation. However, real momentum acceleration will only emerge on a decisive breakout above Rs 1,025. A sustained breach of this ceiling is likely to unleash sharp follow-through buying, projecting an initial upside toward the Rs 1,100 zone. Until then, the flag structure remains constructive, with dips likely to be absorbed rather than sold.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 1,100\nStop-Loss: Rs 960\nBank of Maharashtra | CMP: Rs 65.63\nBank of Maharashtra is on the verge of resolving a powerful 371-day rounding base, with a very shallow handle making it a textbook cup-and-handle structure. The base has seen clear institutional accumulation, while the right-side development shows tight price action with sharply dried-up volumes, signalling calm before expansion. This contraction reflects absorption, not supply.\nThe breakout pivot is precisely placed at Rs 67.63, and a decisive breach with follow-through would confirm momentum ignition. Given the strength of the base, the move is likely to be fast and directional. On confirmation, the stock can propel toward the Rs 78–79 zone initially. With a pre-budget tailwind building across PSU banking names, the risk–reward favours an upside resolution, while failure to clear the pivot would only delay, not negate, the broader bullish structure.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 79\nStop-Loss: Rs 62\nUnion Bank of India | CMP: Rs 172.77\nUnion Bank of India has delivered a decisive breakout from a massive 2,002-day VCP (Volume Contraction Pattern) structure, marking a major long-term trend shift. Post breakout, the stock has paused into an eight-day tight flag, acting as a pit stop rather than exhaustion. This brief consolidation has allowed short-term indicators and momentum to cool off without damaging the structure.\nMoving averages across daily and weekly charts remain bullishly aligned and continue to act as a launchpad. The setup signals stored energy ahead of expansion. A clean breakout and sustain above Rs 176 would trigger the next momentum leg, opening an initial move toward Rs 189. Beyond that, the multi-year high near Rs 220 becomes the next logical zone where profit booking may emerge. Until then, the structure favours continuation over consolidation.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget; Rs 189, Rs 220\nStop-Loss: Rs 164",

Markets were closed for holidays Monday in Australia and India.\nThe advances mirror a powerful rally in metals markets, where gold, silver, copper and aluminum are climbing on what traders describe as a debasement trade. Investors are pulling away from currencies and Treasuries, seeking refuge in hard assets as concerns mount over fiscal largesse, geopolitics and the durability of US exceptionalism.\nThe rally in metals “is a long term trend that we have been observing for several years,” said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Societe Generale SA. Reasons include a diversification away from US assets and rising defense spending boosting demand for base metals as well as AI-related demand.",

Nifty on the weekly chart formed a long bear candle this week after the minor bounce of last week.

The surge, which mirrored international markets, is driven by escalating geopolitical concerns, a weakening rupee, robust industrial demand and strong speculative interest.\nThe India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA) pegged the metal's price at Rs 3,42,507 for a kilogram at 12:30 pm, up 7.38 percent from the previous day's close at Rs 3,18,960 on January 23.\nOn the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), silver futures surged to a new peak of Rs 3,68,398 at 1:09 pm.\nIn the international market, Comex spot silver surged to $113 per ounce, which is a 2.15 percent decline from the previous close.\nThe rupee was trading at 91.63 against the US dollar, down 0.04 percent from its previous close. A weak rupee has made imports and commodities more expensive.\nHere is how a kilogram of silver has moved.\nHow will silver prices move?\nThe Augmont Bullion, published on January 27, said silver has achieved $100 and $107 targets and may consolidate before resuming higher towards $120 (Rs 3,90,000). \"Key support is seen at $103 (Rs 3,40,000); a break could lead to retracement towards $100 and $97.\"\nRenewed geopolitical tensions have been a key trigger. The US President Donald Trump announced a 100 percent tariff threat on Canada over a potential trade deal with China and raised tariffs on South Korean autos, pharmaceuticals, and lumber to 25 percent. These developments have reinforced safe-haven demand.\n\"For precious metals this year, the dominant driver has been policy uncertainty under Trump.

        "full_content": "Gold rose, holding above $5,000 an ounce for a second day, as a weak dollar helped to extend a rally fueled by geopolitical risks and investor flight from sovereign bonds and currencies.\nBullion jumped as much as 1.1% early on Tuesday, its seventh straight day of gains. A gauge of the dollar fell to the lowest in nearly four years during the previous session, making gold more affordable for most buyers, while US President Donald Trump threatened to hike tariffs on South Korean goods to 25%.\nGold’s dramatic rally – the metal has more than doubled over the last two years – drives home bullion’s historic role as a gauge of fear in markets. Fresh from its best annual performance since 1979, it’s gained a further 17% so far this year due largely to the so-called debasement trade, whereby investors retreat from currencies and Treasuries. A massive selloff in the Japanese bond market is the latest example of investors rejecting heavy fiscal spending.\nIn recent weeks, the Trump administration’s actions — attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve, threats to annex Greenland, military intervention in Venezuela — have also shaken markets. The US leader’s warning to South Korea follows a threat to Canada over the weekend to impose 100% tariffs if Ottawa makes a trade deal with China.\nOptions traders are betting gold will rally further as investors diversify from American assets. Implied volatility of Comex gold futures climbed to the highest since the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, while volatility on State Street’s SPDR Gold Shares — the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund — has also broken out higher.\nLooking ahead, investors will also be keeping a close tab on the Federal Reserve’s actions on Wednesday, with the US central bank widely expected to halt its rate-cutting cycle as a steadier jobs market restores a degree of consensus after months of growing division.\nGold rose 0.9% to $5,051.50 an ounce as of 8:15 a.m. in Singapore. Silver advanced 3.6% to $107.49 an ounce, having hit an all-time high above $117.71 in the previous session before retreating.

        "full_content": "Analysts expect spot gold prices, which hit a record high above $5,000 per ounce on Monday, to climb further toward $6,000 this year on mounting global tensions as well as strong central-bank and retail demand.\nGold raced to a peak of $5,092.70 as geopolitical and economic risks rattled markets. The safe-haven metal is up more than 17% this year, after soaring 64% in 2025.\nThe London Bullion Market Association's annual precious metals forecast survey shows analysts projecting gold rising as high as $7,150 and averaging $4,742 in 2026.\nGoldman Sachs has raised its December 2026 gold price forecast to $5,400 from $4,900.\nIndependent analyst Ross Norman expects a high of $6,400 this year, with an average of $5,375.\n\"The only certainty at the moment seems to be uncertainty, and that's playing very much into gold's hands,\" Norman said.\nGEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS\nGold's recent rally has been fuelled by geopolitical tensions, from the U.S.–NATO friction over Greenland and tariff uncertainty to rising doubts over the independence of the U.S. Federal Reserve, among others.\n\"With the upcoming U.S. mid-term elections, political uncertainty may increase further. At the same time, persistent concerns about over-valued equity markets are likely to reinforce portfolio diversification flows into gold,\" said Philip Newman, a director at Metals Focus. [MKTS/GLOB]\n\"After crossing the $5,000/ounce milestone, we expect further upside,\" he added.\nROBUST CENTRAL BANK PURCHASES\nCentral-bank gold buying, a key driver of prices in 2025, is expected to stay strong this year.\nGoldman Sachs forecasts purchases to average 60 metric tons a month as emerging-market central banks continue diversifying reserves into gold.\nPoland's central bank, which held 550 tons of gold at end-2025, aims to lift reserves to 700 tons, Governor Adam Glapinski said this month.\nThese plans reaffirm the view that the key driver behind the spike in gold is central banks \"looking to de-dollarise ... and where else could you go except into gold?\" Norman said.\nChina's central bank extended its gold-buying spree for a 14th month in December.\nETF INFLOWS, RETAIL DEMAND\nInflows into gold-backed ETFs, which store bullion for investors and account for a significant amount of investment demand for the metal, are also underpinning prices as markets expect further U.S. rate cuts this year.\n\"There's an opportunity cost to holding gold which has no yield. As interest rates decline, so does this opportunity cost. If the Fed continues to lower rates in 2026, demand for gold should rise,\" said Chris Mancini, co-portfolio manager of the Gabelli Gold Fund.\nGold ETFs saw record inflows in 2025, led by North American funds, according to World Gold Council data, with annual inflows surging to $89 billion. In tonnage terms, inflows totalled 801 metric tons, the highest since their record in 2020.\nGold demand for jewellery has weakened amid high prices, partly offset by a strong appetite for small bars and coins in key markets such as India.\nBar-and-coin buying is also evident in Europe, though some investors are taking profit, analysts said.\nFor many retail investors, gold's appeal lies in its simplicity, said Frederic Panizzutti, global head of sales at Numismatica Genevensis, which trades precious metals coins.\n\"You don't need to analyse a balance sheet, assess credit risk or worry about a country or sovereign risk,\" he said. \"Your only risk with physical gold is the price direction. And as geopolitics and geoeconomics have become more complicated ... that simplicity has become more attractive.\"\nWHAT'S NEXT FOR GOLD?\nAnalysts say several factors could trigger a correction, including a pullback in U.S. rate-cut expectations, margin calls in equities, and easing concerns about Fed independence.\nHowever, most expect any pullback to be short-lived and treated as a buying opportunity.\n\"A meaningful and sustained decline in gold would require a return to a more stable economic and geopolitical backdrop, which currently appears unlikely,\" Newman added.",

The price hit the record Rs 1,58,899 per 10 grams on January 23, 2026.\nThe current rally has been driven by the likelihood of another rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, further lowering the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold.\nThe latest surge in gold prices improved in the aftermath of fresh tensions between the US and NATO over Greenland. The ongoing crisis in Ukraine and Gaza, and the US capture of the Venezuelan President, have also kept the price of gold high. On Saturday, the US President threatened a 100 percent tariff on Canada if it strikes a trade deal with China.\nMarket sentiment also improved with heightened expectations of monetary easing as Trump is expected to appoint the next Fed Chair, with markets pricing in a more dovish candidate.\nGold price outlook\nCommodity analysts now predict the price of yellow metal to hit $5,550 and up to $7,000 per ounce in the long term.\n\"Gold prices are trading at multi‑year highs, reflecting robust investor demand amid geopolitical and macro risks. In the short to mid term, gold is expected to climb another 10–20 percent, supported by persistent safe‑haven flows, continued central bank accumulation, and broad ETF inflows,” said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market, an online trading platform.\nRenisha Chainani, Head of Research at Augmont, also agrees that the price of gold in the short-to mid-term will likely remain firm with an upside bias. “Prices could move toward $5,500, with interim consolidation along the way.”\nCiting Fibonacci extension analysis, Apurva Sheth, Head of Market Research at Samco Securities, said that the next major target zone near $7,040 indicates further upside potential as the cycle progresses.\n“Looking ahead, while interim consolidations are natural after a strong run-up, the broader setup suggests gold remains well-positioned over the coming years. Overall, gold continues to behave as a reliable long-term portfolio anchor, rather than a short-term trade,” Sheth said.\nIndeed, with real yields still muted amid geopolitical uncertainties, gold is likely to stay on an upward path. A softer dollar, rising global debt, and continued central-bank buying should also keep the yellow metal well supported.",

A key gauge of the US currency posted its biggest weekly decline since May, making precious metals cheaper for most buyers. Silver also advanced to a record, having crossed $100 an ounce in the previous session.\nGold’s dramatic rally – the metal has more than doubled over the last two years – drives home bullion’s historic role as a gauge of fear in markets.

Some long-term investors, convinced that inflation will become the only path to state solvency, have piled into gold as a way to preserve purchasing power.\n“People have become a lot more worried about the long-term debt trajectory over the past three years,” said John Reade, chief strategist at the World Gold Council. “The place that I have found the debasement and debt arguments come through the most has been with family offices. They’re thinking about generational wealth protection, rather than the short term.”\nThis debasement trade reached its zenith in late 2025, when prominent investors like Citadel Securities Chief Executive Officer Ken Griffin and Bridgewater Associates Founder Ray Dalio pointed to gold’s rise as a warning signal.\nInvestors are now waiting for Trump’s pick for the next Fed chair after the US president said he has finished interviewing candidates, reiterating that he has someone in mind for the job.

        "full_content": "Silver delivered a strong performance between January 19 and January 22, posting double-digit gains and reaffirming its status as one of the better-performing commodities this cycle. Supported by firm industrial demand, persistent supply constraints, and its dual role as an industrial metal and monetary hedge, the move was fundamentally healthy rather than speculative. While short-term pauses are normal within an ongoing bull phase.\nA large section of investors who chose to participate through silver ETFs ended the period with returns that were materially lower than the performance of silver itself. Some even saw sharp drawdowns toward the end of the week, despite no comparable weakness in the commodity.\nThe First Signal: Price Moves That Didn’t Match the Asset\nThe above table compares daily price changes in MCX Silver with those of five major silver ETFs. The contrast is immediately visible. While MCX Silver posted strong cumulative gains over the period, ETF returns were uneven and, in aggregate, remained in single-digit.\nMore importantly, on the final day of the period (i.e., January 22), silver prices held firm while several ETFs corrected sharply. This is not a comment on volatility alone. It is a reflection of a deeper issue: the gap between asset performance and investor outcome.\nWhere the Gap Emerged: Trading Price vs True Value\nThe second table shows the premium or discount at which silver ETFs traded relative to their Net Asset Value.\nDuring the rally, several ETFs traded consistently at elevated premiums. In simple terms, investors were paying more than the value of the silver held by the fund. This excess did not represent higher silver prices. It represented pressure created by rapid buying and limited liquidity.\nAs buying intensity eased, prices gravitated back toward NAV. That adjustment reduced ETF prices even though silver prices remained resilient. The outcome felt like a loss, but it was not caused by silver. It was caused by how the entry was executed.\nHow Mispricing Turns Into Volatility\nThe third table captures intraday volatility, measured as the high-low range relative to the closing price. Here, the pattern becomes even clearer. Silver ETFs showed significantly wider intraday ranges compared with MCX Silver, particularly on the day premiums reversed. This isn’t accidental. Volatility rises when prices drift from value, even though the underlying asset remains stable.\nWhat This Means for Investors\nFor investors, the lesson is practical rather than theoretical.\n** Always compare the ETF market price with the indicative Net Asset Value (i-NAV) before buying.\n** Avoid entries when premiums stretch meaningfully above fair value.\n** Prefer staggered participation over urgency-driven buying.\nExpense ratios are predictable and gradual. Premiums are immediate and reversible. The difference between the two can decide whether a rally translates into wealth or frustration.\nETFs remain effective instruments when price discovery is orderly. When it is not, outcomes become uneven — even in rising markets. So, participating in a bull market is not only about choosing the right asset. It is also about ensuring that the chosen instrument allows the investor to actually receive the return the asset delivers.\nA Larger Market Consideration\nEpisodes like this highlight a structural gap in market design. When traded prices drift too far from the underlying value, volatility spikes, and outcomes increasingly disadvantage less-informed investors. Markets work best when price and NAV stay closely aligned, keeping volatility contained while allowing rallies to play out smoothly.\nFrom a regulatory standpoint, a few market-friendly measures could meaningfully improve outcomes:\n** Encourage tighter alignment between ETF market prices and i-NAV through clearer premium–discount tolerance bands. A clear realignment of circuit filters of ETFs and its underlying commodity (silver in this case) market should be looked into.\n** Introduce calibrated daily price range limits to prevent sharp, value-detached moves during periods of heavy flows.\n** Strengthen real-time i-NAV visibility to aid better price discovery for retail participants.\nSuch measures would be in line with the motto of the regulator: enhance stability, protect investors' interests, participation, and reinforce confidence without restricting access or innovation.\nClosing Thought\nSilver moved in the right direction this week. The difference lay in how efficiently that reward reached investors. Understanding the difference between market direction and market structure is no longer optional. It is essential. Because in modern markets, returns are earned not only by being right on the asset, but by choosing the right way to own it.\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "Markets were turbulent this week ended January 23, driven by Trump’s Greenland shifts, fears of a transatlantic trade war and renewed US–Iran tensions.\nThe Dollar Index slipped to 97.42, its lowest level since September 2025, amid heightened volatility and shifting geopolitical dynamics. President Trump’s tariff threats against Europe and renewed push to acquire Greenland unsettled investors. Trump warned of “big retaliation” if European countries were to sell US Treasury holdings in response to proposed tariffs targeting NATO partners, amid speculation that Europe could use US assets as leverage.\nMeanwhile, strong US economic data, including an upward revision to Q3 GDP to 4.4%, lower jobless claims, and steady PCE inflation, point to a reduced need for immediate policy easing. Still, US equities closed the choppy week with a second consecutive, albeit modest, weekly loss, as US–EU relations remained strained despite Trump stepping back from immediate tariff action and easing concerns of a US-EU trade war.\nBullion delivered a powerful breakout, with gold and silver posting fresh all-time highs amid surging safe-haven demand. Comex gold jumped over 8% on the week, extending gains for a third straight week to settle near $4,990 per troy ounce, marking its strongest weekly percentage advance since mid-2020, while Silver surged more than 14%, breaking the $100 per ounce level for the first time and settling above $103.\nThe rally was fueled by waning confidence in US assets, renewed trade frictions, a weaker dollar, ongoing geopolitical risks, and sustained central-bank buying. Concerns around US fiscal discipline, Federal Reserve independence, and stress in Japanese government bonds further amplified demand. MCX prices showed even higher volatility ahead of India's February 1 Union Budget.\nGold & Silver Rates Today\nTuesday, 27th January, 2026\nGold Rate in Mumbai Today\nTuesday, 27th January, 2026\nSilver Rate in Mumbai Today\nBase metals posted broadly positive performance, led by nickel, which climbed over 6% on renewed supply uncertainty after Indonesia signaled tighter ore quotas and stricter enforcement against illegal mining. Copper advanced more than 2% to finish above $13,100 per tonne, though prices retreated from intraday highs toward the week’s end. Lead was the sole underperformer, slipping nearly 1%.\nCopper reflected a rebalancing between lingering supply risks and improving near-term availability. Support came from production disruptions at Capstone Copper’s Mantoverde mine in Chile due to a labour strike, partially offset by progress toward restarting Freeport-McMoRan’s Grasberg operations. However, rising Comex inventories above 500,000 tons, global exchange stocks at their highest since 2018, and a deepening LME cash-to-three-month discount signaled easing tightness.\nWTI crude oil ended the week modestly higher, rebounding sharply on Friday to a one-week high of $61.4 per barrel after the US imposed new sanctions on vessels and firms transporting Iranian oil, reviving geopolitical risk. Prices had earlier slipped below $59 per barrel following optimism around potential Ukraine-Russia-US talks, before reversing as Iran-US tensions escalated.\nOn the daily chart, MCX Crude Oil futures saw a strong rally last Friday, closing above the prior swing high of Rs 5,613 per barrel. With the price currently above both the Supertrend (7,3) and the 20 EMA, the trend bias is bullish. Momentum is expected to continue upward next week, facing initial resistance near Rs 5,820, then Rs 5,900. Support on any pullback is positioned at Rs 5,400.\nWith Iran warning that any attack would be treated as “all-out war,” markets remain alert to the risk of disruptions through the Strait of Hormuz, which carries roughly 20% of global crude flows. Looking ahead, steady inflation and resilient consumer spending in the US are likely to keep the Fed on hold in the upcoming meeting, while Trump’s speech, US PPI, and durable goods data will shape policy expectations.",

        "full_content": "Silver crossed the $100 mark for the first time on Comex today (January 23) at 4:25 pm GMT, representing 4.24 percent gain from its previous close. The metal has been on a record spree driven by geopolitical concerns, especially around US-Iran relations, a weaker dollar, and a rise in industrial demand.\nOn MCX, silver domestic futures hit the record peak at Rs 3,41,300 per kilogram on Friday (11:21 am IST), and continued to hover at Rs 3,39,217, up 2.05 percent from the previous close of Rs 3,32,393. The price previously peaked at Rs 3,38,804 on January 22, as recorded on MCX.\nThe Indian Bullion Jewellers Association (IBJA) pegged silver's price at Rs 3,17,705 per kilogram on its 18:30 rate session, which is approximately a 6 percent gain from Rs 2,99,711 in the last 24 hours.\n“Silver touching the $100 per ounce on Comex is a powerful psychological milestone. The surge has been driven by a rare convergence of factors— geopolitical uncertainty, currency debasement, strong industrial demand, and speculative momentum following silver’s breakout to fresh all-time highs,” said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market, an online trading platform.\nWhy is silver up?\nSilver has been on a record spree driven by a historic short squeeze, strong retail participation, and China’s tightening export controls, adding to supply concerns.\nThe metal’s dramatic record surge to the triple digits comes just a day after investors rushed to book profits amid President Trump’s renewed stance on Greenland and withdrew proposed tariffs on European imports.\nMarket sentiment shifted after the US President Donald Trump said a fleet of American warships was heading to the Middle East and that Washington was watching Iran closely. A day before, Trump claimed that a NATO deal would give the US permanent access to Greenland, though specifics are still unclear. Meanwhile, as Trump pulled back from proposed tariffs against the EU countries, the day (January 22) saw a dip in prices.\nMeanwhile, markets look forward to another rate cut by the US Fed in their upcoming policy meeting scheduled on January 27-28.\nShould investors buy, hold, or sell?\nKhoo advises investors not to chase the rally blindly. “Price action at these levels is extremely sensitive. From a tactical perspective, short-term traders may consider booking partial profits or tightening stops, as volatility is likely to spike around the $100 handle.”\nFor long-term investors, silver still makes sense as a strategic hedge against monetary instability and as a beneficiary of structural demand from energy and technology sectors.\n“However, fresh buying is better deferred until a consolidation or pullback toward key support zones, rather than entering at euphoric highs. The bias remains constructive, but disciplined position management is crucial at current levels,” he added.\nThe Augmont Bullion, published on January 23, noted that silver prices have corrected but continue to act as strong support. “As long as silver trades above the $90.5 level (Rs 3,00,000), the metal retains the potential to move higher towards the $99-$100 range (Rs 3,45,000). Overall, dips are likely to attract buying interest rather than signal a trend reversal.”",

        "full_content": "Silver topped $100 an ounce for the first time, extending a scorching rally built on surging demand for haven assets and frenzied buying in retail markets from Shanghai to New York.\nSpot silver surged as much as 4.2% to $100.29 an ounce on Friday, bringing gains this year to almost 40% after prices more than doubled in 2025. Gold also climbed to a fresh record, edging closer to $5,000 an ounce.\nInvestor demand for precious metals intensified during the first year of US President Donald Trump’s second term in the White House, amid growing uncertainties over trade, geopolitics and monetary policy. Worries that silver could be hit with US tariffs triggered a rush to ship metal to New York, culminating with a historic short squeeze in London in October.\nSilver’s advance this week was fueled by a rift in Washington’s relations with European allies, while the latest attempts to reach a deal to end the war in Ukraine have so far failed to reach a breakthrough. Challenges to the Federal Reserve’s independence have also fanned demand.\nMeanwhile, the global silver market has been in a supply deficit for five years. As prices push higher, there’s been a wave of retail buying. And in China, investors have piled into silver as an affordable alternative to gold, while in the US, there’s been a frenzy that’s overwhelmed dealers.\nSome banks had already forecast silver to break into three figures. In a January note, Citigroup Inc. upgraded its near-term outlook for a jump to $100 an ounce, along with a prediction that gold could surge to $5,000 an ounce.\nPrecious metals have also found support after Trump said he had concluded interviews for the next Federal Reserve chair, a move that has revived concerns about the central bank’s independence.\nThe metal’s climb came despite a decision by the US in January to hold off from imposing import tariffs on critical minerals. Trump said he would negotiate bilateral agreements to ensure adequate supplies of the materials, floating price floors, while not ruling out levies.\nIn addition to being a financial asset, silver also has a key industrial role given it’s an efficient conductor of electricity, with the solar industry a major buyer.\nStill, costlier prices have prompted some firms to cut back, with substitution and an anticipated slowdown in global solar installations,set to cut the sector’s silver consumption by about 17% this year, Shanghai Metals Market data show.\nSpot gold traded at $4,961.74 an ounce as of 11:02 a.m. in New York and is on track for an 8% weekly gain, its strongest performance since March 2020. Silver was 3.8% higher at $99.93 an ounce. Platinum also hit a record Friday.",

        "full_content": "Gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) have recorded a significant recovery on January 23 to resume their record rally, after a crash during the previous session. Analysts have suggested which precious metal sees more upside amid this volatility.\nTata Silver ETF, which had crashed up to 24 percent yesterday, hitting a low of Rs 25.56 apiece. The ETF rebounded sharply today, rising more than 17 percent to hit the day’s high at Rs 33 apiece. This marks a 29 percent jump from the low hit by the ETF earlier yesterday.\nGroww Gold ETF is currently the top gainer among all the gold ETFs. The ETFs jumped 7 percent to trade at Rs 155.97 apiece today. The sharp surge in gold and silver ETFs is a clear reflection of how aggressively investors are repositioning toward safe-haven assets amid heightened global uncertainty, said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market.\nShould you buy gold or silver?\nMotilal Oswal Financial Services in its latest note highlighted that silver has delivered an exceptional rally of over 200 percent in the past 12 months, sharply outperforming gold’s 80 percent rise during the same period. This made silver one of the strongest-performing assets globally.\nHowever, the domestic brokerage noted that this sharp outperformance of the white metal has led to a significant compression in the gold–silver ratio, which has fallen from pandemic highs of 127 to around 50 at the beginning of 2026.\n“This reset suggests that while the long-term outlook for precious metals remains constructive, the near-term risk-reward equation may now be shifting in favour of gold after silver’s outsized run,” Motilal said.\n“Silver has delivered sharp outperformance in a short span, and with the gold–silver ratio now near lower levels, the near-term risk-reward is turning more favourable for gold. While we remain positive on both metals and silver continues to have long-term upside backed by industrial demand and tight physical market conditions, the recent rally has also increased near-term volatility. In this phase, a higher allocation to gold can help manage fluctuations while staying invested in precious metals,” said Navneet Damani, Head of Research Commodities and Manav Modi, Commodities Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.\nHowever, the domestic brokerage emphasized that it does not have a negative view on silver. But, it suggests a risk-managed reallocation strategy after an aggressive up move. It added that silver has become more volatile with sharper price swings, while gold continues to offer relatively better stability—making it a preferred near-term hedge in uncertain market conditions.\nDespite the sharp surge in prices, global silver ETFs have seen outflows of over 3 million ounces since the start of 2026, while gold ETFs have witnessed comparatively steadier inflows, reflecting investor preference for more defensive positioning, Motilal added.\nThe brokerage advises investors a 75 percent allocation to gold and 25 percent to silver, indicating a preference for gold as a relatively steadier hedge in the current environment, while still retaining meaningful exposure to silver’s long-term structural upside.\n“Going forward, we believe investors can benefit from a rebalanced precious metals strategy—retaining silver as a long-term structural theme, while increasing gold allocation to manage near-term volatility and capture a potentially stronger risk-adjusted opportunity in the next phase of the cycle,” Damani said.\nLong-term investors may consider staggered allocation within asset allocation limits, while short-term traders should remain cautious amid continued volatility, said Aditya Agrawal, Chief Investment Officer at Avisa Wealth Creators.\nFollow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here.",

Experts have commented on whether the rally in the precious metals will continue, and what lies ahead.\nNotably, today’s sharp recovery in ETFs come as precious metals soared to fresh all-time highs. The ETFs however are still away from their 52-week highs, which they had hit a day before yesterday before taking a breather from the rally.\nTata Silver ETF, which had crashed up to 24 percent yesterday, hitting a low of Rs 25.56 apiece.

The real risk is owning them without clarity on allocation or purpose or without a proper entry-exit plan,” he explained.\nPrecious metals experienced sharp volatility in late December 2025 and early January 2026. Despite price swings, the fundamentals of precious metals are compelling, driven by near-record industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles and AI infrastructure, said Tanvi Kanchan, Associate Director at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers.\n“Given the current geopolitical landscape—from ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine to U.S.-China tensions and uncertainty around trade policies under the new Trump administration—precious metals maintain their relevance as portfolio hedges. However, after such explosive gains in 2025, timing a single-entry point is treacherous,” the analyst said.\nAccording to Kanchan, investors should consider spreading purchases over the coming weeks or months, instead of deploying capital all at once. For conservative investors, allocating 5-10% of portfolios to precious metals ETFs through systematic purchases reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to an asset class that benefits from geopolitical instability and monetary policy uncertainty, she said.\nWhile the momentum remains intact, such elevated levels also increase the risk of short-term volatility and profit-taking, cautioned Khoo. The analyst added that ETF demand still suggests investor conviction in precious metals as a strategic hedge remains robust.\nGold or silver?\nMotilal Oswal believes the gold looks more favourable now, after silver's massive rally. \"Silver has delivered sharp outperformance in a short span, and with the gold–silver ratio now near lower levels, the near-term risk-reward is turning more favourable for gold.

While the ETFs are still away from their recent highs, the precious metals surged to fresh lifetime highs.\nPrecious metals hit fresh all-time highs:\nGold futures with February expiry on MCX hit fresh all time high of Rs 1,59,226 per 10 grams. The contracts with April and June expiries also hit lifetime highs at Rs 1,68,000 per 10 grams and Rs 1,73,676 per 10 grams, respectively.\nSilver futures with March expiry jumped to a fresh all time high of Rs 3,39,927 per kilogram. The contracts with May and July expiries were also at all-time high levels. This comes after the contracts fell around 4 percent yesterday.\nCOMEX silver contract neared $100 per ounce and the gold contract neared $5,000 per ounce, as geopolitical tensions lingered even as US President Donald Trump walked back on his threats of imposing tariffs on European Union nations in his push to acquire Greenland.\nThe commodity prices also rose as the US dollar remained weak. The dollar remained down on Friday, to record its worst week so far in a year, after falling the most in a month in the US trading session. A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities such as gold cheaper for those holding other currencies, aiding demand.\nThe safe-haven demand for both precious metals continued to rise amid uncertainty around the Greenland issue despite Trump's statements about working towards a future deal. Details of the \"framework\" of the deal have been hazy, and European officials on Thursday appeared to be willing to talk about it only in vague terms, Dow Jones reported.\nEuropean Union leaders met for a summit late on Thursday after Trump stepped back from his threat to impose new tariffs over Greenland, Blomberg reported. While Trump's step back has removed the immediate threat to European economic and geopolitical sovereignty, leaders are beginning to sift through the longer-term implications, the report said.\nDuring the summit, European leaders said they wanted an EU-US trade deal to be back on track after the European Parliament suspended its ratification in protest over Trump's threats. However, Trump's threats shook Europe's confidence in its partner, Reuters reported, quoting EU officials and leaders as saying. \"Transatlantic relations have definitely taken a big blow over the last ‌week,\" the report quoted the bloc's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas as saying. While saying ‌they want to work on strengthening transatlantic cooperation, the EU leaders warned that they were ready to act if Trump was to threaten them again, the report said.\nGold ETFs:\nGroww Gold ETF, Invesco India Gold ETF, Motilal Oswal Gold ETF and Axis Gold ETF climbed around 4 percent each, while 360 ONE Gold ETF, Bandhan Gold ETF, Tata Gold ETF, Angel One Gold ETF, Zerodha Gold ETF, Quantum Gold ETF, ICICI Prudential Gold ETF, Edelweiss Gold ETF and Union Gold ETF meanwhile gained more than 3 percent each.\nLIC Mutual Fund Gold ETF, Nippon Gold ETF, Nippon India ETF Gold Bees, HDFC Gold ETF and others meanwhile gained around 3 percent each.\nSilver ETFs:\n360 ONE Silver ETF was the top gainer, jumping more than 10 percent, while Tata Silver ETF, which had crashed up to 24 percent yesterday, jumped 9 percent today. Mirae Asset Silver ETF, Axis Silver ETF, Edelweiss Silver ETF, Aditya Birla Sun Life Silver ETF, DSP Silver ETF, ICICI Prudential Silver ETF and others gained around 9 percent each.\nNippon India Silver ETF, HDFC Silver ETF, Zerodha Silver ETF and others gained more than 8 percent each.\nWhat lies ahead?\nDespite price swings, the fundamentals of the precious metals are compelling, driven by near-record industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles and AI infrastructure, said Tanvi Kanchan, Associate Director, Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers.\n\"Rather than deploying capital all at once, investors should consider spreading purchases over the coming weeks or months. This approach captures the dip while protecting against further corrections that could see silver test,\" the analyst said.\n\"For conservative investors, allocating 5-10% of portfolios to precious metals ETFs through systematic purchases reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to an asset class that benefits from geopolitical instability and monetary policy uncertainty. The structural deficits and industrial demand provide a floor, but expect continued volatility as the market digests 2025's historic run,\" she added.\nThe sharp surge in gold and silver ETFs is a clear reflection of how aggressively investors are repositioning toward safe-haven assets amid heightened global uncertainty, said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market.\n\"Gold prices trading near $4,950–$4,970 per ounce on COMEX, while silver rallies close to $99 per ounce, have pushed both metals firmly into record territory. This strength is being reinforced by a softer US dollar, persistent geopolitical tensions, and growing concerns around currency stability, all of which are driving strong ETF inflows as investors prefer liquid, regulated exposure. The move is equally striking, with gold prices approaching ₹1.6 lakh per 10 grams and silver nearing ₹3.5 lakh per kg, underscoring the global nature of the rally,\" the analyst said.\nWhile the momentum remains intact, such elevated levels also increase the risk of short-term volatility and profit-taking, Khoo said, adding that ETF demand still suggests investor conviction in precious metals as a strategic hedge remains robust.\nFollow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here.",

Silver hit a record high of Rs 3,35,521 on January 21.\nHere is how a kilogram of silver has moved.\nCity-wise silver prices\nSilver rates across India’s major cities showed remarkable uniformity, with only marginal differences due to local taxes, jeweller margins, and logistics costs.\nHow is silver down?\nProfit booking has played its role in the recent decline. Silver’s rapid descent, dropping nearly 8 percent from its record peak, underscores its role as a high-velocity gauge of global risk. The sudden 'Davos De-escalation,' marked by the withdrawal of tariff threats against European allies and a new NATO framework for the Arctic, has punctured the geopolitical bubble that drove the white metal to $95.\n\"The correction may continue as prices are still far from their immediate crucial support of the 20-DEMA level placed at 272,150. Also, Daily SAR is currently placed at 274,300. In the previous bull run, we have observed a decline in OI levels, which signifies a Long unwinding by traders in silver.\n\"Along with that, we have observed an RSI divergence in the daily chart, which is a classic 'Red flag' for building any fresh buying. We can observe an OI decline to 9650 lots so far, which signifies that there is no interest coming up for the long position with perspective to expiry from traders,\" said Aamir Makda, Commodity & Currency Analyst, Choice Broking.\nIs it the right time to buy silver?\n\"In our view, this is not the right time to buy Silver at this moment, as this fall may continue.

As the spectre of a trade war with Europe recedes, we are seeing classic safe-haven liquidation, with investors rotating back into risk assets as the 'Arctic tension' cools,\" said Aamir Makda, Commodity & Currency Analyst, Choice Broking.\nGold prices vary by purity. Check the prices of gold based on its purity:\nCity-wise gold prices in India today\nGold rates across India’s major cities showed remarkable uniformity, with only marginal differences due to local taxes, jeweller margins, and logistics costs.\nOutlook: Will gold continue its momentum?\nJateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst (Commodity and Currency) at LKP Securities, said that focus has shifted to the Fed’s policy at the end of January and the Union Budget on February 1, both of which could influence volatility and currency movement. \"Gold is expected to remain highly volatile in a broad range of Rs 1,45,000–Rs 1,58,000 in the coming week.\"\nCiting OI level, Makda said that there has been a decline in the OI level, currently at 9870 lots, with the price’s upside momentum. \"This signifies a long unwinding by traders and no new additions in long positions.

A key gauge of the US currency’s strength is down 0.8% so far this week. A weaker dollar makes bullion cheaper for most buyers.\nFresh from its best annual performance since 1979, gold has extended a breakneck rally to gain a further 15% in the early weeks of this year. US President Donald Trump’s renewed attacks on the Federal Reserve, as well as geopolitical risk in Venezuela, Iran and Greenland, have added impetus to the so-called debasement trade, whereby investors pull back from sovereign bonds and currencies in favor of alternative havens like gold.\nInvestors are awaiting Trump’s pick for the next Fed chair after the US president said he has finished interviewing candidates, reiterating that he has someone in mind for the job. A more dovish chair would increase bets on further interest-rate cuts this year — a positive for non-yielding bullion — after three successive reductions.\nMeanwhile, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lifted its year-end gold price forecast to $5,400 an ounce from a previous estimate of $4,900, citing intensifying demand from private investors and central banks. Analysts Daan Struyven and Lina Thomas said in a note that risks were “significantly skewed to the upside because private-sector investors may diversify further on lingering global policy uncertainty.”\nGold rose 0.5% to $4,959.39 an ounce as of 8:00 a.m. in Singapore.

        "full_content": "Silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) tumbled up to 24 percent in trade on January 22 amid easing tariff concerns. This came even as the future contracts of the precious metal fell only up to 4 percent on MCX.\nAnalysts have explained why ETFs saw a sharper crash than silver itself, and what investors should do in such times of decline.\nWhy silver ETFs fell more than silver itself?\nTata Silver Exchange Traded Fund saw the most decline on January 22, declining nearly 24 percent to its day's low of Rs 25.56 apiece before recovering some losses.\nSilver futures with March expiry meanwhile dropped 4 percent to its day's low before recovering some losses.\nThe sharper fall in silver ETFs compared to silver futures on MCX is largely a function of how Indian silver had moved into a speculative premium ahead of the Budget, rather than a sudden collapse in underlying global fundamentals, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS.\nHe highlighted how silver on MCX, which represents Indian prices, had outperformed COMEX levels, which represent global prices, over the past two sessions. The analyst explained that this was mainly driven by expectations around an import duty tweak or a policy signal in the Budget.\n\"At its peak, Indian silver was trading near $107 per ounce, almost $13 above the COMEX price of around $94, which is an unusually wide premium by historical standards,\" he said.\nDasani added that the premium that Indian silver prices enjoyed over global prices was not driven by physical tightness alone - it was largely sentiment-led and expectation-driven. \"Once it became clear that no immediate duty relief was forthcoming, that excess premium started unwinding,\" he said.\nExplaining the sharper fall in ETFs, Dasani said that they are priced off domestic spot benchmarks but also reflect investor flows and arbitrage pressures. Hence, they tend to react faster in such \"premium collapse\" phases. \"When retail investors rush to book profits, ETF units face additional selling pressure even if MCX futures are still stabilizing,\" he said.\n\"So what we are seeing is not a bearish signal on silver as an asset class, but a normalization of an India-specific price distortion that had built up ahead of a policy event,\" he added.\nHence, today’s fall shows that the ETF price is getting rationalised and more aligned with the actual market price of the metal. Amar Ranu, Head - Investment Products & Insights, Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers Limited, said, \"Gold and Silver ETFs saw significant drawdowns today...thereby bringing the ETF’s price almost in line with domestic physical and international market prices. (MCX prices of silver have dropped by 3% - 4%in comparison).\"\nWhat should you do?\nDespite price swings, fundamentals are compelling, driven by near-record industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles, and AI infrastructure, said Tanvi Kanchan, Associate Director, Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers.\nThe analyst however cautioned that after the record bull run, timing a single entry point is \"treacherous\". \"Rather than deploying capital all at once, investors should consider spreading purchases over the coming weeks or months. This approach captures the dip while protecting against further corrections that could see silver test,\" she said.\n\"For conservative investors, allocating 5-10% of portfolios to precious metals ETFs through systematic purchases reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to an asset class that benefits from geopolitical instability and monetary policy uncertainty. The structural deficits and industrial demand provide a floor, but expect continued volatility as the market digests 2025's historic run,\" she added.\nTo check if a silver ETF is at premium or discount against MCX prices:\n1. Find daily NAV on AMC site (for example, Nippon India for Silver Bees) or NSE India/Moneycontrol.\n2. Compare to live market price on NSE/BSE.\nIf market price is greater than NAV, then the ETF is trading at a premium to MCX price. If it is lower than NAV, then the ETF is at a discount.\nFair NAV is calculated from MCX silver closing price minus expenses, and is updated daily by AMC.",

As long as silver trades above this zone, the metal retains the potential to move higher towards the $99-$100 range (Rs 3,50,000). Overall, dips are likely to attract buying interest rather than signal a trend reversal.\n\"While near-term profit-taking has capped prices, persistent geopolitical risk and policy unpredictability continue to support the broader bull trend in precious metals,\" Augmont stated in their report.",

This comes as investors may have bought the dip in the precious metals which earlier saw a record rally.\nThe ETFs are however still in deep red amid easing tariff concerns after US President Donald Trump withdrew a threat to impose tariffs on several nations for their stance on Greenland.\nRecovery in silver ETFs:\nTata Silver Exchange Traded Fund, which has earlier crashed 21 percent in the morning, recovered around 10 percent to trade at Rs 28.09 apiece, as seen at 10.30 am.

Motilal Oswal Silver ETF meanwhile gained more than 10 percent from its day’s low.\nGold ETFs also staged a partial recovery, with today’s top loser Birla Sun Life Gold ETF recovering around 6 percent from its day’s low.\nWhy are silver prices falling today?\nTrump said that he had reached the outlines of a deal with NATO on the island's future. \"Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in Davos. He did not give details of the deal.\nAdditionally, he also said that US will not use military force to seize Greenland. \"I won't do that,\" Trump said. \"Okay? Now everyone's saying 'oh, good' that's probably the biggest statement I made because people thought I would use force. I don't have to use force, I don't want to use force, I won't use force,” he added.\nEarlier, gold and silver prices had sharply shot up earlier after Trump threatened to use military force to acquire Greenland, triggering tensions between US and EU nations.

        "full_content": "Even as the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has been setting new records for transaction volume and value every month, with an annual growth rate of around 30 percent, the industry is expecting a higher subsidy for the ecosystem in the 2026 Union Budget.\nThe Payments Council of India and other payment companies have requested a higher subsidy for UPI from the finance ministry this year, according to three separate sources.\nDigital transactions carry what is called a merchant discount rate (MDR), a fee that banks collect from merchants at the point of sale for facilitating digital payments. UPI MDR was 30 basis points before the government waived it in 2020. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.\nTo promote the adoption of digital payments, the government mandated that UPI transactions remain free for users, and in return, it will compensate payment firms for the costs they bear to facilitate them.\n“Since there has been no announcement on MDR since the subsidy allocation, we would like to have a higher subsidy than was announced last year. But we are not sure what the government is planning. But for UPI to reach rural areas and new segments of population, MDR is essential,” said a senior executive with a payments firm that has been part of the process to reach out to the finance ministry\nHowever, last year, the central government announced Rs 1,500 crore as a subsidy for UPI transactions at merchants, as against the industry expectation of around Rs 5,000 crore.\nIn 2024, the government subsidy for UPI was Rs 3,500 crore. As per the government policy, it provides 15 basis points (bps) of subsidy for UPI transactions below Rs 2,000.\nIn 2025, the likely subsidy bill would have been around Rs 6,000 crore, indicating a shortfall of Rs 4,500 crore in FY 2025.\nUPI is the country’s most popular digital payment method, facilitating around 85 percent of all online transactions. The platform run by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) sees over 21.5 billion transactions in a month, worth over Rs 28 lakh crore.\n“The budget is a significant contributor to the continuity of UPI transactions being supported by zero MDR, in particular, for small-value merchant-to-client payments (M2C) for amounts up to Rs 2,000,” said Rohit Mahajan, founder and managing partner of PlutosOne, a technology infrastructure firm that works with payment firms.\nWith UPI becoming the primary option for conducting financial transactions, it is essential for both merchants and the industry to benefit from MDR subsidies, Mahajan said, adding, “For the payment firms to continue to develop in the direction of financial inclusion and support innovation in the next stage of India’s digital finance evolution, this needs to be addressed.”\nPCI, which represents payment and fintech companies, has requested the reintroduction of 30bps or 0.3 percent as MDR on UPI payments for large merchants. Large merchants are those with a turnover of over Rs 40 lakh annually.\nIt also demanded that the government consider MDR for all Rupay Debit card transactions, which aligns with the existing MDR structure for credit cards (around 2 percent) and for non-Rupay debit cards (around 0.75-0.9%).",

On a sequential basis, revenue remainedd flat from Rs 380 crore in the previous quarter.\nLosses were primarily driven by the company’s recently launched 15-minute home services vertical InstaHelp.\nAt a consolidated level, the business reported an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) loss of Rs 17 crore, driven by ongoing investments in InstaHelp, which scaled rapidly during the quarter but incurred an adjusted EBITDA loss of Rs 61 crore.\nExcluding InstaHelp, the core business delivered an Adjusted EBITDA profit of Rs 44 crore. “We expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA losses to persist in the near term as investments in InstaHelp continue, while the core business remains profitable,” the company said.\n\"We expect to reach consolidated Adjusted EBITDA breakeven by Q3 FY28, as profits from our India Consumer Services (Ex InstaHelp) and international markets offset the losses of InstaHelp.

Now we feel more confident about how to handle it,\"he added.\nHe said Zoho believes it is now in a stronger position to both “AI-proof” and “AI-boost” its business, allowing it to resume geographic expansion.\nThe Uttar Pradesh move is expected to follow Zoho’s hub-and-spoke model, similar to its centres in smaller towns such as Tenkasi and Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu.\nSeparately, Vembu said Zoho continues to invest in semiconductor design but has put its semiconductor fabrication plant plans on hold. “We are investing in semiconductor design right now.\nThe fab plan has been paused because we have too many things going on, especially with AI. We will revisit it in a couple of years,” he said.\nHe added that building a chip fabrication unit is a capital- and resource-intensive exercise, and the company wants to prioritise its core software and AI strategy before taking on such a large-scale project.\nZoho’s semiconductor design efforts remain part of its long-term roadmap, but manufacturing will wait until the company has greater clarity and bandwidth.\nThe model was first implemented in Tenkasi in 2011, which later grew into one of Zoho’s most important development centres outside Chennai. Madurai functions as another regional hub within Tamil Nadu.\nBeyond Tamil Nadu, Zoho has expanded this approach to Andhra Pradesh, with Renigunta acting as a key centre, and has also begun building its presence in Uttar Pradesh, where the company has indicated that more focused expansion plans will follow.\nThe company has also set up operations in parts of Kerala, including smaller towns, in line with its decentralisation strategy.\nZoho has consistently said a significant portion of its workforce in such centres is hired locally, supported by internal training programmes such as Zoho Schools of Learning instead of conventional campus recruitment.",

        "full_content": "Former Google and Airbnb executive Peeyush Ranjan, who also served as CTO of Walmart-owned Flipkart, and Mukesh Bansal, co-founder of Myntra, on January 23 launched Fermi.ai, an AI-first edtech startup focused on high-school STEM education in India and the United States.\nThe startup, which has emerged from the Meraki Labs ecosystem, is headquartered in Singapore and operates through subsidiaries in India and the US. Fermi.ai is available free on the cloud, as the company remains in a pilot and product-discovery phase, Ranjan told Moneycontrol.\nThe launch comes at a time when the edtech sector is recalibrating after a funding boom-and-bust cycle, even as generative AI tools such as ChatGPT become deeply embedded in how students study. Ranjan said the company was built to address growing concerns that AI is increasingly being used as a shortcut rather than a learning aid.\n“Students are getting answers faster than ever but their understanding is getting weaker,” Ranjan said. “Learning happens through productive struggle. What we’ve tried to build is an AI tutor that supports that struggle instead of replacing it.”\nDesigned to guide, not give answers\nUnlike most AI-powered learning tools that surface solutions quickly, Fermi.ai is designed to withhold final answers, guiding students through problems step by step instead. The platform uses a stylus-first, canvas-based interface, allowing students to write equations, draw diagrams and work through reasoning in a format closer to pen-and-paper problem solving.\nThe product currently covers maths, physics and chemistry and is built around four core components: an adaptive real-time tutor, a handwriting-first canvas, a curriculum-linked concept graph with an exam-aligned question bank (including AP, IB and JEE), and diagnostic tools that show students and teachers where reasoning breaks down.\nBansal said the platform is meant to surface gaps in thinking rather than mask them. “AI can solve any equation but it can’t yet explain why a student’s logic failed at step three,” he said. “Fermi.ai is meant to show students how they think and give teachers visibility into silent struggles.”\nThe platform uses multiple large language models, including OpenAI and Google models, benchmarking each for different tasks and integrating them into a single system. Ranjan said the company does not train on school-owned data, with teacher-uploaded content remaining with institutions.\nPilot results and measured rollout\nBefore the rollout, Fermi.ai ran a three-month pilot with 79 students, covering more than 15,000 concept tests. According to data shared by the company, students who initially scored two out of ten or lower improved by an average of 4.68 points by their final attempts, while overall mastery scores rose by 2.6 points between early and later practice attempts.\nThe company is running pilots in Bengaluru, north India and Silicon Valley, with discussions underway to expand pilots to additional regions. While the platform is now accessible globally, Ranjan said the company will remain hands-on over the next few months rather than pursue aggressive scale.\n“We want to be sure we’re landing with a great product before we start scaling hard,” he said.\nMonetisation, funding and next steps\nDespite the launch, monetisation has not yet been finalised. Fermi.ai is currently free and pricing discussions are expected once product capabilities and customer segments are clearer. The likely model is per-student, per-seat pricing, with teachers accessing the platform at no cost.\nThe platform is positioned as a supplemental learning tool, acting as a teacher’s assistant in classrooms and as a standalone tutor outside school. It is designed to work on devices with a Chrome browser and stylus support, including Chromebooks and tablets, without requiring dedicated hardware investments.\nFermi.ai is fully funded by Meraki Labs and has not raised external capital. Ranjan said the company is not actively fundraising and will consider raising a dedicated round after finalising the product and pricing strategy.\nThe launch adds to the growing influence of the so-called “Flipkart mafia ”— former Flipkart founders and senior executives who have gone on to build and back startups across sectors. With Fermi.ai, Ranjan and Bansal are extending that operating experience into AI-driven education, even as many founders tread cautiously around mass-market K–12 plays.\nFor now, the founders say the focus is on refining the product and validating the model before scaling, as AI continues to reshape how students learn and how teachers respond.",

The primary capital will be used to fund Juspay’s expansion across international markets and deepen investments in its technology stack, while the secondary component will provide liquidity to early investors and employees holding ESOPs. This marks the second liquidity event facilitated by the company within a year.\nJuspay plans to deploy the funds to expand its footprint across Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, Europe, the UK and North America.\nThe company will also invest in strengthening its payments infrastructure and advancing its artificial intelligence capabilities to improve merchant experience and internal productivity.\n“Our focus over the last decade has been on solving the core complexities of global payments through first-principles engineering and design,” said Sheetal Lalwani, co-founder and chief operating officer of Juspay.\n“This round reflects our growth and provides liquidity opportunities for our early investors and team members who have been part of this journey,\" he added.\nWhy did WestBridge invest in Juspay?\nWestBridge Capital said Juspay’s evolution into a full-stack payments infrastructure provider was a key factor behind the investment.\n“They have moved from payment orchestration to building core payments infrastructure for banks and enterprises, while maintaining a sustainable growth trajectory,” said Deepak Ramineedi, partner at WestBridge Capital.\nWhat does Juspay do?\nFounded in 2012, Juspay provides payment infrastructure to enterprises and banks, enabling them to process large-scale digital transactions reliably.\nIn April 2025, Juspay secured $60 million in a Series D ongoing funding round led by private equity firm Kedaara Capital. The round included a mix of primary and secondary investments, with participation from existing backers SoftBank and Accel.\nThe company processes over 300 million transactions daily and has crossed an annualised total payment volume of $1 trillion. Its customers include companies such as Agoda, Amazon, Flipkart, Google, HSBC, IndiGo, Swiggy, Zepto and Zurich Insurance.\nJuspay said it is focused on building open, interoperable and modular payments infrastructure that can support global commerce at scale. It is also investing in artificial intelligence to improve efficiency across operations and merchant-facing platforms.\nJuspay turned profitable in FY25, reporting a profit of Rs 115 crore before exceptional items and tax. Revenue from operations rose 61 per cent year-on-year to Rs 514 crore, driven by higher digital transaction volumes and operational efficiencies.\nIn FY25, Juspay recorded a Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs 27 crore and a Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs 62 crore. The PAT figure is higher than PBT due to deferred tax adjustments.",

He will be based in the United States and report to Pocket FM co-founder Prateek Dixit.\nSharma previously worked at Meta’s Facebook AI Research (FAIR) unit for nearly three and a half years, where he contributed to several multimodal and large language model projects.\nThis includes the frontier open AI model Llama, as well as Chameleon, MaVIL (Masked Audio-Video Learners), and various next-generation audio-video foundation models. He was with the social networking giant. He also held positions at Citadel and Amazon Lab126.\nWhat will Vasu Sharma's key focus areas be at Pocket FM?\nDixit told Moneycontrol that Sharma's primary focus will be building underlying foundational models and modules to bolster existing products, particularly the AI-powered writing assistant CoPilot.\nSharma will play a crucial role in developing new fiction-writing models, building creator-first AI tools, and scaling high-quality AI-assisted production workflows while maintaining a human-first ethos.\nHe will also look at areas such as multimodal content generation through company initiatives like Blaze, an AI-powered studio that helps creators convert text into comics.\nAdditionally, Sharma will be responsible for hiring and building the company's research and applied AI base to set up a full-fledged presence in the United States, Dixit said.\n\"Pocket FM sits at a rare intersection of AI, creativity and global storytelling. Very few companies in the world have this combination of scale, AI and a mature creator ecosystem,\" Sharma said.\n\"My focus will be to advance the Pocket LLMs and evolve the AI CoPilot into the definitive creative assistant for writers everywhere, helping them ideate richer plots, preserve voice and emotional cadence, and localise stories with cultural precision. Our ultimate objective is to unlock a new generation of IPs, powered by AI and enabled by humans,\" he added.\nRead: Pocket FM now lets Hindi writers in India create AI audio series in a single click\nWhy is Pocket FM building AI models?\nSharma noted that existing foundational AI models are generally English-centric and not designed for story writing.\n\"This needs a fundamental research scope, where we build models from the ground up to suit our use cases. That involves significant core AI research and development: how to train these models, how to get the data, and how to evaluate them. There’s a lot of core foundational work that goes into it,\" he said.\nCurrently, CoPilot and the Pocket LLMs underpin the company's creative workflow, facilitating everything from story ideation and drafting to plot design, collaborating with other writers, editing, emotional toning, and multi-language adaptation with support for over 10 languages.\n\"When we talk to hobby writers, they have great ideas but developing a full-fledged long-form story is always a challenge. That will be the key focus point for us,\" Dixit said.\nGoing forward, the startup plans to develop multimodal capabilities across various formats such as voice, videos, and language.\nWhy are Pocket LLMs needed?\nDixit noted that while AI chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT are effective at writing shorter stories, complexity increases with long-form stories spanning 500-600 hours \"Not just coherency or fluency, even the logical consistency becomes a challenge over time,\" he said.\nIn terms of AI video creation, Sharma said the barrier to video production has lowered significantly, hence the company aims to capture that potential, starting with anime-based videos and eventually moving to full-fledged live-action dramas.\n\"We just want to democratise people's creative thoughts and ideas, and how quickly they can go from a thought to something tangible that they can share with the world,\" he said.\nWhat does Pocket FM do?\nPocket FM is the flagship product of Pocket Entertainment, which also operates the bite-sized online novel app Pocket Novel, the AI-first webcomics platform Pocket Toons, and the micro-drama app Pocket TV.\nThe service offers more than 100,000 audio series, spanning genres such as romance, drama, thriller, fantasy and science fiction, from a community of over 300,000 writers worldwide.\nThe platform claims to have over 250 million listeners who on average spend more than 125 minutes a day.\nStarted by Dixit, Rohan Nayak and Nishanth KS, Pocket Entertainment was last valued at $750 million when it raised $103 million in March 2024.

The company will also invest in technology to improve availability and consistency across channels, while expanding into adjacent travel categories.\n“Once we started hitting meaningful scale, the idea was to start building new territories, new categories and new geographies,” Pathak said. “That was the intent of the fundraise. We’re still a very lean team, so we also wanted to double down on building the organisation the right way.”\nWho backed the round—and what is the funding history?\nThe Series A comes less than a year after Escape Plan raised $5 million in a seed round led by Jungle Ventures with participation from Fireside Ventures in July last year, barely two months after the company began operations.\nBoth Jungle Ventures and Fireside Ventures are existing investors who have doubled down in the Series A, while IndiGo Ventures has come in as a new, strategic investor.\nPathak said the fundraising process was swift. “From the first conversation to money in the bank, it took hardly two to two-and-a-half months,” he said.\nHow big is Escape Plan today?\nFounded by Pathak, who earlier built retail-tech startup Perpule (acquired by Amazon), Escape Plan is positioning itself not as a single-brand luggage player but as a platform-led travel products company, spanning online marketplaces, direct-to-consumer channels and a growing offline retail network.\nThe company is currently operating at a Rs 300 crore-plus annualised revenue run rate, driven largely by luggage sales across channels. Escape Plan operates 25-plus offline stores, serves 6–7 lakh customers, and ships around two lakh pieces of luggage every month, according to the founder.\nWhat is driving revenues, and how is the product mix evolving?\nLuggage remains Escape Plan’s largest revenue contributor, but the company is now expanding into softer travel categories, including travel accessories such as neck pillows and passport covers.\n“Over the next six months, we’ll bring all possible travel categories under Escape Plan,” Pathak said. “Today, we are very luggage-first, but that will change.”\nHow aggressive is the offline expansion plan?\nA significant portion of the Series A capital will be channeled into expanding Escape Plan’s physical retail footprint, with the company targeting 200-plus stores over time.\nThe focus, Pathak said, is on unlocking markets where the company has so far been constrained by price points or limited physical presence.\n“Today, we are restricted to the top 25–30 percent of India by geography,” he said. “The goal is to start playing in 90 percent of India. That means pulling multiple levers—pricing, stores, ecommerce penetration and marketing.”\nWhat does IndiGo Ventures bring to the table?\nIndiGo Ventures’ participation adds a strategic layer to the round, even as the specifics of collaboration are still evolving. IndiGo said Escape Plan’s focus on reliability, scale and customer experience aligns with the rapid expansion of air travel in India.\nWhat are the challenges in scaling travel gear in India?\nDespite its rapid growth, Pathak acknowledged the structural challenges of the travel gear market, which grows largely at inflationary rates and has long been dominated by incumbents.\n“Once you hit Rs 300–500 crore in revenue, you become a meaningful part of the category,” he said. “From there, growth becomes harder, and mistakes become very expensive.”\nBrand or platform—what is Escape Plan really building?\nEscape Plan’s long-term bet is that category-led, platform-style ownership, rather than single-brand D2C plays, will create defensibility in travel gear.\n“Everyone else is building brands. We’re building a platform,” Pathak said. “Like Decathlon for sports or Lenskart for eyewear, we want to solve for every travel need, across price points and geographies.”",

        "full_content": "“A large part of Blinkit’s turnaround in recent months is certainly because of Deepinder’s operating muscle. He’s an execution machine and knows how to get stuff done the right way,” a senior executive who has worked closely with Blinkit chief Albinder Dhindsa told Moneycontrol early last year.\nThe executive paused before adding a caveat that, in many ways, summed up how the industry had long viewed Blinkit’s leadership equation. Dhindsa, he added, was “a solid guy”, but the contrast was hard to ignore. Why hadn’t the same results shown up during the Grofers years? And how had Blinkit suddenly begun firing on all cylinders?\nVersions of that assessment, sometimes kinder and sometimes sharper, have circulated quietly across the startup ecosystem. For years, many industry stakeholders believed that Eternal founder Deepinder Goyal was the brain and the engine, the operator who stepped in when things needed fixing, while Dhindsa played a more muted, secondary role, particularly after Blinkit was acquired by Zomato.\nOn January 21, Eternal’s board decisively upended that long-held perception.\nIn a move that closes one chapter of India’s consumer internet story and opens another, Goyal stepped aside as Group CEO, naming Dhindsa as his successor. For a founder who was asked to step down, twice, in three years, after the Blinkit acquisition, the appointment is less a sudden elevation and more the culmination of a decade-long test of endurance, execution and relevance inside one of India’s most unforgiving businesses.\nA relationship forged long before startups\nThe Dhindsa–Goyal story predates venture capital, valuations and quick commerce.\nAs chronicled in Unseen: The Untold Story of Deepinder Goyal and the Making of Zomato, the two first met as teenagers at a National Talent Search Examination (NTSE) camp in Chandigarh in the late 1990s. Dhindsa, from Patiala, and Goyal, from Muktsar, were among high-performing students suddenly stripped of hometown validation and thrown into a fiercely competitive environment.\nFrom school mates to studying at the prestigious IIT Delhi, the duo had endured one tough lesson: progress would be incremental, and nothing would be guaranteed.\nThat shared grounding - competitive, bruising and formative - shaped a relationship built less on hierarchy and more on mutual testing under pressure, a dynamic that would resurface repeatedly in their professional lives.\nThe familiarity ran deeper than friendship alone. Dhindsa’s wife, Akriti Chopra, was among Zomato’s early co-founders, part of the core team during the company’s formative years. As a result, Dhindsa’s association with Zomato, and with Goyal, was never episodic or transactional, but rooted in shared institutional memory of building the company from scratch.\nThose overlapping personal and professional ties meant that even as Dhindsa went on to chart his own path, the trust between the two founders was tested, strained and recalibrated, but never absent.\nDifferent instincts, early on\nDhindsa’s professional path diverged early from the archetypal consumer-internet founder.\nAfter IIT Delhi, he worked as a transportation analyst at URS Corporation and later as a senior associate at Cambridge Systematics, focusing on infrastructure planning, logistics modelling and network optimisation. He went on to earn an MBA from Columbia Business School, with a brief stint at UBS Investment Bank in New York, as per his LinkedIn profile.\nThe pattern was clear: Dhindsa gravitated toward systems, cost structures and execution, not visibility or evangelism.\nIn December 2011, he joined Zomato as head of international operations, working closely with Goyal during the company’s aggressive global expansion phase. By May 2014, he left to build Grofers.\nGrofers and the long, uneven build\nGrofers was never a linear success story.\nFounded as a hyperlocal delivery platform, it cycled through multiple models — neighbourhood pick-ups, marketplace grocery, inventory-led commerce — often ahead of consumer adoption and ecosystem readiness. For much of its early life, Grofers struggled to find sustained product-market fit and viable unit economics.\nDhindsa raised capital, pivoted repeatedly and stayed largely out of the spotlight. Compared with peers, Grofers often looked perennially stuck.\nThe pandemic, and what followed, changed the trajectory.\nBlinkit, Zomato — and the “Z factor”\nIn 2021, Grofers rebranded as Blinkit and made an aggressive bet on dark stores and ultra-fast delivery. Zomato soon followed with a stake purchase and then a full acquisition.\nAfter Zomato bought a 10 percent stake in Blinkit in March 2022, Deepinder Goyal spent the next several months closely examining the company’s inner workings to assess whether it could realistically be turned around.\n“Only after spending nearly six months diving deep into Blinkit’s operations did he get convinced that the business could be fixed. That’s when Zomato decided to go ahead with the acquisition,” an industry executive had told Moneycontrol earlier.\nFrom being acquired for just $568 million in 2022 to now being worth a significant portion of Eternal’s $30 billion empire, Blinkit, being quick commerce’s market leader, is on a tear.\nExecutives familiar with the process say Goyal’s reputation for fast decision-making and aggressive cost control — already visible in Zomato’s own turnaround and run of profitability — shaped Blinkit’s operating reset. Zomato’s capital, data stack and the backing of Hyperpure, its wholesale arm, strengthened Blinkit’s inventory backbone at a critical juncture.\nThe perception hardened: Blinkit was improving, but many believed Zomato, and Goyal, were the decisive force.\nThe reckoning inside Blinkit\nThat belief was not confined to the outside.\nIn a recent podcast with Raj Shamani, Goyal said he had asked Dhindsa to step down as Blinkit CEO twice after the acquisition. The period, he said, marked “rock bottom”, and he doubted whether Dhindsa could operate within Zomato’s structure at the pace required.\nDhindsa agreed, according to Goyal, but did not leave. Instead, he stayed on and rebuilt.\nThe turnaround that changed the conversation\nOver the next two years, Blinkit’s performance shifted materially.\nThe company tightened dark-store economics, improved inventory predictability, reduced stock-outs and built repeatable city-level density. By 2024, Blinkit had emerged as Eternal’s fastest-growing vertical and a central pillar of its investor narrative.\nThis was not a cosmetic turnaround. It required relentless execution across supply-chain design, operating cadence and cost discipline — areas Dhindsa had spent his career working in.\nIn his letter to shareholders announcing the leadership change, Goyal acknowledged this explicitly. Blinkit’s journey from acquisition to breakeven, he wrote, happened under Dhindsa’s leadership, crediting him with building the team, culture, supply chain and operating rhythm.\n“He has the DNA of a battle-hardened founder and his ability to execute far exceeds mine,” Goyal said.\nBlinkit at the centre of Eternal’s future\nWell before the leadership transition, Goyal had publicly framed Blinkit as central to Eternal’s next phase.\nSpeaking at Startup Mahakumbh in March 2024, he described quick commerce as part of what he called “Zomato version 4”.\n“Blinkit is a part of Zomato version 4, and in one year’s time, Blinkit would be bigger than Zomato. So, I don’t know for how long Zomato will have its relevance,” Goyal said.\nThat prediction came true.\nThe remark also underscored why a leader steeped in execution — not just strategy — would become indispensable to the group’s future.\nA parallel shift in focus\nThe transition also reflects how Goyal’s focus has broadened in recent years.\nEven as he remains vice chairman of Eternal, Goyal has invested $25 million from his personal wealth to Continue, his longevity-focused initiative, invested in and is raising $50 million for Temple, his wearable technology startup, and taken an active role in LAT Aerospace. He has also led or participated in funding rounds in deep-tech and space startups such as Pixxel, Moneycontrol had exclusively reported earlier.\nIn his shareholder letter, Goyal acknowledged that running a public company demands singular focus and risk discipline — constraints that sit uneasily with his appetite for experimentation.\nWhy Dhindsa, despite everything\nEternal today is no longer a single-product company. It is a public-market institution balancing mature cash flows with capital-intensive growth bets. The next phase is less about ideation and more about execution under scrutiny.\nDhindsa’s rise, then, is not accidental.\nHe was underestimated — by the market, by peers, and at one point, by the founder who would later appoint him Group CEO. He ran a company that looked stuck until the ecosystem caught up. He stayed through an acquisition that nearly ended his leadership role.\nAnd then, he showed his execution chops.\nIn stepping into Eternal’s top job in a matter of a few days, Albinder Dhindsa is not replacing Deepinder Goyal so much as completing a cycle that began decades ago in a classroom in Chandigarh — two students navigating failure, pressure and ambition side by side.\nThe industry may still debate who the “brains” are. Eternal’s board has made its call on who runs the machine.",

Albinder Dhindsa (Albi) will be Eternal's new Group CEO,” Goyal said in his letter to shareholders.\nThis decision comes as Goyal explores different ideas. “Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation. These are the kinds of ideas that are better pursued outside a public company like Eternal,” he said in his letter.\n“If these ideas belonged inside Eternal’s strategic scope, I would have pursued them within the company. They do not.”\nMoneycontrol has reported in the past Goyal has been spending more time raising funds for his other ventures. In December, Moneycontrol exclusively reported Goyal is raising $50 million for Temple, his wearables startup, from early investors of Zomato.\nGoyal is also likely to lead a new funding in Pixxel, a space tech company, by investing around $25 million personally, Moneycontrol had exclusively reported earlier this month.\nGoyal also runs Continue, a longevity focused research arm and LAT Aerospace, an aviation company meant for short duration flights.\n\"This transition allows Eternal to remain sharply focused, while giving me the space to explore ideas that do not fit Eternal’s risk profile,\" he told shareholders.\nHis fortunes will however be largely tied to Eternal's financial performance.\n\"My financial future remains meaningfully tied to Eternal, and my incentives remain aligned with long-term shareholder value creation.

This ensures that Eternal continues to have meaningful wealth-creation opportunities for its next generation of leaders, while strengthening long-term retention without incremental shareholder dilution,\" his letter read.\nHe however allayed concerns and said he will continue to oversee operations, this transition is a mere change in title.\n\"The centre of gravity for operating decisions moves to Albi. As Group CEO, he will own day-to-day\nexecution, operating priorities, and business decisions. Blinkit's journey from acquisition to breakeven happened under his leadership. He built the team, the culture, the supply chain, the operating rhythm,\" his letter read.\n\"He has the DNA of a battle-hardened founder and his ability to execute far exceeds mine. He is more than capable of leading Eternal as Group CEO. Blinkit remains our largest growth opportunity and will remain as Albi’s top priority.

        "full_content": "Swiggy-backed ride-hailing unicorn Rapido crossed the Rs 900 crore revenue milestone in FY25 while sharply cutting its losses, signalling improving operating leverage as its mobility and delivery businesses scaled up.\nRoppen Transportation Services, which runs the Rapido platform, reported operating revenue of Rs 934.4 crore for the year ended March 2025, a 44 percent rise from Rs 648.1 crore in FY24. Total income, including other income, stood at Rs 1,002.9 crore, compared with Rs 695.3 crore in the previous year.\nThe company reduced its net loss by about 30 percent to Rs 258.4 crore in FY25 from a loss of Rs 370.7 crore in FY24, even as expenses rose with higher activity levels. Total expenses increased to Rs 1,261.3 crore in FY25 from Rs 1,066 crore a year ago.\nEven though Rapido’s total expenses rose in FY25, its performance improved because revenues grew at a much faster pace, creating operating leverage.\nEmployee benefit expenses climbed to Rs 207 crore from Rs 172.5 crore, reflecting higher headcount and stock-based compensation. Other expenses, which include rider incentives, marketing, platform costs and operational spending, rose to Rs 1,048.7 crore from Rs 887 crore in FY24. Finance costs remained low at Rs 5.6 crore, while depreciation and amortisation stood at Rs 50.5 crore.\nIn FY24, Rapido had posted operating revenue of Rs 648 crore, up nearly 46 percent year-on-year, and had cut its losses to Rs 371 crore from Rs 675 crore in FY23, driven by tighter control over employee and marketing expenses.\nFounded in 2015 by Aravind Sanka, Pavan Guntupalli and Rishikesh SR, the Hyderabad-based company operates across bike taxis, auto-rickshaws, cabs and hyperlocal parcel delivery, and competes with Ola, Uber and Namma Yatri in India’s crowded ride-hailing market.\nRapido entered the unicorn club in July 2024 after raising about $120 million (around Rs 1,000 crore) in a Series E round led by WestBridge Capital. Earlier, it raised $180 million in a Series D round in April 2022 led by Swiggy, with participation from TVS Motor Company, Shell Ventures, Nexus Venture Partners and WestBridge.\nThe stronger financial performance comes as Rapido has launched Ownly, its food delivery app, starting with Bengaluru’s Koramangala, HSR Layout and BTM Layout. The company is making its first large push into a market dominated by Zomato and Swiggy.\nOwnly has been positioned as a zero-commission platform, offering customers meals at offline-equivalent prices while allowing restaurants to avoid high platform fees and hidden charges. The service has started in these three neighbourhoods and will be expanded to other parts of the city in phases.\nRapido plans to fulfil food orders using its existing bike taxi rider network. The company operates in over 500 cities, completes about 4 million rides every month and has nearly 30 million monthly active users. It believes lowering the overall cost of ordering food online will help attract price-sensitive customers who have been impacted by rising platform charges and restaurant mark-ups.\nSeparately, investor activity around the company has also picked up. In November 2025, TVS Motor Company said it had entered into an agreement to sell shares worth Rs 287.93 crore in Rapido to Accel. Moneycontrol had first reported on September 24 that Accel was in talks to invest in Rapido along with Prosus.\nAs part of the transaction, TVS Motor will sell 11,997 Series D compulsorily convertible preference shares (CCPS) to Accel India VIII (Mauritius) for Rs 143.96 crore, and 10 equity shares along with 11,988 Series D CCPS to MIH Investments One BV, an arm of Prosus, for Rs 143.97 crore, according to a stock exchange filing.",

        "full_content": "India continues to stand out as a key growth market, Mahindra Group managing director and chief executive officer Anish Shah told Moneycontrol at the World Economic Forum 2026 in Davos.\n“Perception on India is continuously very positive because India is a bright spot from a growth standpoint,” Shah said, adding the country is likely to remain a major growth destination for companies worldwide.\nShah said global trade conditions will play a critical role in shaping growth opportunities for conglomerates such as Mahindra.\n“Having tariff barriers removed clearly will help and that is something that we are looking for,” he said, referring to ongoing discussions around trade with the US and the European Union. Lower trade friction would support competitiveness and cross-border expansion of Indian manufacturers, he said.\nDespite geopolitical uncertainty, Mahindra continues to see strong traction across its businesses. “Auto as well as other businesses are continuing to see great demand,” Shah said, noting that the group is preparing to add capacity to meet sustained market needs. The outlook remains positive across automotive, farm equipment and other industrial segments, supported by steady domestic consumption.\nOn capital allocation, Shah said Mahindra’s approach is driven by long-term competitiveness rather than trade-offs between businesses. The group continues to back its “growth gems”, a portfolio of high-performing companies that have seen a sharp rise in valuation over recent years. “We continue to invest in our growth gems, and we feel that they have potential to grow even more significantly from here,” he said.\nShah also highlighted the increasing role of artificial intelligence across Mahindra’s operations. While productivity gains dominate global discussions on AI, he said Mahindra is seeing strong impact in quality improvement and plant efficiency. “We see a lot more benefits from quality, from uptime of plants,” he said, adding AI is being deployed across manufacturing processes from paint shops to welding applications, helping improve energy efficiency and operational reliability.\nRecent Union Budgets have laid a strong foundation for long-term growth, Shah said, batting  for continuity. “We have seen some very good budgets over the last few years,” he said, pointing to the focus on capital expenditure, infrastructure creation and fiscal discipline. Continuity in this direction would be supportive for industrial expansion and private investment, he said.\nShah said Mahindra’s ability to navigate volatility comes from decentralised decision-making and strong leadership across businesses, allowing the group to stay resilient and growth-focused even in an uncertain global environment.",

It’s in a very competitive space but we are the market leader there,” Shah said, adding Mahindra holds over 40 percent market share in the segment.\n“That is a business that we feel is almost ready for an IPO. Within the next year it will be and we shall then take it to market then,\" he said, as he also highlighted momentum across Mahindra’s core automotive and industrial businesses.\nHe said demand across the auto and farm equipment segments continues to remain strong. “Auto as well as other businesses are continuing to see great demand, and we are now looking at adding more capacity,” he said.\nShah said Mahindra’s aerostructures business has emerged as a fast-growing vertical. “The business is growing at a very rapid pace,” he said, adding the immediate priority is maintaining quality execution. Mahindra has won $1.2 billion worth of aerostructure orders in the last 12 months and Shah said the focus now is on delivering “a very high level of quality” before pursuing further expansion.\nOn rare earths, Shah said Mahindra’s primary interest is as a consumer rather than a direct investor. The company uses permanent magnets in its motors, especially for electric vehicles.\n“Our play is to offer long-term contracts and commit to paying a slightly higher price to ensure stability of supply,” he said, noting this is critical for building domestic self-sufficiency in the sector.\nMahindra, he said, remains focused on scaling businesses with strong fundamentals and long-term growth visibility.",

He said the India team remains active and will sign more deals this year. “We are excited to see the AI businesses coming out of India, especially AI services businesses which will build on the IT services background that India has…you'll see more out of us in 2026.”\nMore IPOs\nThe Indian startup ecosystem, the third-largest in the world, needs to see more companies going public, more firms being acquired by larger rivals and more share sales by existing shareholders, as per Ganguly.\n“IPOs can only do so much. We need to see more M&As, we need to see more secondaries. The maturing of the Indian venture capital ecosystem will lead to more liquidity coming in,” he said in the interview.\n“However, the ecosystem has made huge strides over the last couple of years, and the domestic IPO market is largely responsible for that.\"\nALSO READ: Davos 2026: AIF structure in India’s GIFT City has been a phenomenal regime for Kedaara, says chief Manish Kejriwal\nA part of the reason why B Capital has stayed away from India is also because some of its portfolio companies did not yield desired results in the recent years.\n“Startups have learnt lessons, but more importantly, we as investors have learnt lessons...the whole investor ecosystem has learnt a lot...and governance is key because governance in India and governance in emerging markets is something that keeps foreign investors away.”",

        "full_content": "Deposit growth is inching up and is in the double digits, but it remains tough, private sector lender Axis Bank CEO Amitabh Chaudhry told Moneycontrol in an interview at the World Economic Forum happening in Davos.\n“It is tough on the ground. You have to fight for the deposits,” he said, adding that the efforts of the Reserve Bank of India and the government are helping to shore up the deposit growth, will help sustain the healthy credit growth.\n“RBI confirming and repeatedly assuring everyone that they will bring about a durable liquidity in the market, and the government hopefully starts funding again, you will see deposit growth inching up slowly from here. It could take some time, but my hope is it has to inch up,” Chaudhry said.\nHowever, he warned that if the deposit growth does not grow as expected, it will have an impact on the credit growth and could ultimately start impacting the economic growth.\nConsolidation and foreign investment\nThe Indian banking sector has attracted interest from overseas financial institutions over the last year and could help in the consolidation of the industry.\n“That also brings stability and kind of a lot of growth capital to some of these banks. The government is also talking about merging some of the larger public sector banks to create the bigger banks,” Chaudhry said.\nImproving asset quality could also facilitate the growth of the industry, and the retail asset quality improves dramatically as banks strengthen their underwriting.\nExpectation from the budget\nChaudhry also expects the union budget to move towards fiscal consolidation even as they spur the capital expenditure cycle.\nSome support needs to be provided to the MSMEs who have lost out in this whole tariff cycle.\n“The fundamental question is what they are doing in pushing Research & Development, pushing startup ventures. Can they do much more than what is being done at this stage? We are definitely falling behind to some extent,” Chaudhry said.\nHe pointed out that India should not fall into the middle-income trap.\n“We need global patents, global brands coming out of India. And at the pace at which it is happening today, I might not be sufficient. So we need to do more,” he added.",

        "full_content": "Bharat Forge chairman and managing director Amit Kalyani said rising tariffs risk making manufacturing uncompetitive and added that India’s upcoming Union Budget must focus on easing pressure on exporters, boosting research and development, and lowering the overall cost of doing business.\n“Increasing tariffs increases the cost base for critical inputs, makes you uncompetitive, leads to inflation, and reduces demand,” Kalyani told Moneycontrol on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. He said the US also faces structural constraints in raw material availability.\n“They do not have aluminum smelters and only do secondary processing. The price differential of steel and aluminum in the US versus the rest of the world is a big dampener on competitiveness,” he said.\nKalyani said while local manufacturing is becoming essential in the US, especially for passenger vehicles under USMCA and ‘Make in the US’ norms, higher input costs could hurt long-term competitiveness in critical sectors such as aerospace and automotive.\nOn Budget expectations, Kalyani said the government must support companies affected by export tariffs and significantly step up incentives for innovation.\n“There should be incentives for research and development because we are far behind China and many other countries,” he said. He also called for a reduction in the cost of doing business. “The cost of energy, manpower, infrastructure, and the quality of infrastructure need to improve substantially,” he added.\nKalyani said India is entering a multi-decade growth phase similar to what China experienced between the mid-1990s and 2020. “India will grow from close to $5 trillion to $20–25 trillion over the next 20 years. That creates huge opportunities,” he said, adding that the absence of mega manufacturing companies presents an opening for firms with technology, capital, and execution capabilities.\nHe said growth at Bharat Forge will come from multiple sectors including automotive, industrials, defence, rail, marine, and emerging areas like unmanned systems.\nOn artificial intelligence, Kalyani said industrial AI will be a major force multiplier. “AI will help India bridge knowledge and time gaps. It will reduce non–value-added work and improve productivity,” he said, adding that AI adoption in Indian companies is already ahead of much of Europe.\n“We are far ahead of Europe in AI adoption, and that creates an opportunity for Indian companies to partner globally and accelerate digital transformation,” he said.",

        "full_content": "Bajaj General Insurance company is addressing 95 percent of customer grievances through generative Artificial Intelligence chatbots, managing director and CEO Tapan Singhel told Moneycontrol on January 20 at the Davos World Economic Forum.\nHe pointed out that the achievement has been complemented by one of the highest Net Promoter Scores (NPS) or customer satisfaction with the company.\n“Insurance has a huge amount of data, and where data is there AI plays a big role. And if I look at the industry, be it underwriting, claims, contact centres, reaching out to consumers, Gen AI is going to play a big role. More than 95% of customer grievances are being handled by bots,” Singhel said.\nHowever, he emphasised the critical need for constant training to counter the tendency of AIs to \"hallucinate.\" \"You have to look at how to constantly improve and integrate it,\" Singhel said, calling the acceleration of AI's pace \"marvellous.\"\nWhile AI can easily manage the most common customer inquiries, such as policy clarification or delays, more complicated cases are still escalated to human agents, who are better equipped to handle them. Additionally, AI is currently assisting the company with basic underwriting and claims redressal.\n\"It has to move to the next level. I predict that in two years, you will see that it gets much, much better than what it is today,\" Singhel said.\nFDI and Market Expansion\nIn a recent development, Bajaj completed the acquisition of its partner Allianz's stake, making it a 100 percent Indian entity. This move follows the central government’s recent amendment to the insurance bill, which aims to enhance Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the sector.\nSinghel welcomed the FDI enhancement, pointing out the capital required for new entrants—a new insurance company needs approximately Rs 1,000 crore. He drew a comparison: while the US has over 6,000 insurance companies, India has only 17.\n\"Let's say 1,000 insurance companies enter India. You are talking about Rs 1,00,000 crores in investment,\" Singhel said. \"An insurance company generates at least 25,000 minimum jobs, so you are talking about a couple of crores of employment generation.\"\nSinghel also highlighted India's low insurance penetration, arguing that increased competition could solve the problem. Around 90 percent of Indian SMEs and MSMEs lack coverage, and a quarter of them go bankrupt following an untoward incident.\nHe suggested the upcoming Union Budget should address this by mandating compulsory insurance for both employees and MSMEs. \"Make it mandatory for all employers to cover all employees. Take care of SME, MSME, take care of sectors where we have an issue in terms of when something goes wrong, and the impact it has on the economy,\" Singhel urged.",

        "full_content": "Primary market issuances have cooled sharply, with January seeing only three initial public offerings so far, as sustained volatility in equity markets has prompted companies to remain on the sidelines.\nAfter a record year in 2025, when companies raised Rs 1.76 trillion through IPOs, fundraising activity in 2026 has remained muted so far. January till date, only three companies have launched public issues this year, collectively raising about Rs 4,765 crore. These include Bharat Coking Coal, Amagi Media Labs and Shadowfax Technologies.\nIndustry experts said while a few IPOs could enter the market in the coming months, many companies are likely to defer listing plans due to continued market uncertainty. Several firms that have already received regulatory approval may delay launches as volatile conditions make pricing difficult. Prolonged delays could also result in the expiry of financial statements included in draft prospectuses, requiring companies to update disclosures with the latest financials and further postponing fundraising plans.\nGaurav Bhandari, Chief Executive Officer of Monarch Networth Capital, said the slowdown in primary market activity is largely due to the meaningful correction witnessed across broader market and mid-cap indices. He said intense selling in these segments has created opportunities at lower valuations, prompting investors to deploy capital toward averaging existing holdings rather than subscribing to new issues, resulting in muted IPO activity.\nDespite the slowdown, the IPO pipeline for 2026 remains strong. More than 200 companies are preparing to tap the markets. Of these, 88 firms have already secured Securities and Exchange Board of India approval to raise over Rs 1 lakh crore, while others are awaiting clearance for an additional Rs 1.5 lakh crore. The pipeline includes several large names such as Hero Fincorp, Reliance Jio, Flipkart, PhonePe, HDFC Securities, OYO, Zepto and Boat.\nExperts said the pace of IPO launches seen over the past two years will depend heavily on overall market conditions and cannot be viewed in isolation. IPO activity is influenced not only by institutional participation but also by sentiment among high-net-worth individuals and retail investors, making secondary market stability a key factor for revival. They added that activity may remain subdued for a few months until broader markets stabilise, unless supported by major policy or budget-related announcements. Predicting an exact recovery timeline remains difficult, as market normalisation depends on multiple domestic and global factors.\nVinit Bolinjkar, Head of Research at Ventura, said progress on trade agreements between India and key global partners, including the United States, along with improved global economic stability, could act as meaningful catalysts for renewed momentum in the primary markets.\nSome experts also noted that the size of the IPO pipeline has contributed to caution, with concerns that multiple large offerings launched simultaneously could strain market liquidity. As a result, issuers are opting to stagger launches rather than rush multiple offerings at the same time. They added that muted post-listing performance of some recently listed companies has further cooled investor sentiment, although this phase does not indicate the end of the IPO cycle.\nUday Patil, Executive Director at PL Capital Markets, said companies had filed IPO documents based on pricing assumptions prevailing under earlier market conditions. With sentiment having changed, issuers may now need to revise valuation expectations. However, regulatory limits on reducing issue sizes have prompted several companies to defer launches instead of cutting prices sharply.\nPatil added that investors have become increasingly selective, preferring offerings at more reasonable valuations. He noted that some recent IPOs have been priced at discounts to earlier private placement valuations, reflecting current market conditions.",

        "full_content": "Swedish telecom gear maker Ericsson is doubling down on India, with CEO Börje Ekholm describing the country a “front-runner” and strategically prioritised market — not just for its scale but for its rapid technology adoption and portfolio relevance.\nIn an interview to Moneycontrol, Ekholm mentioned India’s world-leading data consumption and record-fast 5G rollout and said the surge in data usage will translate into fresh network investments over time, even if near-term spending moderates. He also spoke about India’s three-player market structure after the AGR relief for Vodafone Idea, the company’s India plans and the ongoing restructuring. Edited excerpts of the interview:\nHow do you view the government's move to offer relief to Vodafone Idea on the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) issue? Could it unlock new investments, given Vodafone Idea is a large customer for Ericsson?\nVodafone Idea should comment on its own situation but this development, in a way, solidifies India as a three-player market. That is still a good market structure.\nI am optimistic that, over time, this will lead to innovation on top of a very robust mobile network in India.\nDo you see a better outlook for the Indian telecom industry this year compared to last year?\nYes, I think this year we will see improving conditions in India for us.\nIndia contributes about 5 percent to Ericsson’s revenue. Could this go back to 7 percent as seen in the year-ago quarter?\nI do not want to guide specifically on that. However, you can hear me say that I am very optimistic about the development. We will see where it ends up.\nYou said in the post-earnings call that Ericsson expects to continue to reduce headcount. Will this impact operations in India where you have a large workforce?\nWe try to make ourselves efficient on a global basis. India has a highly skilled workforce and we have a very strong presence there. This allows us to use capabilities in India globally.\nExactly how this will pan out, I cannot say. Any efficiency measures we undertake globally will, of course, be considered across markets but India is a very material and strategic asset for the company.\nAlso, India has a slightly different voluntary attrition pattern compared to other countries, which in a way resolves redundancy situations relatively quickly.\nHow important is India for Ericsson today?\nIndia is today a front-runner market for us. It is a strategically prioritised market. Of course, you can look at it from a size point of view but it is equally important from an adaptability and front-runner portfolio perspective.\nIndia has one of the highest data consumption levels per capita. I believe that comes from the ambition to digitalise India from the government, as well as the strong growth and prospects in the country. When you look at the need in networks, it comes from this expanding consumption. The growth we continue to see will, over time, lead to investment needs. It will fluctuate a bit — up and down quarter over quarter and year over year.\nWe had the fastest 5G build-out ever in India. When that was completed in 2023, it created massive capacity that usage is now growing into. So you may see a slightly slower market in the short term but in the longer term, I am equally optimistic that it will return to a much better investment climate.\nLast year, we discussed Ericsson’s investments in India, including manufacturing and partnerships. Can we expect more announcements this year?\nIt is all linked to business volume, of course. What we have done over the past few years — and what will continue — is that since India is a key market for us where we need a strong presence, we want to be part of the ecosystem in India.\nThat means investing in R&D, manufacturing and overall presence. Exactly when and how future investments will look, we will come back to but our commitment to being a strong partner in India’s digitalisation is very firm.\nAI has been a major theme globally and in telecom. Nvidia recently announced a billion-dollar deal with Nokia for AI RAN and data centre solutions. Is Ericsson pursuing similar collaborations? Could there be strategic changes this year?\nOur strategy has been firm for quite some time. We collaborate with all hardware providers. We believe AI will be critical in RAN, which is why we are part of the AI RAN consortium.\nWe already use AI in our networks — for energy efficiency, spectrum efficiency, and overall network operations. AI is already an integral part of our networks.\nA billion dollars is a significant investment but we spend about $5 billion annually on R&D. Consider the scale. Our strategy is to separate hardware and software, making our solutions hardware-independent.\nThe reason is to give customers flexibility to choose the most competitive hardware layer at any point in time. It could be GPUs or x86 — we do not know yet. We have chosen a slightly different strategic approach.\nGiven the ongoing geopolitical tensions, tariffs and concerns around critical minerals, how is Ericsson navigating supply-chain challenges?\nWe may have taken a slightly different approach than many others. Instead of trying to predict an uncertain world, we focus on being as flexible as possible.\nWe have designed our supply chain to be flexible across different regions, including India. The same applies to R&D. While we cannot predict global developments, we can ensure flexibility to manage different situations. So far, the impact of tariffs on us has been very limited.",

That is still a good market structure. I am optimistic that, over time, this will lead to innovation on top of a very robust mobile network in India,” Ekholm told Moneycontrol in an interview.\nThe government in December froze Vodafone Idea’s adjusted gross revenue dues at Rs 87,695 crore, while approving a staggered repayment plan allowing the debt-laden telco to clear the liabilities between FY32 and FY41.\nSignalling a stronger year ahead, Ekholm said operating conditions in India are set to improve, even as the industry transitions beyond the peak of its record 5G rollout cycle. “I think this year we will see improving conditions in India for us,” he said.\nIndia accounted for 5 percent of Ericsson’s global revenue in the October–December quarter. Asked whether this could scale up to 7 percent, as in 2024, on the back of higher expected capex by telcos, he said, “I am very optimistic about the (AGR) development. We will see where it ends up.”\nIndia a strategic asset\nEricsson is expected to continue with lay-offs as part of its cost-cutting and restructuring effort, having reduced headcount by 5,000 over the past year.

But our commitment to being a strong partner in India’s digitalisation is very firm,” he said.\nEricsson operates major R&D centres in Chennai, Bengaluru and Gurugram across packet core, transport, OSS/BSS, cloud and AI, with around 2,300 professionals in India. Recently, it expanded into ASIC development in Bengaluru, adding over 150 roles and deepening its footprint in the semiconductor ecosystem.\nThe company is also setting up a new RAN Software R&D unit in Bengaluru to develop 5G and 5G Advanced features for its 5G baseband, in close collaboration with global RAN teams.\nIndia is a front-runner market for the Swedish telecom gear maker, he said, adding that it is a strategically prioritised market. “You can look at it from a size point of view, but it is equally important from an adaptability and front-runner portfolio perspective.

        "full_content": "The proposed free trade agreement (FTA) between India and the European Union (EU) may not lead to immediate price reductions for most luxury cars sold in the country, with manufacturers saying the impact on consumer pricing is likely to be limited in the near term. Industry executives and analysts said while certain niche, fully imported models could benefit over time, the bulk of the luxury car market is unlikely to see a material change.\nAfter nearly a decade of negotiations, India and the EU are expected to announce the conclusion of the proposed trade deal on January 27.\nMore than 90 percent of luxury vehicles sold in India — around 51,000–52,000 units annually — are assembled locally. Brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover and Audi operate assembly facilities in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, producing vehicles that often retail above Rs 1 crore. These models are assembled from completely knocked down (CKD) kits imported from overseas manufacturing hubs.\nCKD kits attract an import duty of 15 percent along with a 1.5 percent social welfare surcharge, taking the total to 16.5 percent. In contrast, completely built units (CBUs) face substantially higher duties of 70 percent or 110 percent, depending on vehicle value. Under the proposed FTA, duties on fully imported vehicles could be reduced to around 40 percent initially, with a phased reduction to 10 percent over time.\nGiven that locally assembled luxury vehicles already attract comparatively lower duties, the scope for meaningful reductions in the prices of these models remains limited. Responding to a query from Moneycontrol, Santosh Iyer, managing director and CEO of Mercedes-Benz India, said the agreement was unlikely to materially influence pricing. With over 90 percent of Mercedes-Benz India’s sales coming from locally assembled models and only about 5 percent from EU CBUs, the company does not anticipate any near-term price relief stemming from the FTA, he said.\nFollow our live blog for the latest on India-EU FTA\nMercedes-Benz assembles its vehicles at its Chakan plant near Pune, importing kits primarily from Germany. The company recently began local production of the Mercedes-Maybach GLS — its first such move outside the US — which resulted in a price reduction of about Rs 42 lakh, or roughly 13 percent, compared to the imported version, underscoring the impact of localisation rather than trade concessions.\nBMW, the country’s second-largest luxury carmaker, follows a similar approach, with nearly nine of ten models assembled locally. While the company does not expect immediate price changes to its current lineup, it views the proposed FTA as a longer-term opportunity. BMW Group India president and CEO Hardeep Singh Brar said lower duties on CBUs could help broaden the brand’s portfolio by enabling the introduction of globally popular models and allowing manufacturers to test demand before committing to deeper localisation.\nAlso read: FTA with EU could give an initial $5 billion boost to Indian exports\nJaguar Land Rover also signalled that trade agreements are unlikely to translate into immediate price changes for its India-assembled models. The company assembles several Range Rover and Discovery models at its Pune facility, with a larger plant near Chennai expected to get operational soon. Even as the proposed Indo-UK FTA awaits implementation, the company has indicated that customers should not expect near-term pricing benefits.\nIndustry observers said the biggest beneficiaries of lower import duties could be niche supercar manufacturers such as Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini and Porsche, all of which import fully built vehicles into India. Similarly, UK-manufactured ultra-luxury brands such as Rolls-Royce and Bentley could see some benefit under a future Indo-UK trade agreement.\nThat said, analysts caution that currency movements may offset a significant portion of any duty-related gains. Luxury carmakers implemented multiple price hikes in 2025 and again in early 2026, largely due to exchange-rate pressures. “The rupee depreciated by nearly 19 percent against the euro in 2025 alone, which could dilute much of the benefit from lower import duties on fully built cars in the next couple of years,” a market expert said.\nWhile trade agreements may gradually reshape the structure of luxury car imports into India, meaningful price relief for most premium car buyers is likely to remain a longer-term prospect rather than an immediate outcome.",

        "full_content": "On January 17, India’s civil aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), made public the findings of a four-member inquiry committee constituted to investigate the unprecedented operational disruption faced by IndiGo in early December.\nThe committee’s conclusions were unequivocal. The crisis, it said, was not triggered by a single event, but by a combination of over-optimisation of operations, inadequate regulatory preparedness, deficiencies in system software support, and, most critically, shortcomings in IndiGo’s management structure and operational control.\nAt the heart of these findings was IndiGo’s Operations Control Centre (OCC), a function widely regarded as the nerve centre of any airline. The DGCA’s subsequent regulatory action squarely focused on the OCC and its leadership—specifically Jason Herter, Senior Vice President in charge of the OCC.\n'Unprecedented operational breakdown'\nBetween December 3 and December 5, IndiGo cancelled more than 2,500 flights and delayed over 1,850, leaving upwards of 300,000 passengers stranded across airports in the country. The scale of the disruption also triggered a cascading impact on the operations of other airlines, placing stress on airport infrastructure, ground handling resources and air traffic management systems.\nIn response, the DGCA constituted the inquiry committee on December 6 to undertake a review the circumstances that led to what it said was an unprecedented operational breakdown.\nAccording to the committee report, IndiGo’s management failed to adequately identify planning deficiencies, maintain sufficient operational buffers and effectively implement the revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) provisions. These failures, the report said, directly resulted in widespread delays and large-scale cancellations.\nThe inquiry also highlighted an overriding focus on maximising utilisation of crew, aircraft and network resources. Crew rosters were designed to stretch duty periods to their limits, with increased dependence on dead-heading, tail swaps, extended duty patterns and minimal recovery margins. While such measures can improve efficiency under stable conditions, the committee noted that they significantly reduced roster buffers and compromised operational resilience when disruptions occurred. In effect, IndiGo’s operating model left little room for error.\nFollowing the inquiry, the DGCA ordered IndiGo to reduce its daily flight operations by 10 percent — amounting to a cut of just over 200 flights from its usual schedule of 2,050–2,100 services a day. The regulator also directed the airline to compensate affected passengers as per applicable regulations and imposed a financial penalty of Rs 22.2 crore.\nLeadership under fire\nHowever, the most stringent action was taken against IndiGo’s top operational leadership. The DGCA ordered the removal of Jason Herter, senior vice president (Operations Control Centre), from current operational responsibilities and barred him from holding any accountable position. The regulator cited failures in systemic planning and the timely implementation of revised FDTL provisions.\nThe OCC is often described as an airline’s nerve centre. It exercises operational control over flights and is responsible for the real-time coordination of aircraft, crew, flight dispatch and network decisions. The OCC continuously monitors weather patterns, airspace restrictions, aircraft technical status, crew duty limitations and airport conditions.\nWhen disruptions arise—whether due to bad weather, technical snags, airspace closures or crew shortages—the OCC decides whether flights should operate, be delayed, diverted or cancelled. It also oversees route planning, fuel requirements, alternate airports and compliance with regulatory limits.\nCrucially, the OCC ensures that flight crews are properly qualified, legally rested and available at the right place and time. Any misjudgement in this complex balancing act can rapidly snowball into widespread disruption, particularly for a high-frequency, tightly scheduled airline such as IndiGo.\nHerter has served as IndiGo’s Senior Vice President (OCC) since July 2023 and is among the airline’s senior leadership. A former Group Head of the Network Management Centre at AirAsia, he was set to complete a decade with IndiGo in September 2026.\nHis responsibilities include oversight of the OCC, crew resources and operations management systems. This spans crew manpower planning, roster and training planning, crew scheduling, network management and flight dispatch—functions that sit at the core of day-to-day airline operations.\nMore than a week after the DGCA order was issued, IndiGo is yet to formally comply with the directive to remove Herter from operational responsibilities. Responding to queries, IndiGo chief executive officer Pieter Elbers said the airline had received the order and was evaluating it.\n“The board and the management of IndiGo are committed to take full cognizance of these orders and will in a timely manner take the appropriate measures,” Elbers said.\nHe added that an in-depth review of the robustness of IndiGo’s internal processes is underway and that the airline is engaging with the regulator. A key focus, he said, is ensuring continuity and stability of operations as the revised FDTL norms are lifted on February 11.\nThe December disruption has underscored a fundamental truth of airline operations: efficiency without adequate buffers can quickly turn into fragility. For an airline of IndiGo’s scale, the OCC is not merely a back-office function, but the command centre that safeguards safety, compliance and operational continuity.\nAs the DGCA’s findings suggest, failures at the OCC level can have consequences that extend far beyond a single airline—affecting passengers, airports and the wider aviation ecosystem.",

It is the second generation of an AI chip called Maia that Microsoft introduced in 2023.\nThe Maia 200 comes as major cloud computing firms such as Microsoft, Alphabet's Google and Amazon.com's Amazon Web Services - some of Nvidia's biggest customers - are producing their own chips that increasingly compete with Nvidia.\nGoogle, in particular, has garnered interest from major Nvidia customers such as Meta Platforms, which is working closely with Google to close one of the biggest software gaps between Google and Nvidia's AI chip offerings.\nFor its part, Microsoft said that along with the new Maia chip, it will be offering a package of software tools to program it. That includes Triton, an open-source software tool with major contributions from ChatGPT creator OpenAI that takes on the same tasks as Cuda, the Nvidia software that many Wall Street analysts say is Nvidia's biggest competitive advantage.\nLike Nvidia's forthcoming flagship \"Vera Rubin\" chips introduced earlier this month, Microsoft's Maia 200 is made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co using 3-nanometer chipmaking technology and will use high-bandwidth memory chips, albeit an older and slower generation than Nvidia's forthcoming chips.\nBut Microsoft has also taken a page from the playbook of some of Nvidia's rising competitors by packing the Maia 200 chip with a significant amount of what is known as SRAM, a type of memory that can provide speed advantages for chatbots and other AI systems when they field requests from a large number of users.\nCerebras Systems, which recently inked a $10 billion deal with OpenAI to supply computing power, leans heavily on that technology, as does Groq, the startup that Nvidia licensed technology from in a reported $20 billion deal.",

        "full_content": "PVR INOX’s decision to exit gourmet popcorn brand 4700BC will not dent its food and beverage business, and will, in fact, improve its earnings profile, the multiplex chain said on Monday.\nThe company announced on January 26 that it has divested its stake in Zea Maize, the owner of 4700BC, selling the brand to FMCG major Marico for Rs 226.8 crore. PVR INOX had acquired a 70 percent stake in the company in 2015 for around Rs 5 crore.\nPopcorn and profit\n“The sale of 4700BC will have no impact on our food and beverage revenue. When we sell this business, it removes a loss-making subsidiary and is therefore accretive to our earnings,” said Gaurav Sharma, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of PVR INOX told Moneycontrol. “It also presented a timely monetisation opportunity for a non-core asset to unlock shareholder value.”\nSharma said the popcorn brand contributed about Rs 100 crore in annual revenue, accounting for less than one percent of PVR INOX’s total F&B sales. In contrast, 4700BC reported an EBITDA loss of nearly Rs 14 crore in FY25 and a total loss of about Rs 16 crore.\nAlso read: Inside PVR Inox’s popcorn strategy: Driving F&B spends amid weak box office in FY25\n“The big benefit is that this business was loss-making. By exiting, we remove that drag on earnings,” he said, adding that the divestment will have “zero impact” on PVR INOX’s in-cinema and home delivery operations.\nMoviegoers will continue to see 4700BC popcorn at PVR INOX theatres, as the brand will remain available as a third-party offering.\nIn terms of returns, Sharma said the company had invested a total of Rs 94.6 crore as equity in 4700BC over time, with the bulk of the capital infused post-Covid as the brand expanded onto quick-commerce platforms.\n“This transaction delivers a very healthy return. We will receive Rs 226.8 crore in cash, translating into an internal rate of return of around 24.5 percent on our total equity investment,” he said.\nThe immediate cash infusion of Rs 227 crore used to deleverage reduces net debt by around 25 percent, accelerating the goal of near-zero debt by FY27, noted Karan Taurani, Executive Vice President at Elara Capital.\nThe company will be able to save Rs 18-20 crore in annual interest cost, as it currently has a net debt of Rs 600 crore.\nAlso read: PVR INOX exits gourmet popcorn brand 4700BC for Rs 226.8 crore, stake sold to Marico\nUse of funds\nThe proceeds will be deployed across three priority areas: reducing debt, strengthening the balance sheet, and funding the core cinema business.\n“We have been pivoting towards a more asset-light model with more franchise-led expansion. But there are still large opportunities in markets where multiplex penetration is low,” Sharma said. “So, the use of proceeds will be a combination of deleveraging and funding growth.”\nOn the F&B front, PVR INOX plans to continue building its in-house brands. The company currently has around 10 food and beverage brands, including Dogfather, its hotdog concept.\n“Our focus is on building brands in fast-growing categories where there are no strong players today,” Sharma said. “4700BC is more of an FMCG and QSR-style business.”\nHe added that 4700BC has built a strong multi-channel presence across digital commerce, modern retail and institutional channels, but its next phase of growth requires deeper FMCG capabilities.\n“We realised that at this stage, the brand is better supported by a larger FMCG platform like Marico, which brings wider distribution, faster product expansion and more capital,” Sharma said.",

        "full_content": "As India looks to sustain deal momentum amid global uncertainty, tax clarity has become as critical as tax rates. For the M&A ecosystem, Budget 2026 comes at a time when deal structuring is increasingly shaped by tax certainty, dispute risk and execution timelines. The Budget therefore presents an opportunity to address issues that continue to influence deal activity.\nClarity after the Tiger Global judgement\nAs the taxpayers and advisors prepare for the landscape post the Supreme Court’s Tiger Global judgement, it is critical that the government provides clarity particularly on the fate of past cases and concluded transactions. Guidance on the applicability of the General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR), especially for investments made before 1 April 2017 which were grandfathered, would help reduce uncertainty and potential litigation.\nTax neutrality for fast-track demergers\nSection 233 of the Companies Act was introduced to expedite demergers and to make intra-group and smaller restructurings faster. Such demergers though fast tracked still require filings with the regulator and compliances to be undertaken. As per the government, fast track demergers are not tax neutral since they are not court-monitored and thus could potentially result in tax avoidance. In the absence of tax neutrality of demergers, the fast-track option becomes commercially meaningless. Apprehensions of the revenue could be addressed through clear valuation norms, further, GAAR could help address any avoidance arrangements. That would align tax policy with the stated ease-of-doing-business intent.\nService sector mergers\nGiven the increased prominence of the service sector in India growth story, it would be pertinent to extend the benefit of carry forward of losses in the case of mergers of service sectors and should not be restricted to manufacturing/hotels/industrial undertakings.\nTax certainty for global capability centres (GCC) in India - supporting a strategic growth engine\nGCCs in India have been rapidly growing with many multinationals setting their GCCs in India due to availability of skilled labour at reduced costs, ease of language, political stability and business friendly environment. With the growth of GCCs, host of tax aspects become relevant including permanent establishment (PE) concerns. It would be helpful if the government comes out with some safe harbours from PE rigours especially on cross-border secondments and remuneration for the GCCs including introduction of concessional tax regimes for GGCs, data centres, etc.\nTax neutrality for cross-border mergers and restructurings\nIndian businesses are increasingly global in their footprint and investor base. Yet outbound mergers, where an Indian company merges into an overseas company, often face immediate tax implications even when there is no monetisation. One of the long-standing demands of the tax community has been for the government to provide neutrality on outbound mergers or business combinations. While there are provisions providing exemption to inbound mergers, lack of clarity on outbound mergers has often caused hinderances in Indian companies going global.\nAlso, in the case of foreign mergers, particularly with wholly owned subsidiaries, tax neutrality is uncertain since the condition of issuing shares to oneself, required for tax neutrality, is practically impossible to fulfil. This condition is already relaxed in the case of domestic mergers. A similar relaxation should be extended to foreign mergers, along with a shareholder-level exemption where such mergers indirectly result in the transfer of Indian share.\nOther clarifications\nTaxpayers would also expect clarifications on safe harbours for buying out listed companies through the off-market process from the trigger of Section 56(2)(x) of the Income-tax Act, 1961, since at occasions, it can be difficult to match the market price, especially where there is gap between signing and closing of the transaction. In addition, rationalising the holding period for slump sales, currently set at 36 months, as against 12 or 24 months for most of the asset classes, could be a welcome step. Further, clarity on the timing of taxation of contingent consideration, by taxing such amounts as capital gains only upon actual crystallisation rather than upfront at closing, would better align taxation with the commercial realities of milestone-based M&A transactions.\nWith Budget 2026 around the corner, targeted interventions in these areas could go a long way in improving business sentiment, reducing disputes and enabling deal activity that supports economic growth.\n(Vinita Krishnan is Executive Director and Bharat Jain, Principal Associate at Khaitan & Co.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

The premium snacking category is expected to grow at 20 percent CAGR, reaching Rs 24,000 crore by FY30. 4700BC aims to have a significant share in this space while diversifying into more snacking categories.\nPVR Inox invested Rs 44.7 crore in Zea Maize in FY25 to increase production capacity for existing products, increase presence across retail outlets, hire senior talent across leadership roles in sales, operations and marketing.\n“We recognised the potential in 4700BC at a very early stage and supported the brand through its formative years. From a niche gourmet popcorn offering, it has grown into a nationally recognised premium snacking brand. As it looks to scale further and broaden its ambition, the brand is well positioned under the stewardship of a scaled FMCG leader like Marico. For PVR INOX, this transaction represents a natural culmination of our strategic role and enables us to monetise a non-core asset,” said Ajay Bijli, Managing Director, PVR INOX.\nSaugata Gupta, MD and CEO, Marico Limited said, “The investment in 4700BC aligns well with Marico’s ambition to participate in fast-growing food categories through distinctive, future-ready brands. We see immense potential in 4700BC as a premium snacking brand with deep consumer connect and proven execution. Together, we will tap the opportunity to leverage our existing scale in foods to broaden the brand’s presence across channels, while staying true to its consumer-first ethos and harnessing its top-notch innovation capabilities.”",

The agreement is expected to pave the way for setting up a Final Assembly Line (FAL) in India for Embraer’s civilian aircraft, sources said.\nEmbraer manufactures commercial jets with seating capacity of up to 150 passengers. The proposed FAL will mark Adani Group’s entry into aircraft manufacturing, expanding its footprint in India’s rapidly growing aviation ecosystem.\nOne of the sources said that, over time, Adani Group is also likely to begin manufacturing aircraft components once the assembly line becomes operational.\nIn a joint media invitation issued by the two companies for a briefing in the national capital on January 27, they said that “a historic development in India's commercial aviation ‘Make in India’ journey will be announced.”\nEmbraer has been stepping up its focus on the Indian market to tap into long-term growth opportunities. In October 2025, the Brazilian aircraft maker opened a new office in New Delhi.\nThe proposed venture with Adani Group is expected to give Embraer a significant boost in India’s civil aviation space, where it aims to offer cost-competitive regional jets.\nEmbraer’s E-Jets began operating in India in 2005, and the company currently has nearly 50 aircraft in the country. These serve the Indian Air Force, government agencies, business jet operators and regional airline Star Air.\nAccording to Embraer, the Indian aviation market is expected to require at least 500 aircraft in the 80–146 seat segment over the next 20 years. The company highlighted this projection in a release issued on January 21.\nIn the defence segment, Embraer Defense & Security had, in 2024, signed an MoU with Mahindra Defence Systems to explore a joint bid for the Indian Air Force’s Medium Transport Aircraft (MTA) programme using the C-390 Millennium platform.\nEmbraer is also looking to strengthen its presence across multiple aviation segments in India, including commercial aviation, defence, business jets, services and support, as well as urban air mobility.\nMeanwhile, the government is working on measures to boost civilian aerospace manufacturing and maintenance activities in the country. In November 2025, French aerospace major Safran announced that its maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility for LEAP engines in India would become operational this year.",

What we are seeing is customers, against that uncertainty, make decisions which prompt an investment, and that's what we're looking to. That's what we are intersecting with, and that's what's inspiring the confidence that we've got about Q4 and the next fiscal year.\" He was responding to a query on the growth outlook in the midst of tariff wars and geopolitical uncertainty.\nFor FY26, he said,\"We will look to drive sequential double-digit growth (from) Q3 to Q4 and then we expect double digit growth organically next year.\" In the third quarter ended December 31, 2025 the company had posted a consolidated revenue from operations at Rs 1,365.73 crore as against Rs 1,317.38 crore in the year-ago period.\nReferring to the company's 75 million euros (over Rs 775 crore) acquisition of Germany-based ES-Tech GmbH and its subsidiaries last year, Harris said,\"…that will represent about USD 40 million of additional business for us and we expect that business to grow…In addition to the organic double-digit growth, that business will be included in our numbers.\"\nNoting that the company expects volume to translate into significant margin improvement, he said,\"We are looking at a very good year next year, both top line and and bottom line.\" When asked about possible hiring to meet growth expectations, Harris said.\n\"As we move into the year (next fiscal), we don't need any more resources, but as we move through the year and as the anticipated growth continues, then we will need to start to add headcount.\"\nDespite the company investing very heavily in AI, he said,\"We do not need to do any retrenchments in a material way, and we will drive incremental growth next year but it will be in a way that will complement the investments we are making in AI and digital.\" The company has been investing very heavily and reskilling its teams to ensure that the capability matches the demand in the market, Harris said, adding \"we have been relatively lean in terms of things like overhead and bench\".\nOn the expectations from the upcoming Union Budget, he said the government has been very supportive of the manufacturing sector and specifically the automotive industry and the company would like to see the government continue the support they provided for those sectors.\n\"It is really accelerating, not just the size of the manufacturing sector, and specifically the automotive sector, but also the maturity of the industries here in India,\" Harris noted.",

That’s a 21% increase from his 2024 pay, when he was awarded a $39 million package, as well as a major multiyear retention bonus.\nThe figure came in higher than the $43 million awarded to JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon for 2025. Both executives were paid the same for 2024.\nUnder Solomon’s leadership last year, Goldman posted record revenue in its banking and markets division and record management fees in its asset-management business.\nAided by a growing US economy and lighter regulatory environment, its shares rose by nearly 54% last year, ahead of rivals Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, though behind Citigroup Inc.\nSolomon’s pay package follows the announcement last year of a pair of $80 million retention awards to the CEO and John Waldron, the firm’s president. Those bonuses, which were approved by a shareholder vote in April despite controversy over their size and structure, will vest in January 2030 and were widely seen as a move to keep Waldron at the firm to be Solomon’s eventual successor.\nWith Goldman’s share surge, the awards have already risen in value by about 50% since their grant date in January last year.\nAlong with those grants, the firm launched a program to give some of its top leaders a slice of carried interest earned on its private-markets funds run in the asset-management business.",

Planemakers have until now pushed back, arguing in part that the business case did not add up.\nAdani Aerospace has signed a memorandum of understanding with Embraer, the world's third-largest planemaker behind Airbus and Boeing, to set up a final assembly line for its regional jets in India, the source said.\nAdani Aerospace and Embraer sent invitations to the media teasing a \"historic\" development in commercial aviation on Tuesday. The announcement will be made at the office of India's civil aviation ministry, the invitation said.\nEmbraer declined to comment, while Adani Aerospace and India's civil aviation ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The pact was earlier reported by The Times of India newspaper.\nNearly 50 Embraer aircraft of various types operate in India, including civil aircraft flown by regional carrier Star Air. The fleet is much smaller than the Airbus and Boeing aircraft that dominate Indian airlines' order books.\nEmbraer, which opened an office in New Delhi last year, has forecast that the South Asian nation will need at least 500 aircraft in the 80- to 146-seat range over the next 20 years.",

India, the SEC said, has previously refused two requests to serve the summons, the report said.\nAdani Power’s domestic bond offering is part of the Adani group’s plans to diversify its funding sources by tap domestic debt markets and reducing its dependence on banks and offshore debt markets.\nEarlier this month, the group’s flagship entity Adani Enterprises Ltd’s Rs 1,000-crore public NCD offering, launched on January 6, was fully subscribed in the first hour of the launch.\nAdani group companies have raised around Rs 15,000 crore from domestic bond offerings in the last one and half years, with close to Rs 3,000 crore raised from retail investors, driven by rising appetite for debt alternatives as equity markets have seen prolonged bouts of volatility amid global geo-political tensions and trade headwinds.",

        "full_content": "Tata Motors managing director and CEO Girish Wagh has said the strong uptick in demand for trucks and buses has prompted a strategic revaluation of the company’s manufacturing capacity.\nIn an interview to Moneycontrol, he said the company is looking at squeezing out incremental volumes from its existing plants through process optimisation and “de-bottlenecking” to keep up with robust demand. Edited excerpts of the interview:\nOn January 20 you launched a large set of new products in one go. What segment will they cater to?\nWe launched 17 vehicles in three-four themes. Never have we done this kind of a wide launch before. In the multi-axle segment, we have four tonnage points; 28, 35, 42 and 48 tonne. We have studied the regulations and the kind of maximum loads is allowed per axle, and the how much the road can bear and based on the allowed framework, they have redesigned the suspension of a tandem axle.\nWhat is a tandem axle?\nA tandem axle is a combination of two axles in the rear, which distributes the load between the two more evenly and therefore, stay within the road limit. Therefore, there is an increase in the payload by around 1.8 tonne. Likewise, a 28 tonne vehicle will become a 30 tonne vehicle and so on.\nHow were they different previously?\nNot more than six years back, they increased the axle load regulation, where the maximum GVW (gross vehicle weight) of a 5-axle truck used to be 37 tonne and 3718 was the highest selling vehicle. Through this innovation, a four-axle truck will have 37 tonne capacity.\nWhat are the other launches you have planned?\nIn ILMCV (intermediate, light and medium) segment, we are launching the Azura brand. We are also launching a range of electric trucks in the 9, 12, 19 28, 55 tonne configuration. These trucks will come with our new intelligent, modular, EV architecture, which consists of modular battery packs and in-house battery management system and in-house developed e-axles.\nHow much has Tata Motors invested in the development of these new products?\nWe have been saying that we will stay within 2-4 percent of the revenue as the capex. More than half of this is R&D. A good part of the capex has been routed towards electrification, connectivity and autonomous. Its not just the vehicle architecture that has been improved, it’s the powertrain too which can take us right up to 2040 and the new-gen battery electric architecture which can also take us beyond that.\nWith these new launches and demand uptick, are you looking at capacity creation?\nWe are not looking at greenfield expansion because we have sufficient space among all our plant. But with some of the migrations that has happened within a segment to a different model, there are specific areas where we are revisiting our capacity and capex requirement. During this year, we have increased the capacity of bus-body building. We are doing it in a selective manner and this is going to be a de-bottlenecking exercise rather than full-fledged capacity greenfield creation.\nWhat is the capacity utilisation rate?\nOur Jamshedpur and Lucknow plants' capacity utilisation are upwards of 80-85 percent. Depending on the vehicle, our Pantnagar plant will be around 50-60 percent. At Dharwad, again depending on the vehicle, could be operating at 60-70 percent utilisation and Pune could be at 60-85 percent.\nWhat has been the jump due to the GST cut?\nGoing by the Vahan data, Q3 over Q2 (FY26) ,the industry has grown by 25.8 percent and our volumes grew by 29.4 percent. Post-GST there are certainly some segments that have started to do well. Car carriers and e-commerce have been doing very well. Steel, cement have done well. Tipper and mining trucks have gone up well. ILCV and heavy have seen very good growth.",

        "full_content": "Sun Pharma on Thursday said it has received approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to manufacture and market a generic version of semaglutide injection for chronic weight management in adults.\nThe drug will be launched under the brand name Noveltreat after the expiry of the semaglutide patent in India, the company said in a press statement to exchanges, signalling the entry of a domestic player into a category currently dominated by high-priced innovator products.\nSemaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist used for weight management alongside a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. Sun Pharma said the approval followed a Phase III clinical trial conducted in India, addressing a key regulatory requirement for local evidence.\nNoveltreat will be available in five dose strengths, 0.25 mg/0.5 mL, 0.5 mg/0.5 mL, 1 mg/0.5 mL, 1.7 mg/0.75 mL and 2.4 mg/0.75 mL, with a recommended maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly. The drug will be administered through a prefilled pen designed for self-use.\nThe approval positions Sun Pharma to compete in India’s fast-growing obesity and metabolic disease market once patent barriers fall, the company said.\nKirti Ganorkar, managing director of Sun Pharma, said the company aims to expand access to GLP-1 therapies after patent expiry, adding that Noveltreat meets global quality standards and is backed by Indian clinical data on safety and efficacy.\nMedical experts cautioned that GLP-1 therapies are not standalone solutions. Dr Unnikrishnan A G, chief endocrinologist and CEO of Chellaram Diabetes Institute, said such drugs should be used under medical supervision and combined with lifestyle interventions.\nThis is Sun Pharma’s second regulatory clearance for semaglutide in recent months. In December 2025, the company received DCGI approval to manufacture and market semaglutide for adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. That product will be sold under the brand Sematrinity, also post-patent expiry.",

        "full_content": "India’s largest airline IndiGo will hand back airport slots it is no longer utilising, as it undertakes a course correction following regulatory action triggered by large-scale operational disruptions last month.\nThe move comes after the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) ordered IndiGo to cut its flight schedule by 10% in December, following an unprecedented breakdown in operations that left more than 300,000 passengers stranded and resulted in over 4,500 flight cancellations.\nSpeaking to analysts, IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers said airlines have a responsibility to return slots they are unable to operate. “If airlines are operating certain slots, then it is the duty of the airline to hand back unutilized slots arising out of non-utilization or planned consolidations,” he said.\nElbers added that the airline has clarity on its operational plan for the near term. “We know what our plan is for the next two months. We are handing these slots back. Their reallocation though is the prerogative of the airports and that will be part of further evaluation going forward,” he said.\nIndiGo currently operates around 2,200 domestic and international flights daily. The airline has assured the regulator that it will maintain operational stability without flight cancellations after February 10, when a temporary exemption from the revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms expires.\nWhile Elbers declined to disclose the exact number of pilots employed by IndiGo, industry estimates suggest the airline has more than 2,400 Airbus captains against a requirement of around 2,280.\nOn January 17, the DGCA released key findings of a four-member inquiry committee set up to examine the causes behind IndiGo’s December disruptions. The committee concluded that the primary reasons were over-optimisation of operations, inadequate regulatory preparedness, deficiencies in system software support, and shortcomings in management structure and operational control.\nThe report said IndiGo’s management failed to identify planning deficiencies, maintain sufficient operational buffers, and effectively implement the revised FDTL provisions. These failures led to widespread delays and cancellations, severely inconveniencing passengers.\nFollowing the findings, the DGCA directed IndiGo to relieve Senior Vice President (Operations Control Centre) Jason Herter of his current operational responsibilities and barred him from holding any accountable position, citing failures in systemic planning and timely implementation of FDTL norms.\nResponding to the regulator’s orders, Elbers said to Moneycontrol the airline was reviewing them. “We are in receipt of the orders of the DGCA and they are being evaluated. The board and the management of IndiGo are committed to take full cognizance of these orders and will in a timely manner take the appropriate measures,” he said.\nHe added that the airline has initiated a broader internal review. “An in-depth review of the robustness of internal processes is on the way and we are engaging with the DGCA on the orders when it comes to ensuring a smooth transition and ensuring continuity and stability of the operations itself,” Elbers said.",

GSM operates exclusively with VinFast cars and scooters and will take on incumbents Ola and Uber.\n“The ride-hailing business will be independent from VinFast India operations. It will be buying the cars from us and operate them as fleet,” Ghosh said.\nVinFast also plans to launch three new electric vehicle models this year, adding to its existing VF6 and VF7 lineup. One of the upcoming models will be a seven-seater multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) aimed primarily at the taxi and fleet segment. At least one of the remaining models will be a compact SUV positioned against rivals such as the Tata Nexon EV.\n“There is a huge segment below the VF6 and we have to be present there,” Ghosh said. Currently, the VF6 is VinFast’s entry-level offering in India. It is priced at Rs 17.29 lakh.\nVinFast sold 826 cars in India in 2025 after starting sales in September but the company has not disclosed its sales targets for 2026. Its completely knocked-down (CKD) assembly plant in Tamil Nadu has an annual capacity of 50,000 vehicles, which can be scaled up to 150,000 units. The facility assembles imported kits from Vietnam, with about 10 percent localisation at present.\nIn the medium to long term, VinFast aims to significantly increase localisation levels to reduce exposure to uncertainties around battery and component supply. The company is also expanding its retail footprint, planning to increase dealerships from 35 in 2025 to 70 in 2026. Sales and dealership networks for two-wheelers and buses will operate separately from the passenger car business.",

The GI talks aim to help traditional European farming products sell more in India by addressing imitation and unfair competition.\nEU calls deal ‘historic’\nCommenting on the agri-food chapter of the agreement, Christophe Hansen, European Commissioner for Agriculture and Food, said: “Thanks to this historic trade agreement, the markets of nearly 2 billion people are joined together. Our agri-food exports to India have so far been held back by extremely high tariffs. Under this agreement European wines, spirits, beers, olive oil, confectionary, and other products will enjoy preferential access to the rapidly growing Indian market.”\nHe added that the agreement balances new market access with protections for sensitive sectors:\n“Front and centre to these negotiations, was maximizing new opportunities for our unmatched European products, while protecting European farmers. That is why the tariffs on the most sensitive products such as beef, sugar, ethanol, rice and poultry will remain in place. As in any trade agreement, our high food safety standards are fully maintained. The safety of EU consumers is non-negotiable,\" Hansen said.",

As of September 2025, over 6.8 crore MSMEs are registered on the Udyam Registration Portal and the Udyam Assist Platform, together employing nearly 30 crore people. MSMEs today are not peripheral contributors to the economy. They sit at its operational core.\nWhat has changed just as significantly is how these businesses function. Formalisation has accelerated, digital adoption has deepened, and financial connectivity has improved. Nearly three-quarters of MSME transactions are now digital. The growth of UPI has played a central role in this transition, with monthly transactions crossing 20 billion for the first time in August 2025. These are not abstract indicators. They reflect a fundamental shift in how small businesses manage cash flows, make payments, and interact with the financial system.\nThis progress has created a strong foundation for growth. It has also made the remaining constraints more visible. For many MSMEs, the challenge today is not access to markets or willingness to formalise. It is whether the systems around credit, compliance, and policy delivery are equipped to support scale.\nFrom the MSME sector perspective, four priorities stand out for the Union Budget 2026.\nModernise credit guarantee frameworks\nCredit guarantees have been among the most effective tools for expanding collateral-free lending to MSMEs. By sharing risk with lenders, they have unlocked credit at a scale traditional asset-backed models could not achieve.\nAs MSMEs become more data-rich and digitally visible, these frameworks must evolve. Expanding coverage limits, simplifying claim settlement processes, and extending eligibility to a wider set of growth-stage enterprises can materially improve lender confidence and reduce borrowing costs.\nThe next phase of MSME credit growth will be driven by cashflow-based lending rather than static balance-sheet assessments. Credit guarantees should align with this shift. When guarantees support real business performance, they move from being a safety mechanism to becoming an active enabler of scale. A dedicated Budget allocation to expand the MSME credit guarantee corpus, focused on cashflow-based models, would be a powerful catalyst for the next growth cycle.\nReduce compliance friction\nFormalisation has delivered clear benefits, but it has also increased the compliance burden on smaller businesses. For many micro and small enterprises, managing GST filings, audits, and reporting requirements still demands disproportionate time and effort, often falling directly on the entrepreneur.\nSimplifying compliance thresholds, rationalising reporting requirements, and reducing duplication across processes would immediately improve productivity. Continued progress toward unified digital compliance can ease operational strain without compromising transparency.\nEase of compliance is as critical as ease of credit. Regulation that is proportionate to scale encourages businesses to remain formal and grow within the system. Predictable compliance frameworks strengthen the ecosystem rather than slowing it down.\nInvest in financial literacy\nThe government has committed significant resources to supporting MSMEs through multiple schemes and direct benefit transfers. Yet, adoption on the ground remains uneven. Many entrepreneurs are unaware of available schemes or unsure how to navigate access. In other cases, limited understanding of financial products leads to hesitation or underutilisation.\nDedicated funding for regional outreach, borrower education, and digital onboarding can bridge this gap. When MSMEs understand how credit products work, how repayments are structured, and how digital tools simplify operations, confidence and responsible borrowing behaviour improve. Financial literacy is not a peripheral issue. It directly influences credit quality, borrower outcomes, and the long-term resilience of the MSME ecosystem.\nStrengthen market access\nWhere execution has been consistent, outcomes have followed. Government procurement from MSMEs demonstrates what is possible when access frameworks function as intended.\nThe broader challenge lies in ensuring similar consistency across programmes. Delays, fragmented processes, and uneven implementation dilute impact. Strengthening last-mile execution through clearer processes, better coordination between institutions, and simplified borrower journeys can significantly improve trust and effectiveness.For MSMEs, predictability matters more than novelty. Reliable access to credit, manageable compliance, and consistent support systems allow entrepreneurs to plan, invest, and scale with confidence.\nLooking ahead\nIndia’s MSME ecosystem has demonstrated that it can formalise, digitise, and grow at scale when the foundations are right. Budget 2026 has an opportunity to shift the narrative from inclusion to expansion by focusing on system-level strengthening rather than incremental additions.\nBy modernising credit guarantees, reducing compliance friction, investing in awareness, and improving last-mile execution, the Budget can help MSMEs move from resilience to scale. If India wants its small businesses to become global exporters and national champions, policy must now evolve from enabling participation to enabling growth at scale.\n(Alok Mittal, Co-founder & Executive Chairman at Indifi Technologies.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "India’s proposed trade agreement with the European Union is set to intensify competition for key exporters such as Japan, the UK and US, with nearly $11 billion in trade potentially becoming contestable, according to a Moneycontrol analysis.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi announced the agreement on January 27 at India Energy Week, describing it as a landmark partnership between two major economic blocs.\n\"A big agreement was signed between the European Union and India. People are calling this the mother of all deals. This agreement will bring major opportunities for the public in India and Europe. This is a perfect example of a partnership between two major economies of the world. This agreement represents 25% of the global GDP and one-third of global trade,” the Prime Minister said.\nThe impact of the deal is expected to be uneven across trading partners but significant in scale. Of Japan’s roughly $48 billion exports to India, nearly $3.5 billion, or over 17 percent, falls into product categories where EU suppliers could become more competitive once preferential access comes into force.\nThe exposure is sharper for the United Kingdom, where close to 20 percent of exports to India, amounting to about $1.3 billion, lie in segments where EU firms are well placed to displace existing suppliers.\nThe US, despite exporting a smaller absolute value of goods to India than Japan or the UK, could still face competition in nearly $5.8 billion of trade, or around 15 percent of its exports. Russia, by contrast, appears relatively insulated, with just over 1 percent of its exports to India exposed to potential EU competition.\nThe pressure points vary by country. Japanese exports at risk are concentrated in high-value engineering and industrial goods, including machinery, electrical equipment, engines, precision instruments and filtering systems. These categories overlap closely with European strengths, particularly in Germany, France and Italy, where firms already have deep integration with Indian manufacturing supply chains.\nFor the UK, vulnerable segments are skewed towards scrap metals, aluminium and paper waste, vehicle components and aircraft parts—products that form a substantial share of Britain’s industrial exports to India and could face margin pressure once EU tariffs are lowered.\nThe US faces competition mainly in medical and surgical instruments, diagnostic reagents, communication equipment, polymers and petroleum-based products. Several of these categories are already witnessing rising EU participation globally, and tariff preferences could further tilt sourcing decisions in favour of European suppliers.\nFor Japan, the UK and US, the challenge is likely to be less about headline trade losses and more about defending market share in high-value segments, where pricing, regulatory standards and delivery timelines matter as much as tariffs.\nAs India deepens its trade ties with Europe, exporters from advanced economies may find themselves competing more directly than before—not only with Indian firms, but increasingly with EU suppliers operating on preferential terms.",

Track live updates here.\n“India will grant the EU tariff reductions that none of its other trading partners have received,” the statement said, adding that duties on cars will be gradually reduced from 110 percent to as low as 10 percent, while levies on car parts will be fully eliminated after five to ten years.\nTariffs of up to 44 percent on machinery, 22 percent on chemicals and 11 percent on pharmaceuticals will also be mostly eliminated, according to the Commission.\nA dedicated chapter in the EU-India free trade agreement will also help small and medium-sized businesses in the bloc to take full advantage of the new export opportunities.\nBoth sides will establish dedicated contact points to provide SMEs with relevant information on the FTA and assist with any specific issues they encounter when using the agreement’s provisions. SMEs are expected to particularly benefit from tariff reductions, removal of regulatory barriers, and the transparency, stability, and predictability provided by the agreement, the Commission explained.\nThe European Union and India concluded negotiations on a “historic, ambitious and commercially significant” free trade agreement (FTA) on January 27.\n\"This is the most ambitious trade opening that India has ever granted to a trade partner. It will give a significant competitive advantage for key EU industrial and agri-food sectors, granting companies privileged access to the world's most populous country of 1.45 billion people and fastest growing large economy, with an annual GDP of €3.4 trillion,\" the statement said.\nAccording to the Commission, the agreement will strengthen economic and political ties between the world’s second- and fourth-largest economies at a time of rising geopolitical tensions and global economic challenges, underscoring their shared commitment to economic openness and rules-based trade.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the deal marked a historic moment in relations between the two sides.\n“The EU and India make history today, deepening the partnership between the world’s biggest democracies...we have created a free trade zone of 2 billion people, with both sides set to gain economically,\" she said.\nNext steps\nNow that talks for the trade deal has concluded, the negotiated draft texts will be published shortly.\nOn the bloc's side, the texts will go through legal revision and translation into all official EU languages.\nThe Commission will then put forward its proposal to the Council for the signature and conclusion of the agreement.\nOnce adopted by the Council, the EU and India can sign the agreements.\n\"Following the signature, the agreement requires the European Parliament's consent, and the Council's decision on conclusion for it to enter into force. Once India also ratifies the Agreement, it can enter into force,\" according to the statement.\nThe EU and India had first launched negotiations for a free trade agreement in 2007.\nThe talks were suspended in 2013 and then relaunched in 2022. The 14th and last formal negotiating round took place in October 2025, followed by intersessional discussions at technical and political level.\n\"After a year of tireless engagement and more than a decade in the making, we have delivered the biggest FTA ever, a deal like no other. High tariffs down, opportunity unleashed...Now, our focus is clear: ensuring businesses reap tangible benefits from this FTA as quickly as possible,\" Maroš Šefčovič, EU's Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security said.",

        "full_content": "When Ursula von der Leyen recently described the proposed EU–India trade agreement as “the mother of all deals,” the phrase drew attention not only because of its ambition, but because of the extraordinary journey behind it. Few trade negotiations have lasted over two decades, survived multiple global crises, and still remained politically relevant.\nNegotiations encapsulate evolution of India’s approach to trade\nThe EU–India free trade talks are not merely a delayed agreement waiting to be concluded. They are a record of how India’s trade positions evolved over time, shaped less by a grand plan and more by changing domestic politics, global economic shocks, and shifting geopolitics.\nThe 22-year timeline shows why India hesitated early, why talks collapsed midway, and why the present moment looks fundamentally different. With negotiations now approaching a political close after more than a dozen rounds since 2022, the timing of the EU–India FTA has become as important as its content.\nEarly ambition and the limits of openness\nThe idea of a comprehensive EU–India trade agreement took shape in the early 2000s, when globalisation was widely seen as a growth engine. Formal negotiations began in 2007 under the Broad-based Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA), one of the most ambitious trade frameworks India had attempted. The scope was expansive. It covered goods, services, investment protection, intellectual property, and public procurement. But ambition soon collided with political and economic realities.\nThe European Union pushed for deep tariff reductions, particularly in automobiles, wines, and spirits, alongside stronger intellectual property protections and access to India’s public procurement markets. India, meanwhile, focused on services access, professional mobility, and regulatory flexibility, areas where European willingness was limited.\nAgriculture and asymmetric liberalisation\nAgriculture and dairy became some of the most politically sensitive fault lines. For India, opening these sectors was not just a trade issue but a livelihoods concern, given the scale of smallholder farming and the role of dairy in rural incomes. European efficiency and subsidies sharpened these fears. While agriculture was not the only sticking point, it came to symbolise India’s discomfort with asymmetric liberalisation.\nBy 2013, talks collapsed. This was not the outcome of a coherent long-term trade doctrine. It reflected uncertainty, domestic constraints, and the limits of what India was willing, or able, to concede at that stage of its economic development.\nCollapse, recalibration, and a changing global order\nThe years between 2013 and 2021 were shaped by forces far larger than the EU–India negotiations themselves. Global faith in free trade weakened sharply. The eurozone crisis exposed structural fragilities. Brexit disrupted Europe’s own trade orientation. Most significantly, the election of Donald Trump altered the global trade environment. Under Trump administration trade wars, tariff threats, and open scepticism toward multilateralism became normalised. Trade agreements were no longer viewed as purely economic instruments. Trade increasingly became a tool of exercising power.\nThis shift mattered for India. The global trading system itself grew less predictable. Even advanced economies began prioritising industrial policy, supply chain control, and national interest over liberal norms.\nIndia’s own decisions reflected this uncertainty. The choice to stay out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in 2019 was driven by concerns about manufacturing competitiveness, trade imbalances, and loss of policy space. Rather than pursuing large trade blocs, India began reassessing what kind of openness it could sustain.\nThis period did not produce a clear trade strategy overnight. Instead, it forced India to adapt, learning through disruption rather than design.\nRe-engagement shaped by geopolitics, not ideology\nWhen EU–India negotiations resumed in 2022, the context had shifted decisively. Europe was seeking to reduce its dependence on China and diversify supply chains. India had gained economic scale and geopolitical weight. The relationship was no longer defined by optimism, but by mutual necessity. The structure of the talks reflected this realism. Instead of a single sweeping agreement, negotiations were split into three parallel tracks: a free trade agreement, an investment protection agreement, and a geographical indications deal. This allowed progress without forcing resolution of every sensitive issue at once.\nThe substance of the negotiations also changed. Tariffs remained important, but newer concerns moved to the forefront, climate regulation, sustainability standards, data governance, and carbon-related trade measures. These issues now shape access to markets as much as tariffs once did.\nA more confident India that’s at the same time more cautious\nIndia’s engagement today is more confident, but it is also more cautious. This is not openness driven by ideology or reformist zeal. It is openness shaped by experience, global uncertainty, and strategic positioning.\nA predictable business environment is the biggest gain\nFor businesses and markets, the significance of the EU–India FTA lies less in immediate trade gains and more in predictability. Clearer rules, regulatory stability, and long-term access matter more than headline tariff cuts. Export-oriented firms benefit from certainty. Services firms gain from institutional cooperation. Smaller firms will face higher compliance costs, underscoring the need for domestic support.\nFor Indian companies, the real impact of the EU–India FTA will be felt less through headline tariff cuts and more through long-term regulatory certainty in one of the world’s largest consumer markets.\nLet us be realistic about immediate gains\nHowever, the scale of this potential should not be overstated. While the FTA may widen market access, rising green compliance costs, particularly carbon-related levies and sustainability standards, are likely to limit immediate gains for Indian exporters. The real challenge will lie in navigating these costs while simultaneously negotiating long-standing red lines, such as wines and spirits, public procurement, intellectual property protections, services mobility, and sensitive sectors like dairy and agriculture. The agreement’s success will depend not just on market opening, but on how these overlapping constraints are managed in practice.\nThe agreement will not mark a dramatic opening of the Indian economy. It will reflect how India’s trade positions evolved under pressure, responding to global shocks, political shifts, and a more contested world economy.\n(Tarun Agarwal is an Associate Fellow at the Center of Policy Research and Governance, New Delhi, where he leads the International Relations and Conflict vertical.)\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "India’s household savings rate remains an ouroboros, with net financial savings inching up to 5.2% of GDP from a near 50-year low of 5%, while household investments slipped down to 18.1% of GDP in FY24. Household financial liabilities hit a record 6.2% of GDP, trapping us in a savings-investment rut: barely saving enough yet piling on debt. These indicate that households are thriving on debt-driven consumption over sustainable savings and incremental investments. Budget 2026 must incentivise savings and clear debt to maintain economic equilibrium. This fragile balance underscores the evasive value of a ₹500 note, for instance.\nYet macroeconomic triumphs – such as real GDP growth of 8.2% – belie the two “rupee realities” playing out daily in urban India. Walking into a fine-dining restaurant in Mumbai last week, a visitor ordered an appetizer: three artistic dumplings with microgreens and a delicately dolloped sauce. It cost ₹500. Later, while passing by a favourite Udipi joint on the way home, a signboard read “Full Veg Thali - ₹500”: three curries, a big portion of rice, two sides, a tall glass of buttermilk.\nThe contrast is jarring: same city, same ₹500; differential value. This sobering realisation transcends beyond Food & Beverage (F&B), to the entire goods and services continuum. Besides, these are affluent examples limited to the stronger economic classes of society.\nValue across socio-economic strata\nAt the other end, ₹500 barely covers a one-way Sleeper class train ticket for a family of two migrant workers returning home to Meerut from Mumbai, often forcing them to travel unreserved, or delaying family reunions. Likewise, ₹500 sustains an auto driver for a week: twenty vada pavs at ₹20-25 each in Maharashtra cities.\nThese contrasting vignettes reveal a deeper narrative: has currency become unmoored from any stable sense of value? What is ₹500 really worth?\nIn 2014, a little over ₹60 bought one US dollar; today, that figure is around ₹90. What is silently insidious about this is that no one wakes up one fine morning and has a sudden realisation that their wallet is lighter. It’s gradual. Quiet. And incredibly surreptitious.\nYet, this silent catastrophe unfolds amid controlled domestic inflation, at 0.71% YoY and increased GDP per capita (PPP) from $1,212 in 1990 to $11,159 in 2024. On paper, living standards have improved – yet every day feels costlier.\nA rationale may be opined: gradual currency depreciation isn’t an isolated economic event; it’s a societal phenomenon of living in two simultaneous rupee realities.\nBudget 2026 must bridge this value gap between fine-dining establishments which price imported ingredients in a weaker rupee and cater to a clientele with global lifestyle aspirations, and Udipi restaurants which haven’t recalibrated as yet: they think, act and price local. This is not a mere emotional dilemma; it is an overlooked policy issue.\nEmployment and the Two Indias\nAs Budget 2026 expectations build, urgency mounts around tax slab revisions to ease middle-class pressures and revive savings, production-linked incentives to capitalise on the manufacturing sector, GST fixes to aid the services sector, to name a few. Yet the 8.2% real growth momentum masks vulnerabilities as households grapple with record-low savings trends. The Budget must strike the iron when it’s hot: targeted tax breaks, guaranteed gig worker social security, unlocked MSME loans,  and incentivised household savings are tools.\nBeneath this macroeconomic gloss – and the controlled 0.71% inflation – lies an overlooked economic chasm. In metropolitan cities, upper middle-class to High-Net-worth Individuals (HNIs) pay millions to get lifestyle club memberships, waiting periods for which span generations. That remains a distant dream for lower socioeconomic strata. This is the classic dichotomy of two Indias: ₹500 is ‘necessary luxury’ in one, basic sustenance in another.\nTowards equitable recalibration\nEconomic growth lifts consumption, yet low savings delay spending on homes and small businesses. Over the last decade, 171 million people escaped poverty, alongside multidimensional poverty which dropped to 15.5% in 2022-23. Yet, the urban-rural gap persists. This is the ₹500 divide personified: luxury dumplings versus survival vada pavs; inequality starkly amplified despite macro wins.\nApathy runs deep: we make daily decisions clinging onto money’s ‘constant’ myth. But true recalibration for the poor isn’t merely crossing unclear purchasing power thresholds; it’s gaining complete agency over determining what ₹500 means. Budget 2026 must confront this: youth unemployment at 10.2% leaves skilled youth jobless despite rising LFPR, while a substantial proportion of gig workers lack equitable labour protections.\nPolicy muscle is needed, now. To wake up from our avoidant slumber, we need to develop a more nuanced understanding of the entire three dumplings-versus-full meal paradox. We somehow still treat currency denominations as if they are universal units of value. The mindset change? Valuing value itself. We need to recalibrate earnings, spending and societal implications every single day.\nThrough concentrated recalibration effort, Budget 2026 can convert 8.2% blurry growth of 5.2% fragile savings into a robust capex engine: the government strikes the spark; households supply the fuel. The solution lies in mobilising a proactive multi-stakeholder network.\nThe ₹500 puzzle reveals shared policy failure, not zero-sum trap. It shows that money means everything (to some), but also, nothing (to others). This realisation changes everything: all stakeholders of society win when we embrace that stability was always an unsaid myth.\nThe solution lies in equitable policy design. We can redistribute the power of ₹500, in a way in which the rich businessmen gain demand; the downtrodden wield agency. The Budget is an opportunity to deliver tax relief, gig security and MSME lifelines, leaving no players unequipped. Growth serves all – no outliers.\n(Ninupta Srinath is a policy researcher and a law student.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "The European Union's (EU) Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which became operational on January 1, 2026, has placed India into an uncomfortable position, especially on the eve of signing of a free trade agreement between India and the EU.\nCBAM imposes carbon costs on imports based on their embedded emissions, effectively penalising India for the lack of a price on carbon via a carbon market. The 'Brussels effect' is visible and the message clear. Adopt an EU style market-based carbon pricing, or face trade penalties.\nFor India, this presents an immediate challenge, although the long-term direction is less confrontational. The short-term dilemma is about space for its development goals; the luxury of carbon pricing can follow at higher levels of per capita income without impinging economic sovereignty.\nPricing for negative externalities\nThe neo classical view of carbon pricing is elegant: internalizing the social cost of carbon through a uniform price signal allows atomistic decision makers to reduce emissions where marginal abatement costs are lowest. This Pigouvian principle has shaped climate economics for decades and now underpins the EU's approach to global trade in carbon-intensive goods such as steel and aluminium to name just two carbon intensive products, among many.\nTheory of the second best\nFor India, however, the immediate adoption of economy wide carbon pricing would have adverse economic and distributional effects, atop an already skewed distribution of income and wealth. The reasons lie not in the rejection of climate responsibility, but in the prevailing ground realities and what economists refer to as the theory of the second best.\nIn simple terms, the theory of the second best reminds us that in the presence of multiple distortions, fixing just one may be counterproductive. In other words, carbon pricing works well when markets are reasonably competitive, information flows are free, credit is accessible and distributional impacts can be managed through fiscal transfers. India meets none of these conditions in any meaningful manner. Besides, more than 80 percent of India operates in an informal setting where price signals are weak or non-existent.\nConsider for example access to credit, or lack thereof, for small and informal sectors operating outside regulatory frameworks. Imposing a carbon price in such an environment will not result in resource reallocation; instead it is more likely to spawn closures.\nChallenge posed by informality\nSmall and medium enterprises, a source of over 110 million jobs, may not be able to switch to cleaner technologies that require upfront investments they cannot finance. Similarly, over 800 million people who receive free food rations will be forced to limit consumption of electricity in case prices go up. The parallel with a past policy shock is instructive. Recall what demonetization did to India's informal sector; the lack of digital access to money (liquidity) in 2016 witnessed the closure of thousands of small enterprises, a shock from which many never recovered.\nCarbon pricing imposed prematurely could trigger a similar disruption, well intentioned in theory, crippling in practice.\nIndia’s implicit carbon pricing\nIndia's approach to emissions reduction has relied on what might be termed implicit carbon pricing through regulatory standards, technology mandates, and sectoral policies. Renewable purchase obligations require electricity distributors to source a rising share of power from renewable sources. Energy efficiency standards mandate improvements in industrial processes, appliances, and vehicles. Production-linked incentive schemes support manufacturing of solar panels, batteries, and electric vehicles. Fuel taxes, among the highest globally on petrol and diesel, discourage consumption while generating revenue.\nOrthodox or text book economics is impatient with quantitative instruments that distort markets. For example, if one has to restrict trade, tariffs are better than quotas they say because they allow price signals to remain relevant. Quotas result in monopolies and rent seeking it is argued. All no doubt true, in addition to the fact such instruments also lack the theoretical elegance of a uniform price signal. At the same time, India's renewable energy capacity has grown from 35 GW in 2014 to over 200 GW in 2025, making it the fourth-largest globally. Energy intensity of GDP has declined by 36 percent since 2005. Coal's share in the energy mix is falling even as total energy consumption rises.\nTaking care of the demand side of the equation\nIndia's approach to renewable mandates has also generated assured demand, allowing investments in manufacturing thereby generating economies of scale. On the demand side, this idea is similar to the LED bulbs case in which government purchased in bulk and sold at low price to consumers, creating a virtuous cycle of adoption. The lesson is that subsidies reduce upfront costs, making clean energy accessible to those who cannot afford the lifecycle savings that carbon pricing promises. Standards bypass the information and credit market failures that prevent firms and households from responding optimally to price signals.\nTime to transition out of gradualism\nWhen I weigh the evolution of India's economic policy landscape over the last several decades, one feature that stands out like a shining example or a sore thumb depending on your perspective.\nIn the wise words of Montek Ahluwalia, India has largely adopted an approach of gradualism to reform, what he termed 'course correction' rather than disruptive transformation. This philosophy, reflected in Deng Xiaoping's metaphor of feeling the stones while crossing a stream, has largely characterized India's economic liberalization since 1991. Whether it has or has not served India well is a matter of debate, but policy shocks and therefore disruptions have been few and far between.\nToday, however, the global political economy is such that the luxury of a gradualist approach is fading. The EU, having committed to ambitious climate targets and imposed carbon costs on its own industries, insists through CBAM that trading partners adopt equivalent measures. The patience for differential treatment based on development needs, embodied in the principle of \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" or CBDR in climate negotiations has melted.\nInternational trade flows are supposed to reflect differences in costs of production. Lower environmental costs however are no longer a legitimate source of comparative advantage. Even if we in India are willing to phase in stricter regulatory standards around climate change over time, the EU is in no mood to submit. This impatience is not entirely unreasonable because climate change is a global emergency and leakage of emissions to jurisdictions with lax standards undermines the EU's efforts. Or so we are told. If India can produce steel at lower cost partly because it faces no carbon constraints, European steelmakers face 'unfair' competition.\nAppropriate measure for reciprocity\nBut here is the rub. Reciprocity premised on identical instruments rather than comparable outcomes could be termed unfair (and inefficient). India's per capita income is one-thirtieth that of the EU. Its per capita cumulative emissions are a fraction of Europe's historical contributions. India's development imperatives, including ensuring energy access, require rising energy consumption even as emissions intensity of production declines. Imposing the luxury of carbon pricing immediately poses challenges, while ignoring ground realities.\nThe relevant question should not be whether India has an economy-wide carbon price matching the EU's €85 per tonne, but whether India's policy mix delivers comparable emissions trajectories adjusted for development stage and capacity.\n(Rajat Kathuria is Dean, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Shiv Nadar University, and Professor of Economics.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "Global uncertainty has emerged as the single biggest concern for economists heading into the FY27 Budget, overtaking domestic inflation and fiscal risks, according to a pre-Budget poll of 20 economists.\nWhen asked about their primary concern for the economy, six respondents cited US and global headwinds, making it the most frequently flagged risk. These include trade protectionism, slowing global growth, and heightened geopolitical tensions.\n“No trade deal with the US could impact labour-intensive sectors leading to unemployed workers,” said Yuvika Singhal, economist at QuantEco Research.\n“Even as growth is fine, it’s not clear this will be a self-sustaining recovery given global risks and role of one off domestic tailwinds in FY26,” said Abhishek Upadhyay of ICICI Securities, highlighting that he remained cautiously optimistic.\nThe second-largest concern was private investment, highlighted by five economists, reflecting unease over whether corporate capex will pick up sufficiently as public investment begins to plateau.\nCapex, though expected to rise to Rs 12 lakh crore, would be lower at 3.05 percent of the GDp compared with 3.14 percent in the previous fiscal, according to Moneycontrol poll.\nConcerns around employment, consumption, recovery momentum, and nominal GDP growth featured next, though each drew fewer responses, indicating that domestic macro conditions are viewed as relatively stable for now.\nEconomist forecast nominal growth to hit 10.1 percent of the GDP in the coming fiscal.\n“A quicker pick-up in private corporate investment given that govt capex will need to start moderating to meet fiscal consolidation objectives,” said Dipti Deshpande, economist at Crisil.\nNotably, inflation, exchange rates, and credit conditions also attracted concern from some economists.\nThe story was also visible in economist’s concern around manufacturing and trade facilitation.\nNearly 90 percent of the economists noted that the government may continue its policy of manufacturing push in the upcoming budget, while 94 percent projected the government to expand the ambit of its schemes on trade facilitation.\n“Measures that help improve export competitiveness -especially through lower power and logistics costs and further easing of regulatory constraints. Given that significant role of MSMEs in export-intensive sectors such as textiles, leather, and plastics which have been disproportionately affected, the budget could be expected to announce more targeted support to the MSME segment,” said Deshpande.",

Economists expect the government to reach its medium-term debt stabilisation goal, with the debt-to-GDP ratio projected at a median of 55.2 percent in FY27. Estimates were tightly clustered between 54.6 percent and 55.7 percent, signalling limited concern over fiscal slippage.\n//\nIndia has set a target of bringing its debt-to-GDP ratio down to 50 percent by FY31, and the government is expected to increasingly shift focus from headline deficit numbers to debt metrics. For the previous fiscal year, the debt-to-GDP ratio was projected at 56.1 percent.\nThe relatively benign outlook reflects expectations of steady nominal GDP growth, moderate expenditure discipline, and continued reliance on market borrowing rather than off-budget financing.\nGross market borrowing is expected to remain elevated at Rs 16.5 lakh crore, but economists appear comfortable that higher borrowing will be absorbed without materially worsening debt dynamics, particularly if growth assumptions hold. For FY26, gross borrowing was already raised to Rs 14.82 lakh crore, from Rs 14.01 lakh crore in the previous fiscal.\nOn the growth front, economists expect the economy to record nominal GDP growth of 10.1 percent this fiscal, providing a supportive backdrop for fiscal consolidation efforts.",

        "full_content": "The Union Budget for FY27 is expected to remain expansive, though economists see signs of capex consolidation rather than acceleration, according to a pre-Budget survey of 20 economists conducted by Moneycontrol.\nThe median estimate for the total size of the Budget stands at Rs 53 lakh crore, with forecasts ranging from Rs 51.8 lakh crore to Rs 54.2 lakh crore. The range indicates expectations of continued high government spending even as fiscal consolidation remains a stated priority.\nThe government had projected total expenditure to cross Rs 50 lakh crore in FY26. However, ANZ economist Dhiraj Nim believes actual spending may fall short, estimating it at Rs 49.6 lakh crore in the current fiscal.\nCapital expenditure for FY27 is projected at a median of Rs 12 lakh crore, with estimates spanning Rs 11.5 lakh crore to Rs 13.1 lakh crore. As a share of GDP, capex is expected to stabilise at around 3.05 percent, marginally below the peak levels seen in recent years.\nIn FY26, capital expenditure, though lower in absolute terms at Rs 11.2 lakh crore, was estimated at 3.1 percent of GDP at the time of the Budget, underscoring how capex intensity has remained elevated even as growth rates begin to normalise.\nHSBC economists Pranjul Bhandari and Ayushi Chaudhary note that the government may meet its FY26 capex target and raise the allocation to Rs 12.3 lakh crore in the upcoming Budget.\nHowever, the pace of capex expansion is expected to moderate. Economists estimate growth of around 9 percent in FY27, compared with a 17 percent increase expected in the current fiscal, assuming the government meets its targets.\n“Continued emphasis on capital expenditure but with a shift in focus towards digital infrastructure and defence capital assets should be the priority,” said DK Srivastava, chief policy advisor at EY India.\nGross market borrowing is expected to remain elevated, reinforcing expectations that capex will continue to be financed primarily through debt rather than expenditure compression. Borrowing is projected to rise to Rs 16.5 lakh crore in FY27, even as the fiscal deficit is expected to ease to 4.2 percent of GDP from 4.4 percent in the current fiscal. Government debt is also projected to edge lower to 55.2 percent of GDP.",

        "full_content": "As India stands at the cusp of the Union Budget 2026–27, the economic narrative is shifting from “recovery” to “resilient acceleration”. While the traditional engines of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP)—infrastructure, government spending, and consumption—continue to provide a sturdy base, the next frontier of India’s 8% GDP growth trajectory lies in the high-stakes world of innovation and deep technology. I believe Budget 2026 must be the catalyst that transforms India from a “service hub” into a “global IP powerhouse”.\nThe RDI Fund: From allocation to execution\nIn the previous budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman took a historic step by operationalising the ₹1 lakh crore Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI) Fund under the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF). The Ministry’s intent was clear: science- and technology-led growth must power India’s rise. Over the past year at haf.vc, I have observed a 30% increase in deep-tech pitches in just the last six months, focused on building the future of India.\nHowever, a significant portion of this corpus has been set aside for strategic deep-tech sectors. For Budget 2026, the mandate must be to accelerate the deployment of these funds. It has also been noted recently that 2026 will be a defining year for founders who can manage growth effectively through innovation. I expect the Finance Ministry to introduce more “Second-Level Fund Managers” (SLFMs) to ensure that the ₹20,000 crore annual tranches reach early-stage start-ups in AI, quantum computing, and semiconductors.\nBeyond infrastructure: the climate-tech imperative\nWhile industry continues to focus heavily on infrastructure, the real risk to GDP growth is not a lack of roads, but a shortage of indigenous patents. The government’s emphasis on capital expenditure has strengthened physical infrastructure such as roads and railways; however, the quality of investment must now pivot towards climate technology to future-proof growth.\nBudget 2026 should incentivise private equity flows into circular economy models and green hydrogen. By reinforcing the Ministry’s earlier commitment to “Atmanirbharta in energy”, the upcoming budget can unlock private investment through targeted tax credits for climate-tech R&D, distinct from traditional manufacturing incentives.\nNavigating global headwinds: the FTA strategy\nSome of our past investments have struggled amid global tariff headwinds, particularly in electronics and textiles. The current geopolitical climate has exposed the vulnerability of Indian exporters. With the rupee experiencing volatility through much of 2025, Budget 2026 must provide a fiscal cushion to enhance “cross-border resilience”.\nThe Finance Ministry’s recent stance has leaned towards strategic trade realignment. I expect this budget to:\n* Accelerate FTA integration: Increase allocations to the Department of Commerce to finalise high-quality FTAs with partners such as the UK, New Zealand, the EU, and Oman, reducing over-dependence on any single Western economy.\n* Mitigate rupee volatility: Introduce measures to encourage the internationalisation of the rupee, lowering transaction costs for MSMEs engaged in cross-border trade and enabling them to scale globally under the “Brand India” banner.\n* Tilt the balance of trade: Extend Productivity Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes to MSMEs with annual revenues of ₹100 crore and above, moving beyond assembly towards core component manufacturing and directly addressing the trade deficit.\nConsumption: the resilient anchor\nDespite global headwinds, India’s Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) has remained a pillar of strength. The Finance Ministry has previously highlighted “uplifting household sentiment” as a core objective.\nFor consumption to drive GSDP sustainably, however, it must be powered by rising disposable incomes rather than expanding credit. I expect Budget 2026 to prioritise rural demand recovery, ensuring that the consumption engine is fuelled by productivity gains and local manufacturing, supported by innovation in agriculture.\nThe role of innovation in boosting GDP\nOver the past 15 years, India’s innovation and start-up ecosystem has evolved from comfort-driven solutions to convenience-led platforms. As Dr Jitendra Singh recently noted, “India is no longer the India of yesterday; our aspiration is to lead the technologies of the future.”\nWith over 170,000 start-ups, innovation is central to achieving the “Viksit Bharat” vision. Innovation-led growth has a multiplier effect on GDP that traditional sectors often lack. When a deep-tech start-up in Hyderabad secures a global patent in health-tech or space-tech, it creates high-value jobs and attracts long-term, sticky foreign direct investment.\nBudget 2026 must continue the momentum of decriminalising minor procedural lapses and simplifying the regulatory framework for Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs). At a time when consumption-led growth is reaching an inflection point, regulatory friction risks slowing the investment cycle that is critical for sustained expansion.\nConclusion: the roadmap for 2026\nThe synergy between government spending, private consumption, and infrastructure has propelled India into the global top five economies. To advance into the top three, Budget 2026 must focus on deepening the RDI pool, scaling climate-tech incentives, diversifying trade through FTAs to shield Indian innovation from global tariff conflicts, and boosting domestic productivity by incentivising the “component creator” over the “assembler”.\nI see 2026 as the year when capital meets curiosity. If the upcoming budget can bridge the gap between R&D laboratories and global markets, India’s investment-led growth will become a lasting legacy—not merely a statistic.\n(Rathnakar Samavedam, Investment Director and Managing Partner at Hyderabad Angels Fund).\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "In September 2018, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in the Aadhaar case, which addressed the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar Act. One of the key issues before the Court was whether the passage of the Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill was constitutionally valid.\nTwo contrasting views on Aadhaar Act falling within purview of a Money Bill\nJustice Ashok Bhushan, writing for the majority, held that Parliament was competent to pass the Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill under Article 110 of the Constitution. He reasoned that the primary objective of the Act is to facilitate the delivery of State subsidies and benefits, the expenditure for which is drawn from the Consolidated Fund of India. Article 110(1)(c) provides that a Bill qualifies as a Money Bill if it contains provisions relating to the custody of the Consolidated Fund of India. Relying on Article 110(3), Justice Ashok Bhushan concluded that the Aadhaar Act satisfied the constitutional requirements of a Money Bill.\nIn contrast, Justice DY Chandrachud dissented, holding that the passage of the Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill was unconstitutional. He emphasised that for a Bill to qualify as a Money Bill, it must contain only those provisions that fall within clauses (a) to (g) of Article 110(1). According to Justice Chandrachud, a close reading of the Aadhaar Act reveals that it regulates several aspects of the Aadhaar scheme that extend beyond the scope of Article 110(1). Moreover, he held that Section 7 of the Act does not itself authorise expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India; it merely makes Aadhaar mandatory in cases where such expenditure is incurred.\nWhile the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar Act was upheld and the majority accepted its passage as a Money Bill, Justice Bhushan affirmed that the matter is subject to future judicial review.\nIn July 2024, the then Chief Justice of India, DY Chandrachud, said that the Supreme Court would soon take a decision on listing the “Money Bill” issue for hearing. Earlier, in October 2023, the Supreme Court had stated that it would constitute a seven-judge Constitution Bench to adjudicate the matter. The question of which Bills can validly be classified as Money Bills was originally referred to a seven-judge Bench in November 2019 by a five-judge Bench led by then Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi in the Roger Mathew v. South Indian Bank Ltd case.\nUnique place of the Money Bill\nThe Money Bill is one of the most important legislative provisions entrusted to the legislature within the Indian parliamentary system. What makes a Money Bill unique is its subject matter and special procedural safeguards. As defined under Article 110 of the Indian Constitution, a Money Bill deals exclusively with financial matters such as taxation, public expenditure, and issues relating to the Consolidated Fund of India.\nA Money Bill can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha and requires the prior recommendation of the President, making presidential consent an inherent requirement in its introduction. Unlike ordinary legislation, the Rajya Sabha does not have the power to amend or reject a Money Bill; it may only make recommendations, which the Lok Sabha is free to accept or reject.\nFurthermore, the authority to decide whether a Bill qualifies as a Money Bill rests with the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. Under Article 110(3), the Speaker’s decision is final.\nEvolution of Money Bill\nThe framers of the Indian Constitution borrowed the principle of bicameralism from the British parliamentary system. The origin of conferring a limited role on the Upper House in the passage of Money Bills can be traced to the British Parliament Act, 1911.\nSection 3 of the Act accords finality to the Speaker’s certification of a Money Bill and places it beyond judicial scrutiny. It expressly provides that any certificate issued by the Speaker of the House of Commons under the Act shall be conclusive for all purposes and shall not be questioned in any court of law.\nLong backstory of the Money Bill\nAn understanding of India’s constitutional history is essential to fully appreciate the scope and implications of the finality accorded to the Speaker’s decision on whether a Bill qualifies as a Money Bill.\n* In India, the categorisation of Money Bills can be said to have begun from the Commonwealth of India Bill 1925, which was drafted by a National Convention comprised of 250 members, with Tej Bahadur Sapru as its Chairman.\n* Article 17 of the Nehru Report also defined a Money Bill.\n* The draft prepared by the Constitutional Advisor, BN Rau, defined a Money Bill. Article 75 of this Draft Constitution provided that “if any question arises whether a Bill is a ‘money bill’ or not, the decision of the Speaker of the House of the People thereon shall be final.”\n* Section 37 of the Government of India Act 1935 made special provisions for financial bills.\n* The statutory concept of a “Money Bill” and the Speaker’s power to certify a Bill as such, originally introduced by the British Parliament Act, 1911, was incorporated into the Indian constitutional framework with significant modifications. While the 1911 Act accorded absolute finality to the Speaker’s certification by expressly providing that it “shall not be questioned in any court of law,” the framers of the Indian Constitution consciously departed from this language and instead adopted the phrase “shall be final.”\n* This distinction is significant, as the British constitutional system is founded on parliamentary sovereignty, whereas the Indian constitutional order is premised on the supremacy of the Constitution. Judicial review is an essential feature of the Indian constitutional scheme as it ensures that all constitutional authorities act within the bounds of the Constitution. Consequently, no constitutional institution in India, including the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, exercises unfettered or absolute power. The Speaker’s decision to certify a Bill as a Money Bill is therefore not immune from judicial scrutiny and may be examined on the touchstone of compliance with constitutional principles.\nSpeaker’s decision doesn’t have immunity from judicial scrutiny\nAs highlighted by the apex court in the Aadhar judgment, the claim that the Speaker’s decision is immune from judicial review and cannot be challenged runs counter to the fundamental framework of the Constitution, which is founded on principles of “transparency, fairness, and non-arbitrariness”.\nIn the Aadhar case, the apex court made a significant point. It stated that the constitutional function is entrusted to the Speaker to certify a Bill as a Money Bill under Article 110(3), to which the attributes of a judicial power do not apply. Indeed, the power which is entrusted to the Speaker under Article 110(3) is integral to the legislative process. But the fact that the authority which a constitutional functionary exercises is not of a judicial character is not sufficient to lead to the conclusion that a finality clause governing the exercise of that power makes it immune from judicial review.\nThe apex Court in the Aadhar case also dealt with the question whether the Speaker’s decision under Article 110(3) is protected by Article 122. It opined that Article 122 will not save the action of the Speaker if it is contrary to constitutional norms provided under Article 110. The Court, in the exercise of its power of judicial review, can adjudicate upon the validity of the action of the Speaker if it causes constitutional infirmities. Article 122 does not envisage exemption from judicial review if there has been a constitutional infirmity. Justice A. K. Sikri, writing for the majority, observed that Article 212 only limited challenges on the ground of ‘irregularity of procedure’ and not ‘substantive illegality’.\n(Views are personal, and do not represent the stance of this publication.)",

        "full_content": "These are extraordinary times, and instinctively, countries are pivoting towards unprecedented policy measures to boost growth and, more importantly, build resilience to sustain momentum in a fast-evolving global order. The free-trade world order as we have known it appears to be significantly upended, with an emerging trade regime shaped by strategic multi-alignment in foreign policy.\nIndia’s growth outlook\nIndia, as part of the Global South and among the fastest-growing large economies, is well positioned to deliver high growth over the next decade. At the same time, it will increasingly bet on strategic bilateral and multilateral relationships, with policy choices closely aligned to its geopolitical priorities.\nBudget a pivotal policy moment\nIn this context, Budget 2026 represents a hugely significant moment in India’s policy landscape. This year’s budget announcement could serve as a crucial pivot in India’s industrial and trade policy framework, underpinning its geopolitical deftness while sharpening the contours of the domestic growth agenda. A particular emphasis is likely to be placed on boosting urban and rural consumption, with the aim of triggering a virtuous cycle of private and public investment.\nFrom a taxes and duties standpoint, Budget 2026 presents a valuable opportunity for the government to undertake tariff reforms and realignments, and to address structural deficiencies such as inverted duty structures. Doing so would enable businesses to optimally leverage the benefits of bilateral free trade agreements and impending multilateral trade agreements with key partners. In an environment of rising economic nationalism and protectionist tariff regimes globally, this could emerge as one of the most significant takeaways.\nTax certainty and investment confidence\nMoreover, with the income tax law due for a reset in April 2026, sweeping structural changes should not be expected in this budget. However, there is scope to refine the legislation slated for implementation, particularly to enable more flexible mergers, acquisitions, and restructuring. This could include resolving persistent issues such as the taxation of contingent payouts, ensuring full tax neutrality for all forms of demergers, and delivering last-mile simplification of the capital gains tax regime by eliminating selective instances of tax rate arbitrage.\nThe growing incidence of litigation arising from the administration of the General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR) warrants a serious review of their scope and application, before these issues snowball into a major impediment to foreign direct investment inflows. Claims for tax benefits under bilateral tax treaties with certain investment partner countries often face excessive scrutiny, which tends to unsettle even bona fide investors by increasing uncertainty around tax costs for both primary and secondary investments. The issuance of clearer guidelines on the application of these rules would go a long way towards making India’s tax framework more predictable and investor-friendly.\nFinally, there is an urgent need for targeted incentives for R&D and investments in new technologies such as AI infrastructure. Historically, India’s tax regime has been largely neutral, with only a handful of fragmented incentives that have done little to encourage large-scale investment in these areas. As AI increasingly influences nearly every sector, Budget 2026 offers a timely opportunity to democratise access to the benefits of this technological revolution by enabling risk capital to flow more freely, supported by a calibrated and purposeful tax incentive framework.\n(Sumit Singhania, Partner, Deloitte India.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

Alongside its steady appetite for Russian Far East ESPO Blend, Beijing has also ramped up imports of Russian Urals crude to a record 405,000 bpd in January — the highest level since mid-2023 — according to data from energy consultancy Kpler.\nIndia, which had emerged as the largest buyer of Russian Urals by sea after the European Union embargoed Moscow’s oil in 2022, cut its purchases to below 1 million bpd in December. This marked a sharp fall from the average of about 1.3 million bpd seen last year, LSEG data showed. Indian refiners are expected to keep imports of Russian oil close to 1 million bpd in January as they diversify supply sources.\nTurkey, another major buyer of Russian crude, has also pared back its intake. Urals imports into Turkey slipped to around 250,000 bpd in January, compared with an average of 275,000 bpd in 2025 and well below the peak of nearly 400,000 bpd recorded in June last year.\n“As Indian and Turkish buyers cut purchases recently, some Russian Urals cargoes headed for China,” said a trader involved in Russian oil sales. He added that the surplus availability of Urals barrels has weighed on prices.\nReflecting weaker demand elsewhere, discounts for Urals crude delivered to China in late 2025 widened to as much as $12 a barrel below ICE Brent for certain cargoes. Currently, Urals differentials are hovering near a $10-per-barrel discount to the global benchmark, according to two traders active in the Asian market.\nTraders noted that demand for Urals crude in India and Turkey — both key exporters of diesel to Europe — has softened after the EU banned fuels made from Russian-origin crude, further reshaping global oil trade flows.",

An India–EU FTA would thus deliver classic trade gains, higher volumes, deeper integration and stronger industrial competitiveness on both sides, at a moment when such economically rational trade arrangements are becoming increasingly rare,” Srivastava said.\nIn February 2025, India and the EU decided to ramp up talks for the proposed free trade agreement, targeting to initially close it by the end of that year to tide over ongoing disruptions from volatile trade policies.\nBeing negotiated for nearly two decades, the India-EU trade deal has 24 chapters across goods and services.",

The proposed overhaul has been detailed in a discussion paper released for stakeholder consultation.\nAt present, India’s quarterly GDP estimates rely on a benchmark–indicator approach, where high-frequency indicators are aligned to annual national accounts benchmarks. While this ensures consistency with annual data, it produces sharp revisions and visible breaks in the series whenever annual numbers are updated.\nMoSPI now plans to move to a proportional benchmarking technique, a method widely used in advanced statistical systems globally. Instead of forcing quarterly data to mechanically align with annual totals, proportional benchmarking preserves the underlying movement of economic indicators. According to the discussion paper, this shift should result in smoother quarterly growth trajectories and fewer abrupt revisions.\nA central pillar of the revamp is the expansion of high-frequency administrative data used to estimate economic activity. GST return data is expected to play a larger role in tracking trade, manufacturing and services, while vehicle registrations from the e-Vahan database will help refine estimates in transport and related sectors. Energy indicators, such as natural gas consumption, are likely to improve measurement in industrial activity and utilities.\nThese additions are particularly significant for sectors like construction, transport, trade and manufacturing.\nThe changes will be rolled out alongside the broader rebasing of national accounts. The revised quarterly GDP series, aligned with the FY23 base year, is scheduled to be released in February 2026, together with updated annual GDP estimates.",

        "full_content": "The Reserve Bank of India’s annual supervisory inspection for FY25 has flagged inconsistencies in how a few private sector banks classified agriculture loans under priority sector lending (PSL), triggering provisions and reclassification of certain consumption-linked loans.\nWhile the issue does not raise asset quality concerns, it has brought back focus on divergent interpretations of PSL norms and disclosure practices among banks.\nMoneycontrol explains the issue, why it surfaced during the RBI’s annual inspection, and why it is a classification challenge rather than an asset quality concern.\nSo, what is the issue?\nAgriculture loans,  which form the chunk of priority sector lending (PSL), is extended based on the area of cultivable land available and a corresponding valuation attributed to it. Norms also permit banks to lend a certain value (up to 20 percent of total permissible limit) towards the consumption requirements of the borrower. A two-wheeler loan, for instance can be a consumption loan as helps improving the working conditions of the borrower.\nHowever, the combined value of all loans should fall within the overall commercial valuation attributed to the land. For a few banks, this wasn’t the case, with the combined value exceeding the permissible loan amount which the borrower is entitled to. Excesses were largely found largely with respect to the consumption loans.\nThe banking regulator wants this anomaly corrected.\nHow did the problem surface?\nThe discrepancies were found in the process of annual inspection for FY25, which the Reserve Bank of India periodically conducts across regulated entities. Inspection revealed that agri-loans lent by a few banks were non-compliant with PSL norms as non-agro loan component exceeded the permissible loans amount of the borrowers. Hence as corrective step, these loans (loans given for consumption purpose) need to be reclassified as they don’t fall within the PSL limits.\nIs this as asset quality concern?\nThe issue relates to asset classification rather than asset quality, according to sources. It is understood to be limited to a handful of private sector banks, with Axis Bank, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank having already taken corrective steps. No such pattern has been observed among public sector banks.\nCan it be reversed?\nYes. Any reversal, however, is expected to be gradual and unlikely before March 31, 2028. The first step would involve reclassifying these loans as non-agriculture advances, a process that would require banks to formally notify borrowers. Any regulatory dispensation or moratorium extended earlier would also need to be regularised, including interest rates, as several of these loans had benefited from interest subvention available to agriculture credit. As a result, borrowers could face higher lending rates post-reclassification, which may test their repayment capacity. While this risk has not been factored in so far, a deterioration in repayment ability could eventually have implications for asset quality.\nHow have banks approached the issue?\nWhile the underlying issue is common across India’s top three private sector banks, their approaches to disclosure have varied significantly. A bank-by-bank look highlights these differences.\nAxis Bank\nDiscrepancies in agri-loans portfolio was first brought to fore by Axis Bank in its September FY26 quarter results. The bank flagged off in its notes to accounts about a certain elevated provisioning it took in Q2FY26 pertaining to its agri-loan portfolio flagged off by the RBI’s annual inspection. “…we will not give you details around specific number of accounts. The bank had been offering one of the two product variants from 2015 and the other variant from 2021. These are farmer loans and these had been classified as PSL. The bank has discontinued these two product variants, i.e., we are not doing these specific variants currently. For the loans that we had in stock, the bank has taken a position that the customer terms should not be changed to the detriment of the customer have an issue,” the bank’s CFO, Puneet Sharma told in a post earnings call with investors. “We have declassified these loans from our PSL computation entirely and we purchased the PSLCs for which the cost I have explained. The Rs 1,231 crores translates roughly a 5 percent cover on the total outstanding pool as of the 30 September,” he replied to another question in the call. Terming the provision as ‘static’ on the call, he said the bank does not expect an increase in credit costs from previous years for these two (dis)continued loan product variants. Sharma also indicated that “when the Rs 24,000 crores (of loans) goes to zero, I will get the full credit back into my P&L on that date”, which is expected by March 2028.\nHDFC Bank\nHDFC Bank did not mention the agri-loans related issue in its notes to accounts or press releases. Had it not been for a question raised by Mahrukh Adajania, a senior equity researcher at Nuvama Institutional Equities, the Rs 500 crore of provisioning the bank took on these loans post the RBI annual inspection would have not been made public. “Our regulatory inspection is also complete, and whatever according to required -- according to the regulatory requirement, there was about Rs 5 billion (Rs 500 crore) or so thereabouts, which have been taken. In the overall context of our book and our results they have been absorbed within that. In future, we need to operate in a model that is acceptable with the regulatory, whatever is that is (and) that’s an ongoing process of what we do. Any one-time is already subsumed,” said Srinivasan Vaidyanathan, CFO, HDFC Bank. While in terms of quantum the provisioning is not material, that fact that India’s largest private bank had to wait for a question to be raised in its investor call to address an important point flagged off by the RBI in its annual supervision isn’t comforting. Ideally, the bank should reported the RBI observation voluntarily. When asked why the bank did not make a voluntary disclosure, its response was “Please note that this does not cross any regulatory threshold that warrants a disclosure in the Q3FY26 results. The Bank continues to have adequate provisions at the total level. On the Investor call, the answer provided was in response to a specific question from an Analyst. And both call details - Investor and Media calls - are in the public domain for transparency”.\nICICI Bank\nWhile in terms of absolute value, ICICI Bank’s provisioning towards agri-loans portfolio was the highest at Rs 1,283 crore, the bank needs to be appreciated for its disclosure standards. It was voluntary and it revealed that it was done as per RBI’s supervision report. “….following the supervisory review, the regulator has directed us to make this provision of Rs 1,283 crore. The underlying portfolio that we need to work out and resolve in terms of ensuring conformity with the PSL guidelines would be between Rs 200 billion to Rs 250 billion or so (Rs 20,000 – 25,000 crore). We will be working on to bring this portfolio into conformity with the regulatory expectations, and thereby, minimise both the provisioning and the PSL impact,” said Anindya Banerjee, CFO, ICICI Bank adding that the bank has been originating this portfolio for some years.\nOverall, the PSL-related issue evokes memories of the asset quality review phase of 2016–18—not in terms of the scale of stressed assets, but in the way similar exposures can be interpreted differently by banks. The key concern is the lack of uniformity in interpretation, even as the system remains far from a repeat of the bad-loan cycle. For now, the issue appears contained, though market participants will be watchful for any further developments.",

The narrowing of the gap between nominal and real GDP growth was reflected in the fall in GDP deflator inflation, which dipped to its lowest level in 2025-26.\nEconomic activity continued to register a strong growth in December. E-way bill generation continued to record healthy growth, supported by GST rate rationalisation, alongside stock clearance and firms’ efforts to meet year-end sales targets. Growth in GST revenue collections was primarily driven by higher import-related GST receipts, bulletin added.",

        "full_content": "After sharply paring exposure to group credit life insurance amid stress in the microfinance (MFI) segment over the past year, India’s private life insurers are beginning to see early signs of recovery, with management at leading companies pointing to a turnaround in the December quarter.\nMoneycontrol has earlier reported that the number of lives covered by insurers declined sharply in FY25 as rising mortality claims and asset-quality stress in microfinance forced insurers to retreat from group credit life insurance, which is a product typically bundled with MFI loans that settles outstanding dues in the event of a borrower’s death.\nRegulatory disclosures shows that India’s top four private life insurers — HDFC Life Insurance, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, SBI Life Insurance and Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance — together cut group insurance operations by nearly 30 percent year-on-year in FY25, almost double the industry-wide contraction of 16 percent. The pullback was largely driven by a reduction in credit life exposure linked to MFI loans.\nLending stablising\nIn a Q3 earnings call, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance chief financial officer Dhiren Salian acknowledged that weakness in the MFI-linked credit life business weighed on growth over the nine-month period but said the trend began to reverse in Q3.\n“In the nine months, we do have an impact of slower growth, or rather decline, that we have seen in the MFI business of credit life. The good part is that we are starting to see MFI turn around. I wouldn't say it’s out of the woods yet, but very clearly, we have started to see a turnaround coming through in Q3,” Salian said.\nThe improvement reflects broader stabilisation in microfinance lending. “This is in line with the commentary you’re hearing generally around MFI credit, the core business of credit. As that business starts to build up, we should be a natural beneficiary of that,” he said.\nPremium data underscores the scale of the pullback. HDFC Life’s group new business premium (NBP) declined 25 percent year-on-year in FY25, ICICI Prudential 28 percent, SBI Life 30 percent and Bajaj Allianz Life’s declined 23 percent. As a result, the number of lives covered by these four insurers fell by a combined 4.7 crore, from 18 crore in FY24 to 13.3 crore in FY25, marking a 25 percent contraction.\nAn official at one insurer attributed the retreat to worsening claims experience. “The high-risk borrower pools and increasing claims have made it difficult to sustain large-scale credit life portfolios,” the official had said, pointing to post-COVID volatility in the MFI sector.\nInsurers are now seeing early green shoots. HDFC Life Insurance reported a sharp rebound in credit-linked protection in the December quarter. Managing director and chief executive officer Vibha Padalkar said during the earnings call, “Credit protect rebounded strongly in quarter three. The MFI segment saw a pickup aided by a favourable base, while non-MFI segments continued to deliver steady growth.”\nThe recovery in credit-linked business is part of a broader strengthening in protection-led growth, she said. “Retail sum assured grew 33 percent over the nine-month period and 55 percent in quarter three. This growth was supported by higher rider attachment and increased sum assured multiples in ULIP business, reinforcing the quality of growth and alignment with long-term protection objectives,” she said.\nMargin pressure to ease\nHDFC Life CFO Niraj Shah said credit life, which is a pure protection product, has begun to perform strongly as system-wide credit growth improves.\n“Credit life as a segment has started to do really well, with around 25 percent growth in this quarter and about 15 percent growth for the period,” Shah said. “With the credit growth in the overall system being at fairly strong levels and expected to continue to improve, that is also a business line which will further the cause.”\nShah added that improving scale in protection and credit-linked business should help ease margin pressures over time. “As we start moving towards growth numbers that we are capacitised for, the negative variance that you see on account of fixed cost leverage is something that we would expect to try and bring down over time,” he said, citing regulatory changes such as GST rationalisation and stronger embedded protection within unit-linked products as key catalysts.\nMoneycontrol has earlier reported that the sharp fall in credit life policies could prompt regulatory scrutiny, with a source indicating that the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) may consider measures such as premium floors or targeted incentives to ensure coverage in socially critical but low-margin segments like credit life. The regulator did not respond to queries at the time of publishing of this report .\nFor now, insurers say they remain selective.\nBoth ICICI Prudential and HDFC Life stressed that they are agnostic to how customers buy protection, whether through group credit life, pure term plans or embedded protection, as long as the business meets defined risk-reward and quality thresholds.",

The dividend projected in the earlier budget will be realised after the end of the current financial year, as banks typically declare and transfer dividends after finalising their annual results. The RBI, meanwhile, generally transfers its surplus to the government in May.\nIn May 2025, the central bank paid a record Rs 2.69 lakh crore dividend to the government, reflecting higher income from foreign exchange operations amid global market volatility.\nDividend transfers from the RBI and PSBs have emerged as a key source of non-tax revenue for the government in recent years, helping provide fiscal headroom even as capital expenditure remains a priority.\nIn financial year 2024-25, the central bank net sold $69.661 billion, and purchased $25.15 billion. Such heightened selling of dollars may have increased the revenue for the central bank.\nThe logic implies that like in any commercial transaction, the RBI accumulated dollars cheap and sold it when the price rose. The central bank accumulated dollars in the 83-84 range a dollar and sold in the 84-87 range.\nThe RBI dividend is a major revenue source for the government. As the manager of its finances, the RBI pays a dividend to the government to help from its surplus profit.",

Macquarie cautioned that assumption changes expected in Q4FY26 could pose downside risks to ICICI Prudential’s FY26 margins and EV, despite stable current profitability.",

        "full_content": "The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is likely to maintain the status quo on interest rates in its February policy review, a Moneycontrol poll of 14 economists, bank treasury heads and fund managers has found.\nThe rate-setting panel is likely to draw comfort from the higher growth and inflation averaging around the medium term target of 4 percent, the majority of experts said.\n“The status quo is driven by expectation that FY27 inflation will average at 4 percent which is target levels. Growth indicators show pickup in domestic demand supported by GST cuts and monetary policy easing by RBI,” said Gaura Sengupta, Economist at IDFC First Bank.\nHowever, few experts believe that the central bank will cut rates by 25 basis points (Bps) in the upcoming monetary policy.\nThe MPC is to meet from February 4 and February 6 for its bi-monthly policy review.\nSince February, 2025, the MPC has reduced the repo rate by 125 bps to aid growth, with a 25 bps cut each in February and April, 50 bps in June, and 25 bps in December. However, the RBI has kept repo rate unchanged in August and October monetary policy.\nThe central bank will stick to its “neutral” stance and keep its tone dovish in the upcoming policy, experts said. This tone is targeted at lowering interest rates to increase spending and lending, as well as giving a boost to growth.\n“Since both inflation and growth is panning out broadly in line with expectations, we do not see any convincing reason to change the monetary policy stance (or action),” said Vivek Kumar, Economist at QuantEco Research.\nInflation projection\nMost economists and experts remained on the divided view on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation projections. This is because, few experts said the central bank may remain in wait and watch mode before revising inflation forecast ahead of the new base year series for GDP and CPI.\nIndia’s inflation firmed up in December, rising to a three-month high of 1.33 percent from 0.7 percent in November, government data released on January 12 showed.\nEven with the uptick, headline inflation has now stayed below the RBI’s lower tolerance threshold of 2 percent for four consecutive months, underlining how price pressures have cooled meaningfully since the middle of the year.\nFor the year as a whole, inflation averaged about 2.2 percent in 2025, making it one of the lowest readings seen in over a decade, helped largely by a sharp easing in food prices.\nDecember also marks a transition point for India’s inflation statistics. It is the final consumer price index (CPI) reading under the 2012 base year. Starting with the January print — due on February 12 — the CPI series will shift to a new 2024 base, with an updated consumption basket that includes more items and assigns a higher weight to non-food components.\nThe change is significant because the current CPI is heavily food-weighted, with food accounting for more than half of the index. This makes headline inflation highly volatile, as sharp swings in vegetables, cereals or pulses can move the overall number even when non-food prices remain stable.\nGDP forecast\nSimilar to inflation, experts also remained divided on revision in growth projections.\nFollowing India’s impressive 8.2 percent GDP growth in the recent fiscal period, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has announced that the third-quarter (Q3) GDP for 2025–26 will be released using the new base year of 2022–23.\nSubhash Garg, Secretary at MoSPI, said on November 28, “The first advance estimate in January will follow the existing 2011–12 base, but the second advance estimate on February 27 and Q3 numbers will be calculated on the new base. To ensure continuity, we will also release Q1 and Q2 in the new series.”\nThe upcoming GDP series marks the first base-year revision since 2011–12.\nThe revised GDP methodology aims to better capture India’s evolving economic structure, including informal-sector activities and more accurate measurement of gross value added (GVA) across key sectors.\nIn December monetary policy, the RBI projected real GDP growth for 2025-26 at 7.3 per cent, with Q3 at 7.0 per cent; and Q4 at 6.5 per cent. Real GDP growth for Q1:2026-27 is projected at 6.7 per cent and Q2 at 6.8 per cent.",

Last time when the currency breached the 91 level against the greenback was on December 17, when it hit 91.06, according to Bloomberg data.\nThe rupee has been under pressure despite the dollar index being on a declining trend.\nForeign investors withdraw more than $3 billion\nAmit Pabari, managing director at CR Forex Advisors, explained this saying that foreign outflows remain the single-biggest drag.\nForeign investors have withdrawn more than $3 billion from Indian equities so far in January, and the steady outflow has made the rupee increasingly sensitive to even modest dollar demand. With capital moving out, stability becomes harder to defend.\n“Beyond FPI flows, trade uncertainty continues to hover in the background. The most critical unresolved issue remains the prospects of a comprehensive and balanced trade agreement between India and the United States,” Pabari added.\nThe Greenland angle\nFurther, the issue over Greenland has put pressure on the local currency.\n“Continued global uncertainties, including US pressure on Greenland, have led to a risk-off sentiment in markets. This has led to a strong demand for precious metals, with gold and silver prices touching an all-time high. The risk-off sentiment, along with strong offshore hedging in USDINR, has led to the USDINR touching 91 per dollar. The current macro environment is likely to maintain depreciating pressure on the INR,” said Sameer Karyatt, Executive Director and Head of Trading at DBS Bank India in a report.\nFurther, the DBS report said that US President Donald Trump’s campaign to impose American rule over Greenland in the name of national security is a concern.  Following a decision by Denmark and several European NATO allies to send military personnel to Greenland for an exercise, Trump threatened to impose a 10 percent additional tariff on goods from the UK, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland, starting February 1.\nThese levies are scheduled to rise to 25 percent on June 1 until a deal for the \"Complete and Total purchase of Greenland\" is finalised. This move has effectively derailed the July 2025 \"Turnberry\" trade agreement, which had temporarily stabilised tariffs at 15 percent, in exchange for zero duties on US industrial goods, the DBS report added.",

        "full_content": "India’s insurance industry is expected to see strong premium growth continue over the medium term, helping offset weak underwriting performance and rising claims, as insurers face capital pressures from faster business expansion and regulatory changes, according to a report by Moody's.\nMoody’s expects India’s economy to grow by 7.3 percent in FY26, up from 6.5 percent in FY25, supporting higher household incomes and demand for insurance products. Reflecting this trend, total insurance premiums rose 17 percent in the first eight months of FY25 to Rs 10.9 trillion, sharply accelerating from the 7 percent growth recorded in FY24.\nGrowth has been broad-based.\nLife insurance new business premiums rose 20 percent, while health insurance premiums increased 14 percent during the period, highlighting rising risk awareness among consumers.\nMoody’s noted that insurers’ increasing reliance on digital channels has significantly improved access and distribution, aligning with the regulator’s long-term goal of “Insurance for All” by 2047.\nDespite the rapid growth, insurance penetration remains low. Premiums accounted for just 3.7 percent of GDP in FY24, compared with 11.8 percent in the UK and 12.1 percent in the US, indicating significant headroom for expansion in the Indian market.\nState-owned sector reform key to pricing discipline\nA major constraint on profitability has been weak pricing discipline, largely driven by the dominance of state-owned insurers. According to Moody’s, public sector insurers have historically prioritised market share over underwriting profitability, exerting downward pressure on premiums across the industry.\nThe government’s ongoing efforts to reform the state-owned insurance sector, including recapitalisation, potential mergers, privatisation and the earlier minority stake sale in LIC, are seen as credit positive. Moody’s said improved underwriting discipline among public insurers would help support pricing across the market.\nHowever, the agency cautioned that the timing of these reforms remains uncertain, as similar initiatives have faced operational and legislative delays in the past. State-owned non-life insurers still accounted for 61 percent of the sector’s underwriting losses in FY24, even though their share of total premiums has fallen to 31 percent, from over 40 percent before FY20.\nClaims pressure weighs on underwriting results\nWhile the industry reported an after-tax profit of $8.1 billion in FY24, it remained loss-making at the underwriting level, due to rising claims in both life and non-life segments. Claims increased 6.4 percent in life insurance and 6.6 percent in non-life insurance during the year, Moody’s said.\nThe agency noted that any sustained improvement in pricing, particularly if led by reforms in the state-owned sector, would allow insurers to better absorb claims inflation, supporting solvency and profitability over time.\nMoody’s also highlighted the positive impact of the government’s decision in September 2025 to exempt individual life and health insurance policies from GST. The move has already led to higher new business volumes, with year-on-year growth in retail life and health premiums accelerating in FY25, supported by improved affordability.\nWhile the tax exemption is expected to lift insurance penetration further, Moody’s cautioned that some of the benefit to insurers may be offset by the loss of input tax credits now that GST is no longer levied .",

        "full_content": "L&T Finance's multi-year shift away from wholesale lending towards a predominantly retail portfolio is beginning to show clear financial gains, with NIMs plus fees rising 19 basis points sequentially to 10.41 percent in the latest quarter, driven by higher microfinance and rural loan disbursements, managing director and chief executive officer, Sudipta Roy told Moneycontrol in an interview.\nHe added that the loan book is now 98 percent retail, helping improve yield efficiency even as interest rates soften. At the same time, credit costs declined to 2.83 percent from 2.98 percent in the previous quarter, with the company guiding towards a further moderation to 2-2.2 percent by Q4FY27, signalling improving asset quality after last year’s microfinance stress.\nEdited excerpts:\nCan you explain how the loan book has evolved over the last few years?\nWe started with a loan book of around Rs 80,000–85,000 crore, with a roughly 50:50 mix between wholesale and retail. As we initiated our Lakshya programme, we started deleveraging our assets, we consciously reduced wholesale exposure. As a result, the overall book actually shrank for almost two years, around six to seven quarters.\nGrowth resumed around mid-2023, driven primarily by retail. Wholesale assets are bulky and low-yielding, they offer operating efficiency but not margin efficiency. Retail, on the other hand, delivers higher NIMs but is more manpower-intensive.\nAs wholesale assets tapered off and retail picked up, our NIMs and fees improved meaningfully. At peak, NIMs plus fees touched around 11.15 percent. They moderated subsequently but have started moving up again as microfinance disbursements revived. This quarter, NIMs and fees improved by about 19 basis points, which is a meaningful expansion.\nHow has retailisation impacted margins and credit costs?\nRetailisation has clearly helped margins. As higher-yielding businesses like microfinance, gold loans,  two-wheelers and personal loans gained traction, NIMs and fees moved up.\nOn credit costs, while there was a spike last year due to microfinance stress, that has now stabilised. Credit costs this quarter stood at 2.83 percent, down from 2.98 percent in the previous quarter (on a core basis). We expect credit costs to gradually trend down to around 2–2.2 percent by Q4 FY27.\nOverall, retailisation has led to higher margins, improving credit costs and better return metrics. Today, we are effectively a 98 percent retail-focused institution, and the remaining 2 percent will run down over the next couple of years.\nDespite RBI rate cuts, NIMs have risen from 8.24% in Q1 FY26 to 8.58 percent now. How did you manage this?\nWhen interest rates were rising earlier, we did not pass on rate hikes across most products, except home loans. Businesses like two-wheelers, tractors and microfinance have sufficient spreads and are not very sensitive to repo movements.\nNow that rates are coming down, we benefit because we don’t need to reduce rates in most segments. Only the mortgage book, about Rs 28,000 crore out of a total Rs 1.14 lakh crore, gets impacted. Even within that, only the home loan portion (65-70 percent) is rate-sensitive.\nThe recent improvement in NIMs is largely due to higher microfinance and rural business loan disbursements, which are our highest-yielding products.\nWhat is your guidance for NIMs plus fees for the year?\nWe have consistently guided that NIMs plus fees will remain in the 10-10.5 percent range. Depending on interest rate and cost pressures, it may move within that band, but we don’t expect it to fall below 10 percent in the medium term.\nGiven that we have navigated the microfinance challenges successfully, we see a good opportunity to grow this book, which should keep us closer to the upper end of the range.\nWhy did CRAR decline by about 1 percent quarter-on-quarter?\nThe decline is purely due to strong book growth, around 21 percent. We actually want leverage to increase. Debt/Equity(Average) has risen to 3.67, implying total leverage of around 4.67. As growth accelerates, capital naturally gets utilised.\nWhich segments drove disbursements in Q3?\nQ3 was significantly stronger than Q2. Two-wheeler disbursements rose to Rs 3,217 crore, while tractor disbursements jumped to Rs 2,783 crore from Rs 1,654 crore in Q2. Rural business finance, including microfinance, also performed well, with disbursements of about Rs 6,740 crore. Festive demand and rural recovery played a key role.\nWhat is the status of super bike loans?\nThis is a niche segment. We finance about 100-120 super bikes per month. These bikes are priced around Rs 20 lakh and are fully imported, so the market is limited. We don’t expect any major scale-up here, especially given rupee depreciation making imports more expensive.\nGold loan book grew 18 percent in Q3. What’s the outlook?\nGold loans should perform very well. We are opening one branch every day and expect to reach around 330 branches by Q4FY26. Around 64 new branches have already been rolled out. The impact of this expansion should start reflecting meaningfully from next quarter onwards.\nWhile we don’t give specific growth guidance, gold loans will contribute within our overall AUM growth guidance of 20–25 percent.\nHow have you managed to reduce borrowing costs?\nWe’ve actively optimised our borrowing mix. About 26 percent of our borrowings are PSL-linked, which are 1.25-1.5 percent lower than the normal cost. We have also prepaid certain expensive bank borrowings and replaced them with market instruments like NCDs, CPs, SIDBI loans and ECBs raised when conditions were favourable.\nAs a result, normal bank borrowings have reduced from 28 percent last year to 23 percent now. High-cost borrowings have been systematically replaced with lower-cost funds.\nHow do you see borrowing trends going forward, especially with expectations of rate cuts?\nBorrowing growth will track book growth. If the loan book grows at 20-22 percent, borrowings will rise in line with that. RBI’s liquidity measures have kept short-term rates soft, which helps us tap CP markets efficiently.\nOur ALM allows CP exposure of up to 15 percent, though we stay well within that. Overall, we remain comfortable with our borrowing mix and cost trajectory.",

        "full_content": "South Indian Bank has accelerated its shift towards higher-yielding retail and non-corporate assets, reducing short-term corporate lending and lengthening the tenor profile of its balance sheet, managing director and chief executive officer PR Seshadri told Moneycontrol in an interview.\nCorporate disbursements declined in the December quarter, as the bank moved away from short-duration loans that offer lower spreads. Extending asset tenors helps improve margins, even though it reduces liquidity from very short-term corporate assets, he said. Edited excerpts of the interview:\nThis has been another strong quarter on asset quality and profitability. What drove the Rs 374 crore profit?\nMultiple factors contributed to the performance. First, average assets grew at a healthy 11-12 percent year-on-year, which supported income growth. More importantly, the asset mix improved meaningfully. We saw strong growth in non-corporate businesses, which are higher yielding. As a result, net interest income rose 9 percent quarter-on-quarter between Q2 and Q3. This sequential improvement, rather than a year-on-year comparison, added significantly to revenues and flowed through to profitability.\nIn addition, we have been steadily re-architecting our balance sheet. Retail, MSME and gold loans now form a larger share of the book, helping revive net interest income. Margins expanded by 6 basis points (bps) quarter-on-quarter to 2.86 percent from 2.80 percent. Alongside this, stringent cost controls over the last two years ensured strong operating leverage, boosting profits.\nYou have been focusing more on higher-yielding assets. Is that why corporate disbursements fell sharply?\nYes, that is largely by design. We are consciously de-emphasising short-duration corporate assets and lengthening the tenor of our asset book. Earlier, we had a large proportion of very short-duration loans, which provided liquidity but came at lower spreads. By moving towards longer-duration assets, we earn better yields. This shift explains the decline in corporate disbursements and also supports margins over time.\nGold prices have risen in recent months. How did gold loan advances perform in the December quarter and what about LTVs?\nThe gold loan book grew strongly, rising about 26 percent year-on-year. We have implemented the new RBI guidelines on income-yielding gold loans, where permissible LTVs are slightly higher than the earlier 75 percent cap.\nWhile there has been some upward movement in LTVs, they remain well contained. The average portfolio LTV is around 65 percent, including portfolio purchases. For income-yielding, non-agriculture gold loans—where borrowers can demonstrate business cash flows, LTVs tend to be marginally higher, but overall risk remains well managed.\nLast year, gold loan growth was about 13 percent and you sounded cautious due to rising prices. How do you explain the 26 percent acceleration?\nThe acceleration reflects our improved preparedness. We built robust systems to leverage the new RBI policy and strengthened risk management frameworks. Gold prices have also shown relative stability at current levels.\nWe now use a value-at-risk framework to assess the impact of potential gold price movements on the portfolio based on historical trends. Based on these risk assessments, we were comfortable that risk levels were acceptable, which allowed us to accelerate growth in this segment.\nNRI deposits have grown consistently over the past few years but saw a modest sequential growth in Q3. Why?\nOn a year-on-year basis, NRI deposits have actually grown well, about 9 percent so far, and we are seeing strong momentum in account openings, CASA balances and overall volumes compared to last year.\nWith the rupee trading near 90 to the dollar, many NRIs see this as an attractive time to remit funds to India. We do not see this as a concern and expect growth to improve going forward.\nWhat is your outlook for NRI deposit growth?\nWe expect NRI deposit growth to move into double digits. In the near term, 12–13 percent growth is a reasonable expectation, and it could trend towards the mid-teens.\nHow does rupee depreciation impact NRI deposits?\nRupee depreciation generally encourages remittances into India. NRIs remit funds both for family needs and to build savings or a corpus in India. When exchange rates and interest rates are favourable, the latter category of remittances increases.\nAdditionally, rising geopolitical uncertainty often leads NRIs to park more funds in India. All these factors should support deposit growth in the 12–14 percent range.\nOn the liabilities side, how much of the RBI’s 125 bps rate cut has been transmitted and what is the impact on margins?\nWe transmit repo rate changes on a T+1 basis. So the December 25 bps cut was fully transmitted the next day. However, since it came mid-month, the impact on margins in the quarter reflects less than a full month.\nIn the current quarter, we will see the full impact of the 25 bps cut. That said, a large portion of our deposits are also being repriced during the quarter, which will partially offset the margin impact. Overall, we expect the impact on margins to be only a fraction of the repo cut.\nIf there is another rate cut in February, that impact is not factored in yet, but we do not expect a material hit to revenues.",

        "full_content": "India's gross market borrowing for the financial year 2026-27 is expected to rise to Rs 15–17 lakh crore due a sharp surge in redemptions even as the government stays committed to fiscal consolidation while focusing on debt sustainability,  a Moneycontrol pre-Budget poll has found.\nNet borrowing is estimated in the range of Rs 10.5–14 lakh crore, with most market participants expecting the fiscal deficit to be contained around 4.3–4.4 percent of GDP in FY27. Economists, treasury heads and money market experts participated in the poll.\nThe government budgeted Rs 14.82 lakh crore as gross borrowing for FY26, higher than the Rs 14.01 lakh crore the previous year.\nGovernment borrowings are among the most important determinants of interest rates in the economy. Higher-than-expected borrowings can push up rates for all bond issuers — sovereign and corporate —  while interest rates can decline if it tightens its belt and borrows less than anticipated.\nBorrowings are loans taken by the government to fund its spending on public services. Usually, the government borrows the money through securities such as government securities and treasury bills.\nGovernment borrowing expectations\nRedemptions to drive higher gross supply\nThe increase is largely being driven by higher bond maturities, estimated at Rs 5.47 lakh crore in FY27, compared with about Rs 3.3 lakh crore in FY26. This will push up headline borrowing numbers even if the deficit ratio continues to decline.\n“Redemptions are expected to surge in FY27, which will mechanically push gross market issuances higher,” said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA, who estimates gross borrowing at around Rs 16.9 lakh crore, with net issuances of about Rs 12.2 trillion.\nFiscal consolidation remains intact\nDespite higher supply, market participants do not see any major deviation from the fiscal glide path. The government is expected to rely on nominal GDP growth, steady tax buoyancy and non-tax revenues to keep borrowing in check.\nMataprasad Pandey, vice-president at Arete Capital Service, said the lower end of borrowing estimates reflects the government’s “continued emphasis on fiscal consolidation” and the potential support from India’s inclusion in the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index, which could ease borrowing pressures.\nAt the same time, risks remain. Pandey said “weaker indirect tax collections following GST rate cuts” could push borrowing higher if the weakness persists into FY27.\nNet borrowing seen manageable\nNet borrowing is expected to remain broadly stable, clustered around Rs 11-12.5 lakh crore, supported by steady demand from domestic institutional investors and incremental foreign inflows.\nBalasubramanian R, head of treasury at Dhanlaxmi Bank, said net supply of around Rs 10.5 lakh crore is “manageable for the market”, with pension funds and foreign portfolio inflows aiding absorption.\nBorrowing strategy: maturity mix in focus\nThe government is expected to avoid a heavy tilt towards ultra-long bonds, given limited appetite for duration. Issuance is likely to remain balanced across short- and long-term maturities, with tactical use of treasury bills and selective long-tenor bonds to meet investor demand.\n“There is no expectation of a sharp increase in long-term borrowings; the mix is likely to remain broadly similar,” said Alok Singh, group head of treasury at CSB Bank.\nSome expect the government to rationalise issuances beyond 15 years to contain borrowing costs amid elevated spreads.\nGreen bonds to stay limited\nSovereign green bonds are likely to remain part of the borrowing programme but without any meaningful increase in issuance due to the absence of a green premium.\n“Despite the absence of a greenium for sovereign green bonds, the government is likely to include them in its borrowing programme,” Pandey said, adding issuance levels are unlikely to rise.\nEstimates for green bond issuance range from Rs 20,000-25,000 crore, or around 5 percent of the total borrowing.\n“Green bond around 5 percent of the issuance,” said Gopal Tripathi, head of treasury at Jana Small Finance Bank.\nShift towards debt-to-GDP anchor\nA broader shift in the fiscal framework is also underway, with policymakers placing greater emphasis on debt-to-GDP metrics alongside annual deficit targets.\n“There is a clear shift from focusing only on the fiscal deficit to managing the debt-to-GDP ratio,” said Umesh Kumar Tulsyan, managing director at Sovereign Global Markets, DDING the Centre aims to gradually bring down its debt ratio towards 50 percent over the medium term.",

        "full_content": "As India prepares for the Union Budget 2026, housing finance institutions are looking beyond incremental measures to structural reforms that can meaningfully improve housing affordability and expand homeownership. With urbanisation accelerating, household aspirations evolving and first-time buyers entering the market in larger numbers, the Budget presents an opportunity to recalibrate policy levers in line with today’s economic realities.\nAffordability is the key\nAffordability remains the single most critical factor shaping home-buying decisions. While interest rates, income growth and supply dynamics play a role, fiscal and regulatory support continue to be decisive enablers, particularly for the affordable and mid-income housing segments.\nFrom a housing finance perspective, the focus this year must shift to modernising definitions, deepening access to credit and strengthening last-mile execution.\nRevisiting the definition of affordable housing\nOne of the most pressing structural gaps today lies in the definition of affordable housing itself. The current property value threshold of Rs 45 lakh no longer reflects market realities. Over the past few years, land prices, construction costs, regulatory compliance expenses and input inflation have increased significantly, especially across Tier 1 cities and rapidly growing Tier 2 hubs. As a result, even modest, end-user homes often fall outside the existing affordability bracket.\nIncreasing the affordable housing limit from Rs 45 lakh to Rs 75 lakh would be a logical and market-aligned reform. This change would not dilute the intent of affordable housing; rather, it would modernise it. A revised threshold would allow policy benefits to reach genuine middle-income and first-time buyers who are currently excluded despite facing affordability constraints. For housing finance institutions, such a move would also create greater clarity in product design and eligibility, enabling more targeted lending without encouraging speculative demand.\nStrengthening tax incentives for home buyers\nTax benefits have historically played a catalytic role in encouraging home ownership. While existing deductions on home loan interest and principal repayment have provided relief, there is scope to enhance their effectiveness. A higher interest deduction limit for self-occupied homes, especially for first-time buyers, could improve monthly affordability and purchasing confidence.\nEqually important is continuity and clarity. Stable, long-term tax incentives allow buyers to plan better and lenders to design products with greater certainty. From a sector standpoint, predictable policy signals are far more effective than short-term stimulus.\nLowering the cost of credit and expanding access\nAccess to affordable credit is central to boosting housing demand. Housing finance companies and banks have significantly strengthened their underwriting, risk management and digital capabilities over the past few years. Budgetary support that enables further reduction in the cost of funds, whether through targeted refinancing windows, partial credit enhancement mechanisms or expanded priority sector allocations can help lenders pass on benefits to borrowers.\nFor underserved segments, especially informal income households and self-employed borrowers, policy-backed risk-sharing co-lending partnerships can unlock credit flow without compromising asset quality. This is particularly relevant in Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets, where demand is strong, but formal credit penetration remains uneven.\nAccelerating supply-side execution\nAffordability is as much about supply as it is about demand. Faster project approvals, rationalisation of GST on under-construction properties and incentives for developers focused on mass housing can improve supply efficiency and pricing discipline. A coordinated push to streamline approvals at the state and local levels would reduce project timelines, lower financing costs and ultimately benefit home buyers.\nIn parallel, continued investment in urban infrastructure such as transport, water, sanitation and connectivity enhances the liveability and value of affordable housing projects, making them more attractive to end-users.\nA long-term vision for housing-led growth\nHousing has always been a long-gestation sector, but affordability cannot wait. Union Budget 2026 could reset the housing narrative by aligning policy with today’s price realities and evolving buyer profiles. Affordability today is about relevance, not relief, and if the focus shifts to execution-led reforms rather than incremental tweaks, housing can once again emerge as a reliable driver of economic momentum while turning home ownership from a stretched aspiration into a practical, confident decision.\n(Mehernosh Tata is MD & CEO, Godrej Housing Finance.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

Also, five years period for acquisition or completion from the year of borrowing should be dispensed with,\" NAREDCO said in its recommendations to the Union Ministry of Finance on January 22.\nCurrently, under Section 24(b) of IT Act 1961 (Section 22 of IT Act 2025), deduction on account of interest payment on housing loans is permissible to owners of rented dwelling units to the fullest extent. In case of owner-occupied houses, the limit is set at Rs 2 lakh.\nParveen Jain, President, NAREDCO, said that rationalising taxation, especially on housing finance, will directly stimulate end-user demand.\n“The move will provide much-needed impetus to a sector grappling with a significant housing shortage and offer relief to homebuyers impacted by project delays arising from cash flow constraints, while restoring overall buyer confidence,” he said.\nNAREDCO has also suggested the reinstatement of the Income-tax Settlement Commission. The commission established in 1976 to provide taxpayers a one-time opportunity to enter into a compromise and settlement arrangement with the Income-tax Authority to grant them relief from penalties and prosecution, was discontinued with effective from February 1, 2021.\n\"Restoring and strengthening dispute resolution mechanisms like the Income-tax Settlement Commission is critical for fostering a transparent, investor-friendly environment in the real estate sector. Coupled with rationalized taxation policies, these reforms will catalyse sustainable growth, boost housing affordability,\" said, Niranjan Hiranandani, Chairman, NAREDCO.\nThe recommendations gain significance as the real estate sector comprises about 7-8 percent of India's GDP and is the second largest employer after agriculture with about 19 percent of the country's total workforce.\nThe developers’ body also recommended that entities engaged in real estate business should be exempted from the burden of tax on notional rental income, as there is a need to incentivise rental housing in India.",

        "full_content": "India’s housing market is entering a new phase this year, with lifestyle and sustainability-led preferences set to play a decisive role in home-buying decisions, industry insiders have said.\nAnnual housing demand is expected to remain around 30–40 million square feet in 2026, with new supply estimated at 35–40 million square feet, a report by real estate consultancy Colliers India  has said.\nMarket observers says buyers are increasingly prioritising wellness, sustainability, efficiency and long-term liveability, reflecting evolving urban lifestyles and the growing influence of work-from-home and hybrid work models.\nLifestyle and wellness take centre stage\nLarger homes, integrated lifestyle amenities, open green spaces and community-oriented planning are fast becoming central to purchase decisions, they said.\nGaurs Group CMD Manoj Gaur said buyers are far more conscious about how a home supports their lifestyle over the next decade.\n“In 2026, demand will increasingly gravitate towards developments that offer wellness-focused amenities, green open areas, and sustainable design. Buyers are not just looking at square footage—they want experience-led living and environments that enhance overall quality of life,” he said.\nYamini Agarwal, CMO, Nimbus Realty, lifestyle-oriented homes are no longer limited to luxury buyers.\n“We are seeing strong interest even from end-users upgrading from mid-segment housing. They want larger homes, better air quality, open spaces, and a sense of community. Projects that integrate lifestyle and sustainability from the planning stage are seeing better absorption and stronger buyer confidence,” she said.\nSustainability moves from optional to essential\nMarket observers say sustainability is fast becoming a core driver of residential demand, propelled by rising awareness of climate risk, higher utility costs and a desire for healthier living spaces.\nAccording to a report by Carbon Guardians, a sustainability-focused real estate solutions firm, India’s green building market is projected to grow to nearly $85 billion by 2032.\n“Developers who embed sustainable features at the planning stage such as rainwater harvesting, solar integration, waste-management systems, and low-carbon materials are seeing better traction in the market,” Gaur added.\nGautam Kanodia, Founder, KREEVA and Kanodia Group, said energy-efficient and ESG-aligned homes are attracting not only lifestyle buyers but also institutional interest, as sustainable design becomes an increasingly important metric for long-term value and investment quality.\n“Sustainability and lifestyle aren’t just buzzwords, they’re becoming core decision filters for buyers. Future-ready homes with strong ESG credentials are likely to outperform in both absorption and resale value in 2026,” he said.\nBranded housing to lead growth\nThe Colliers report also points to broader market trends supporting lifestyle and sustainability-led demand.\nDevelopers are responding by launching branded and experience-oriented projects that combine premium lifestyle amenities with strong design and sustainability measures, targeting buyers who value comfort, long-term income potential and quality of life.\nAgarwal said the evolving buyer base in 2026 includes affluent end-users and dual-income families seeking wellness-oriented environments, professionals prioritising work-life balance and community living, NRIs and investors focused on sustainability and branded housing promising capital preservation.\n“Compared to a few years ago, buyers are now as concerned about where they live and how they live as much as what they pay,” she said.",

        "full_content": "Milkfood Ltd., one of India’s listed dairy companies, has monetised a key real estate asset in Uttar Pradesh by selling its Moradabad manufacturing unit for Rs 130 crore.\nThe company informed stock exchanges that it has signed an ‘agreement to sell’ its dairy plant located at Agwanpur in Moradabad, marking a decisive step in its ongoing business reorganisation and deleveraging strategy. The transaction has resulted in a net cash inflow of Rs 116.11 crore after taxes, the company said.\nThe sale has generated a net profit of Rs 78.04 crore on land, underscoring the value of industrial real estate assets in the region. Milkfood reported no loss on the sale of plant and machinery and recorded a profit of Rs 7.54 crore on buildings. A reversal of Rs 37.37 crore from revaluation reserves was disclosed as a non-cash accounting adjustment, the company said.\nThe company said that a significant portion of the proceeds would be used to repay debt. Milkfood plans to repay loans worth Rs 75 crore, a move expected to reduce annual finance costs by around Rs 9.25 crore.\nThe company will also benefit from savings of nearly Rs 8.5 crore a year in plant-related overheads, taking the combined annual benefit to about Rs 17.75 crore, the firm said.\nThese measures are expected to lead to an earnings accretion of approximately Rs 7.25 per share (face value Rs 5), reflecting the immediate financial upside of the asset sale, the company said.\n“This transaction reflects a disciplined approach to capital allocation. By monetising a non-core asset, we are meaningfully reducing debt, improving cash flows and creating financial headroom to pursue growth opportunities,” said Sudhir Avasthi, Managing Director, Milkfood Ltd.\nThe company plans to invest in new capacities, including ice-cream manufacturing, while also evaluating expansion opportunities in cheese and butter segments, which continue to see strong demand in urban and semi-urban markets, the firm said.\nOperationally, Milkfood intends to scale up production at its Patiala facility. The company estimates that turnover could reach Rs 750 crore by FY27, with EBITDA margins of around 7 percent.\nIndustry watchers see the Moradabad asset sale as part of a wider trend of companies unlocking value from industrial land and manufacturing real estate to strengthen balance sheets and fund growth.",

        "full_content": "As India gears up for the Union Budget 2026, the real estate sector once again finds itself at the crossroads, linking\npolicy, capital, and long-term urban transformation. The sector is rarely the loudest sector in fiscal debates, yet it remains one of the most deeply intertwined with how the economy functions and how cities take shape.  In that sense, real estate is less a standalone industry and more a connective tissue linking policy intent with lived reality.\nDemand has showed surprising resilience\nOver the past two years, the sector has shown a degree of resilience that few anticipated in the aftermath of global uncertainty and domestic recalibration.\nDemand has held steady across housing segments, with premium and luxury markets continuing to find depth among buyers who value stability, quality, and long-term asset security.\nMaturing ecosystem has helped\nThis sustained momentum has not been accidental. It reflects a period of regulatory maturity, improved governance, and a cautious rebuilding of trust between developers and homebuyers. The forthcoming budget therefore presents an opportunity to reinforce stability, improve affordability, and sustain the growth trajectory that the sector has carefully built over the past few years.\nSustaining housing and urban development\nAt the centre of industry expectations lies continuity. Long-term housing and urban development programmes work best when predictable, allowing developers, investors, and state agencies to plan with clarity. Consistency in flagship initiatives related to housing, infrastructure, and urban rejuvenation supports better project planning and steady employment across construction and allied industries.\nReal estate’s multiplier effect—spanning cement, steel, logistics, interiors, and services—means sustained government backing has a ripple impact beyond the sector. A budget that reinforces continuity in these programmes would help maintain execution momentum and contribute to organised urban expansion.\nInfrastructure-equivalent status will unlock patient capital\nGranting housing “infrastructure-equivalent” status, along with tax rebates and incentives, would improve access to patient, long-tenure capital at lower financing costs. A stable policy framework would further enable developers, customers, and investors to structure funding and commit capital with confidence over the long term.\nEnhancing affordability through market-aligned incentives\nAffordability, however, remains the most delicate lever. Budgetary measures that enhance home-buying benefits, whether through interest-linked incentives or tax-related support, can meaningfully improve buyer confidence.\nImportantly, aligning housing incentives with current market realities would ensure that policy benefits remain relevant to today’s homebuyers rather than being constrained by outdated benchmarks. Such alignment can help bridge the gap between aspiration and access, particularly for first-time buyers.\nFurthermore, revision of affordable housing price capped at Rs 45 lakh is another key area that demands attention. Urban land and construction costs have evolved significantly over the past decade, and revisiting price thresholds to reflect present-day realities would allow more genuine end-users to qualify for benefits. For developers, this could encourage fresh project launches within the affordable and mid-income segments, improving supply where demand is structurally strong. A more contemporary definition of affordability would therefore support both homeownership and housing creation.\nGST rationalisation to ease cost pressures\nTaxation, particularly around construction inputs, continues to shape project viability in subtle but significant ways. Streamlining GST on construction-related items can help reduce cost pressures across the value chain, improve developer cash flows, and support timely project delivery. Over time, these efficiencies can lead to more competitive pricing for buyers while strengthening the financial health of projects. A simpler, more balanced tax framework would reinforce the sector’s ability to deliver at scale without compromising on quality or timelines.\nA budget that builds for the future\nWhat distinguishes the real estate sector today from its earlier cycles is its growing institutional character. Regulatory oversight has improved transparency, technology has reshaped transactions, and buyers are more informed than ever. From RERA-compliant disclosures to digital transaction platforms, the industry has embraced transformation. The upcoming budget can strengthen this evolution with progressive policy measures that focus on affordability, rationalisation and stability, while recognizing evolved market conditions and staying true to the vision of housing for all.\n(Vijay Wadhwa, Chairman, The Wadhwa Group.)\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

In commercial property terms, a 'warm shell' property indicates that it has basic requirements in place, such as air conditioning, some electrical fittings, completed floors and ceilings, and lighting.\nL&T Realty said in a statement that the property will include a single tower, with 28 office floors, a ground floor, basement, and six podium floors. The offices are expected to have floor plates of around 14,000 square feet each.\nThe Lower Parel-Prabhadevi belt is one of the most sought-after markets for major corporates, large, strategic facilities, including their headquarters, especially for the banking, financial services, insurance (BFSI) sector, players in the manufacturing and pharmaceutical segments, as well as for professional services networks and major law firms.\nOffice rentals have significantly increased over the past two years due to a persistent shortage, with monthly rentals for Grade-A office spaces trading at more than Rs 250 per square foot.\nThe company, which is headed for a public listing over the next two years, said that it is aiming for the corporate and BFSI sectors in the new tower, with the location also seeing major infrastructure development to improve access.\n\"The L&T Realty Innovation Campus at Lower Parel has been envisioned as a future-ready workplace. Tapping into the BFSI micro-market of Lower Parel in the financial capital of the country, this development enjoys a central position with strong corporate presence, unparalleled connectivity, robust social infrastructure, and ease of access to premium residential catchments,\" said Anupam Kumar, CEO and managing director, L&T Realty.\nAnupam added that the property has a construction timeline of around 36 months, and has the potential to bring in significant annuity income for the company.",

        "full_content": "After sharp price gains across top cities for the past two years, India’s residential property market is entering 2026 with prices expected to stabilise, though the risk of a slowdown in select markets remains.\nHome prices rose at their fastest pace in years through 2025 because of strong end-user demand, tight inventory in prime micro-markets, rising construction and land costs, and sustained appetite for premium and luxury housing.\nIndustry experts said 2026 is unlikely to see a repeat of last year’s sharp price escalation. Instead, the market is expected to transition into a phase of calibrated growth, with pricing becoming increasingly micro-market and segment specific.\nThey said property price growth is expected to moderate after sharp gains across major cities such as Noida, Gurugram, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune in previous years.\nResidential sales, which rebounded sharply after the pandemic, have moderated in recent quarters alongside a weaker domestic equity market. Real estate developer Signature Global (India) Ltd earlier this month said it might not meet its sales guidance for the current fiscal, citing softer demand conditions.\nAnalysts said that the slowdown is expected to extend to other listed developers as well. Nomura Securities projects a 92 percent fall in DLF’s pre-sales and a 43 percent decline for Oberoi Realty. Analysts said that housing demand in Gurugram and Noida could soften amid elevated prices and a slowdown in new project launches.\nFrom momentum to moderation\nAccording to the CREDAI-CREMatrix Developer Sentiment Survey 2026, most developers expect residential prices to either stabilise or grow at a slower pace this year, with demand holding firm but becoming more value-conscious. The survey also points towards a moderation in property price hikes rather than more cautious buyer behaviour.\n“The market has absorbed a lot of price increase over the last 18–24 months. In 2026, buyers are more discerning. They are still willing to pay a premium—but only for the right location, connectivity and product quality. We are clearly seeing a shift from aggressive pricing to strategic pricing,” said Sandeep Chhillar, Founder & Chairman, Landmark Group.\nCity-wise divergence emerging\nCity wise trends point to divergence rather than a uniform slowdown. Market observers said that Delhi-NCR remains one of the strongest markets, driven by infrastructure projects such as the Dwarka Expressway, Noida International Airport and metro expansions.\nHowever, affordability pressures are beginning to temper demand in peripheral micro-markets where prices have risen faster than income growth.\nSehaj Chawla, Managing Director, TREVOC Group said that demand remains resilient in well-connected corridors where infrastructure delivery is clearly visible.\n“Across NCR and other metros, price appreciation in 2026 is expected to become more calibrated. Projects at well-connected locations will attract greater traction,” he added.\nMumbai continues to see resilience in premium and redevelopment-led supply, though mid-segment buyers are increasingly price-sensitive. Experts said that Bengaluru and Hyderabad are witnessing steady absorption, supported by technology-sector employment, but price growth is expected to moderate as new supply comes on stream. Pune and Chennai are likely to remain end-user-driven, with limited speculative activity, they said.\nDevelopers recalibrate strategies\nMarket observers said that developers are recalibrating strategies in 2026 due to slow momentum.\nAmit Modi, Director, County Group, said that affordability has become a key conversation again, so instead of chasing headline price hikes, developers are focusing on optimising unit sizes, introducing flexible payment plans, and phasing launches to align with demand absorption.\n“Developers are responding by fine-tuning product mix, more efficient homes, fewer speculative launches, and sharper pricing discipline. The objective is volume-led growth rather than aggressive appreciation,” he added.\nCREDAI-CRE Matrix survey echoes this trend, indicating that developers are prioritising execution and cash-flow visibility over rapid expansion. New launches are increasingly concentrated in established micro-markets with proven demand rather than peripheral locations.\nStability over slowdown\nIndustry watchers anticipate that 2026 will test the market’s ability to sustain demand without relying solely on price momentum. Interest rates are expected to remain largely stable, supporting housing demand, but affordability constraints will cap sharp upside.\nChawla of TREVOC Group said the next phase of growth would be driven less by speculation and more by fundamentals. “Markets with infrastructure, employment visibility and quality supply will continue to perform,” he said.",

        "full_content": "Ahead of the Union Budget, real estate stakeholders have called for tax reforms and greater government funding, particularly through the expansion of Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing (SWAMIH) Fund.\nTargeted fiscal measures are critical to sustaining housing demand, reviving stalled projects and aligning policy with current market realities, industry leaders have said.\nIndustry body the National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO) has stressed for the need for deeper financial support to unlock real estate-led growth through schemes such as SWAMIH Fund.\nIndustry stakeholders also highlighted the need to increase the home loan interest deduction limit from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. Additional interest subsidies and reduction in GST would provide a much-needed boost to affordable housing, they said.\nSWAMIH Fund expansion\nLaunched in 2019 with an initial corpus of Rs 25,000 crore, the SWAMIH Fund was created to provide last-mile financing to stalled residential projects and protect homebuyers stuck in delayed developments.\nSince inception, SWAMIH Fund-I has sanctioned investments in over 130 stalled projects across India, helping revive nearly one lakh housing units, according to government disclosures. Of these, tens of thousands of homes have already been completed and delivered in stressed markets such as NCR, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune.\n“We urge the government to accord infrastructure status to the real estate sector, extend and expand the SWAMIH Fund, improve credit access for developers, rationalise GST on under-construction housing, and provide incentives for first-time homebuyers and rental housing,” NAREDCO president Parveen Jain.\nHe added that sustained investment in urban infrastructure and a sharper focus on tier 2 and 3 cities could significantly enhance demand, buyer confidence and the sector’s contribution to GDP and employment.\nTax reforms key to affordability and ‘Housing for All’\nTax policy reforms are another major expectation from the upcoming budget, especially as affordability pressures intensify in urban markets.\nAnita Basrur, Partner at Sudit K Parekh and Co. LLP, said the government’s “Housing for All” vision under schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) requires urgent recalibration of tax thresholds.\n“With inflation, land prices and construction costs rising, the current affordable housing cap of Rs 45 lakh and size limits of 60–90 square metres no longer reflect urban realities,” Basrur said.\nShe called for reducing GST on housing projects, increasing the home loan interest deduction limit from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, and offering interest subsidies for first-time buyers.\nBasrur also suggested enhancing capital gains reinvestment limits and streamlining approvals through a single-window clearance mechanism to boost the sector.\nPolicy Push\nDevelopers, particularly in the premium and branded housing segments, are seeking consistency in taxation and improved access to institutional financing to sustain investor confidence.\n“The real estate sector eagerly anticipates policies that bolster long-term capital formation and reinforce housing’s pivotal role in economic growth,” said Anil Mittal, chief financial officer, Smartworld Developers.\nContinued investment in urban infrastructure, mass mobility and integrated city planning is critical, as improved connectivity and civic amenities directly enhance the appeal of residential developments.\nIndia Sotheby’s International Realty managing director Amit Goyal said for the housing momentum to sustain, buoyancy in the equity markets and foreign capital inflows must remain buoyant. “It is imperative for the budget to announce measures that will encourage more FDI (foreign direct investments) into the country,” he said.\nManish Agarwal, Managing Director (Satya Group) and President, CREDAI Haryana, said that as the Budget approaches, developers urge the government to introduce forward-looking policy interventions that pair exclusivity with financial agility.\n\"In particular, incentivising fractional ownership could be a gamechanger for the marquee asset class. By aligning fiscal policy with these evolving market dynamics, India can move beyond property development to build a resilient, world-class luxury ecosystem that competes effectively on the global stage,\" he said.",

        "full_content": "India’s subdued equity markets and volatile investor sentiment are beginning to weigh on the country’s real estate sector, particularly in the mid-income and premium-housing segments, as developers report slower sales momentum and cautious buyer behaviour.\nAfter a strong post-pandemic recovery, residential sales have shown signs of moderation in recent quarters, mirroring the lacklustre performance of domestic stock markets. Market observers say prolonged volatility in equities, limited wealth creation and a wait-and-watch approach among investors have dampened discretionary property purchases, especially from high-value and investor-driven segments.\nThe impact is becoming visible in developer guidance. Signature Global (India) Ltd, a key player in the mid-income and premium housing segment, earlier this month indicated that it might not be able to meet its sales guidance for the current fiscal, citing softer demand conditions.\nAnalysts have viewed the company’s commentary as an early signal of broader stress in parts of the residential market. They say housing demand in Gurugram could soften amid elevated prices and a slowdown in new project launches.\nThe trend is not limited to Signature Global as other major listed developers such as DLF and Oberoi Realty, are also expected to report weaker pre-sales. Nomura Securities, in its latest note, projects a steep 92 percent drop in pre-sales for DLF, while Oberoi Realty is estimated to see a 43 percent decline.\n“Real estate demand in urban markets is closely linked to financial market sentiment. When equity markets underperform or remain range-bound, buyers tend to defer large-ticket purchases like homes,” a Delhi-NCR-based real estate consultant said on condition of anonymity.\nNuvama Institutional Equities said the frenzy that has characterised the Gurugram market over the past few years is now ebbing. The brokerage expects a rationalisation in new launches, pre‑sales momentum and the pace of price appreciation in the city going forward.\nInvestor-led demand weakens\nIndustry experts note that while end-user demand remains relatively stable, especially in affordable housing, investor-led demand has weakened amid uncertain capital market returns. High interest rates, elevated property prices in key urban centres and muted income growth have further added to buyer caution.\n“Stock market performance plays a significant role in driving confidence, particularly among repeat buyers and investors. With limited upside in equities, capital allocation to real estate has slowed,” an analyst with a real estate advisory firm said.\nThe slowdown is more pronounced in markets such as Gurugram where prices have risen sharply over the past two to three years, making affordability a growing concern. Developers are increasingly relying on festive offers, flexible payment plans and selective price corrections to sustain sales velocity.\nHowever, the impact has not been uniform across the sector. Prime housing in select micro-markets and well-located affordable projects continues to see steady traction, driven by genuine end-users. Commercial real estate, particularly office leasing, has also remained resilient, offering some cushion to developers with diversified portfolios.\nWill property prices go down?\nMarket observers said immediate outright price cut would not be happening, however, builders might start recalibrating their strategies to align with current demand realities.\n“Outright price cuts remain unlikely as elevated construction and land costs limit the scope for base price reductions. Instead, developers are relying on payment flexibility, limited-period incentives, and stamp-duty support to help buyer conversions,” said, Ashish Narain Agarwal, Founder and MD of PropertyPistol, a Mumbai-based real estate consultancy firm.\nHe said in more affordability-stretched micro-markets, launches are being deferred and sales targets moderated by developers as part of their strategies to tackle the situation.\n“Many developers are focusing on phased launches and sell-through efficiency, rather than chasing volumes,” Agarwal said.\nOutlook\nIndustry stakeholders believe that a revival in equity markets, coupled with softer interest rates and policy support, will be crucial to restoring buyer confidence. Until then, developers may need to recalibrate growth expectations and focus on execution and balance-sheet strength rather than aggressive sales targets.",

        "full_content": "Gurugram emerged as one of India’s biggest magnets for real estate investment in 2025, with projects worth Rs 86,588 crore receiving regulatory approvals during the year, according to Gurugram Real Estate Regulatory Authority (Gurugram RERA).\nMarket observers said that these estimates underscore strong investor appetite for the NCR’s largest commercial and residential hub.\nData released by the Gurugram RERA shows that 131 projects were registered in calendar year 2025, translating into development potential of 35,455 units across housing and commercial segments.\nNotably, just 28 large projects accounted for investments of Rs 59,360 crore, highlighting the growing role of big-ticket capital and large developers in shaping the city’s real estate landscape, the Authority data showed.\nData showed that the residential assets continued to attract the bulk of investments. Of the total units approved, 31,455 were residential, reflecting sustained end-user demand as well as investor confidence in Gurugram’s long-term housing fundamentals.\n“The residential mix was spread across categories, with 17,405 group housing units, 5,720 mixed land use units, 4,040 residential floor units, 2,122 affordable group housing units, 1,954 units under the Deen Dayal housing scheme, and 214 residential plotted colony units,” the Authority data showed.\nMarket observers said this diversified pipeline indicates that capital is being deployed across both premium and mass segments, reducing concentration risk and improving the depth of the market.\nAuthority officials said that of the 4,000 commercial units approved during the year, 168 units were dedicated to IT parks, reinforcing Gurugram’s status as a preferred destination for technology firms and Global Capability Centres.\nAnalysts said the combination of office-led employment growth and residential development continues to make Gurugram attractive for long-term capital deployment.\nIndustry experts said that the scale of investments approved in 2025 reflects Gurugram’s ability to attract capital even amid global uncertainty, driven by infrastructure expansion, strong corporate presence, and a more robust regulatory framework.\n“With a large pipeline of approved projects and continued interest from developers and institutional investors, Gurugram is expected to remain a key investment destination within India’s real estate market in the coming years,” a Gurugram-based real estate expert said.\nTighter regulatory checks\nAuthority officials said that alongside rising investment volumes, Gurugram RERA implemented tighter regulatory checks to improve transparency and protect investor and homebuyer interests.\n“These steps included enhanced scrutiny of developer submissions, mandatory site inspections by domain experts, and the introduction of public consultation through mandatory public notices before project registration,” an official said.\nAmlan Dutta, VP Sales and Strategy, Trehan Iris, said, that Gurugram’s clearance of 131 projects in 2025 marks a remarkable momentum for the sector, reflecting strong investor confidence and a renewed sense of market optimism.\n“RERA’s transparent and well-structured framework has played a pivotal role in driving this growth by empowering developers with greater planning certainty, smoother access to capital and the confidence to deliver high-quality projects on time. By promoting accountability and minimizing ambiguity, RERA safeguards buyer interests while simultaneously enhancing developer credibility,” he said.\nSudeep Bhatt, Director Strategy, Whiteland Corporation, said that regulatory reforms under RERA have been a key stimulus, bringing in greater transparency through strict compliance norms, mandatory site inspections and continuous project monitoring.\n“This has strengthened trust among HNIs and NRIs, leading to growing NRI participation and rising Indian global clout in real estate investments,” he said.",

        "full_content": "In 2025, India’s real estate market will be remembered for extremes. Luxury apartments are selling fast, premium prices are easily absorbed, and developers’ balance sheets are stronger than ever. However, beneath this success lies a troubling contradiction: affordable housing—the backbone of urban India—is quietly disappearing. This isn’t a demand crisis but a crisis rooted in economics, policy design, and misaligned incentives.\nA Vanishing Segment\nRecent market data paints a stark picture. Knight Frank India reports that the supply-to-demand ratio for homes priced below ₹50 lakhs has collapsed to 0.36 in the first half of 2025, down from a balanced 1.05 in 2019. In simpler terms, for every 100 affordable homes demanded, only 36 are being supplied.\nThe shift in developer focus is dramatic. Affordable housing accounted for over half of new residential launches in 2018; today, it represents just 17%. Sales in this segment have dropped nearly 17% year-on-year, even as luxury housing records its fastest-ever absorption rates. The paradox is evident: premium projects are selling quickly, yet unsold high-ticket inventory piles up. Meanwhile, lower- and middle-income households find homeownership increasingly unattainable. The market is oversupplying where demand is limited and undersupplying where it is structurally deep.\nWhy Developers Are Walking Away\nThe lack of affordable housing supply isn’t due to a lack of intent by developers. It’s primarily driven by razor-thin margins and unviable economics. Rising construction costs—cement, steel, labour, compliance, and most notably, urban land prices—have outpaced the growth of lower-income household incomes. Affordable housing, by definition, operates on tight margins, whereas luxury housing doesn’t.\nFor developers, the decision is clear: premium projects offer larger margins and pricing flexibility. In contrast, even small cost increases in affordable housing can wipe out profitability. Geography further complicates matters. Affordable land is usually available on city peripheries, but these areas often lack sufficient transport, social infrastructure, and employment opportunities. Consequently, developers find it difficult to make projects financially viable—either land in the city is too expensive, or peripheral areas are too disconnected.\nThe Illusion of Affordability\nThere’s a growing narrative that housing affordability has improved. Mumbai’s EMI-to-income ratio, for example, has dropped below 50%, now sitting at around 47%. This decline is attributed to lower interest rates and stable income growth. But this statistic hides the true barrier to homeownership for lower-middle-income households. The real challenge isn’t just the monthly EMI but the high upfront costs—down payments, stamp duty, registration charges, and rising property prices—making homeownership increasingly out of reach.\nMoreover, a significant portion of the affordable housing target audience is self-employed or earns informal income. Traditional banking requirements, such as salary slips, formal credit histories, and tax returns, exclude many genuine buyers from institutional financing. So, while demand exists, access does not.\nThe Policy Mismatch\nAt the heart of the issue lies a disconnect between policy intentions and market realities. The government’s commitment to “Housing for All” remains clear, and initiatives such as PMAY 2.0 reflect that vision. However, the frameworks governing taxation and incentives have not evolved to match rising costs.\nTake the current GST regime: residential housing is split into two categories—“affordable” projects taxed at 1% and all others taxed at 5%. To qualify as affordable, a home must cost less than ₹45 lakhs and meet strict size limits. These thresholds were set in 2017, and in 2026, they are outdated. Industry bodies, such as CREDAI, have proposed raising the affordability threshold to ₹90 lakhs, which would reflect current land and construction costs. Additionally, the legal definition of “affordable” should reflect the distinct price and cost dynamics between rural and urban areas.\nThe Hidden Tax Burden\nA major issue within the existing framework is that residential real estate developers cannot claim input tax credits, unlike other industries. Although GST on cement and tiles has been reduced, developers can’t offset these taxes against the GST collected from buyers. As a result, the 1% tax rate on affordable housing doesn’t account for input taxes embedded in construction costs, leading to a cascading tax effect. This hidden tax burden inflates prices, undermining the very goal of affordable housing. Allowing input tax credits for affordable projects or reducing GST on works contracts would directly reduce construction costs and make housing more affordable.\nThe Case for Direct Tax Incentives\nTo level the playing field, income tax incentives are essential. The reintroduction of Section 80-IBA of the Income Tax Act, which previously offered a 100% tax holiday on profits from affordable housing projects, could boost supply once again. However, the section had limitations, including a project life cap of five years, which is too short for the nature of the industry.\nTo revitalise affordable housing, Section 80-IBA could be revamped by:\nAdditionally, the ₹2 lakh cap on home loan interest deductions has become outdated. Raising this cap to ₹5 lakhs would offer immediate relief to families struggling with high EMIs.\nFurther, employers could be incentivised to build industrial and employee housing through higher depreciation allowances on employee residences. This would address migrant housing shortages while reducing pressure on urban slums.\nThe Role of States and Cities\nState governments and local authorities hold significant power to promote affordable housing through stamp duty and registration charge reductions. Currently, these high charges act as an additional burden on lower- and middle-income households. By reducing these rates for affordable housing projects, immediate relief could be provided.\nA responsive regulatory environment that speeds up approvals and reduces red tape can also make projects more viable. Urban development policy should align private and public interests, for example, by offering higher Floor Space Index (FSI) in prime locations for affordable housing projects.\nLooking Beyond Housing\nAffordable housing can’t be solved in isolation. Urban congestion, job concentration, and land scarcity are interconnected challenges. Long-term strategies must include economic decentralisation, satellite city development, and employment-linked housing incentives.\nConclusion\nLand is finite, and housing demand is perpetual. The affordable housing crisis is not inevitable. It’s a result of outdated definitions, mismatched policies, and tax distortions. By recalibrating what “affordable” truly means in 2026 and addressing the fiscal paradox developers face, India can restore balance to its housing market. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of “Housing for All” can once again become a reality, both socially and commercially, with the right structural reforms.\n(Deepesh Chheda is Partner, Dhruva Advisors.)\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "Noida, once known for offering affordable housing for the salaried middle class in the National Capital Region (NCR), is now becoming a hub for high-end residential developments, including branded residences by top hospitality, lifestyle and luxury brands.\nDriven by expanding job opportunities, infrastructure growth, rising wealth, and evolving buyer aspirations, the city is swiftly developing into a luxury and branded-residence destination, attracting high-net-worth individuals (HNIs), non-resident Indians (NRIs) and entrepreneurial buyers who once focused primarily on Mumbai, Delhi and Gurugram.\nBranded residences take centre stage\nNoida has seen a string of branded residences by Gulshan Group, M3M India and Smartworld Developers. In October 2025, M3M India collaborated with global luxury jewellery and watches brand Jacob & Co. to launch M3M-Jacob & Co Residences.\nSimilarly, in December, the Indian Hotels Company Ltd (IHCL), the owner of Taj Hotels, has collaborated with Noida-based realty firm Gulshan Group to develop a Taj hotel and Taj Branded Serviced Apartments in Noida’s Sector 129 along the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway.\nAlso Read: From Trump Towers to Jacob & Co, branded residences lead India’s luxury housing wave\nJoining the league of branded residences, Smartworld Developers has collaborated with Lebanon-based fashion designer and lifestyle brand, Elie Saab, for another branded residence project in Sector 98 in Noida. Besides these, M3M India is also planning to launch Trump-branded residences in Noida.\nThe apartments in these branded residences in Noida typically range from Rs 9 crore to Rs 25 crore, depending on their size, location, and the brand.\nWho are the buyers?\nMarket observers said that these high-end property launches mark a departure from Noida’s traditional product mix, where housing was largely driven by mid-income segments. Developers are now focusing on differentiated offerings tailored to luxury, lifestyle and brand-conscious buyers.\nDevelopers and market analysts said that the primary buyers of Noida’s luxury and branded residences include HNIs, NRIs, corporates, entrepreneurs from tier-1 and 2 cities, and some celebrities.\nYukti Nagpal, Director, Gulshan Group, said that buyers of high-end apartments are CXO-level professionals, entrepreneurs, and NRIs seeking space, comfort, and long-term value.\n“Compared to Mumbai, Delhi, or Gurugram, Noida still offers larger homes and better value, which is increasingly influencing premium homebuyer decisions,” she said.\nPankaj Bansal, the owner of M3M India and founder of Smartworld Developers, said buyers are largely people who have arrived in their lives and want their presence to be felt.\n“Either these people have a lot of money, or they are famous in the area they operate. The second category is the wealthy people who want to move from tier-2 cities to tier-1 cities. They want their second generation to live in tier-1 cities. The third ones are the CEOs and CFOs of large multinational companies,” he said.\nVishal Raheja, Founder and Managing Director, InvestoXpert Advisors, said that investment motivation plays an equally strong role in the purchase of such properties.\n\"NRIs and strategic investors are also actively acquiring premium residences driven by strong capital appreciation potential, attractive rental yields in prime business corridors, and limited high-quality inventory that ensures sustained resale value,” he said.\nRaheja added that an emerging segment of younger, affluent professionals and dual-income households in tech, finance, and services also prefer to buy branded properties as they seek exclusivity, security, wellness and globally benchmarked amenities.\nKey factors driving growth of luxury or branded residences\nAshish Narain Agarwal, the founder and Managing Director of PropertyPistol, a real estate consultant, said that infrastructure development, strategic urban planning, expanding expressways, metro connectivity, and proximity to the upcoming Noida International Airport are fueling Noida’s transformation.\nAlso Read: M3M–Jacob & Co branded 5BHK residences sell out at Rs 40,000 per sq ft in Noida — highest-ever rate for the city\nStrong corporate growth driven by IT parks, industrial corridors, and global capability centres (GCC) has created a high-income working population seeking premium lifestyle housing.\n“Alongside this, growing demand for modern amenities, wellness-led environments, security, and branded living experiences has encouraged developers to introduce world-class luxury offerings. As a result, Noida is evolving from a functional residential zone into a sophisticated luxury destination offering global-standard living, lifestyle convenience, and strong investment prospects,” he said.\nRavi Nirwal, Principal Partner and Sales Director, Square Yards, said that the availability of large, contiguous land parcels in Noida has allowed developers to plan integrated, low-density projects with premium amenities, which is often difficult in more saturated markets.\nComparison of Noida with Mumbai, Delhi, and Gurugram\nRaheja of InvestoXperts said that Noida today stands out as one of India’s most competitive premium real estate destinations, offering a balance of affordability, lifestyle excellence, and future-ready infrastructure.\nAccording to data from InvestoXpert, property prices in Noida typically range between Rs 9,000 – Rs 15,000 per sqft, with ultra-luxury developments oscillating between Rs 15,000 – Rs 40,000 per sq ft, compared with Delhi-NCR’s regional luxury average of Rs 23,000 per sq ft.\nAverage pricing in Gurugram ranges between Rs 20,000 and Rs 37,000 per sq ft in premium corridors, while Mumbai’s average pricing is significantly higher, from Rs 40,000 per sq ft to over Rs 100,000 in marquee micro-markets.\nUnlike Mumbai, where ultra luxury is often defined by scarcity and location, or central Delhi, where legacy and exclusivity play a major role, Noida’s premium offerings are more focused on scale, modern infrastructure and planned development, said Nirwal of Square Yards.\n“When compared to Gurugram, which has a more mature luxury ecosystem and proximity to corporate headquarters, Noida is emerging as an alternative for buyers prioritising newer infrastructure and comparatively competitive pricing,” he said.",

        "full_content": "As the Union Budget 2026 draws near, India’s real estate sector has urged the government to grant the sector an industry status, digitise land records and introduce a simplified single-window clearance mechanism to accelerate approvals and revive demand.\nIndustry bodies and developers argue that recognising real estate as an “industry” would unlock cheaper long-term institutional credit, lower borrowing costs and broader access to structured financing.\nDevelopers said that industry status has been a long-pending demand and they remain optimistic, expecting sustained policy support in the budget.\n“The real estate sector currently contributes around 7 percent to India’s GDP and supports over 200 allied industries. Granting industry status to real estate sector would improve access to institutional funding and enable the sector to play a stronger role in job creation and economic growth. Real estate has the potential to contribute up to 15 percent to India’s GDP by 2047 with the help of adequate policy support,”  Signature Global (India) Ltd founder and chairman Pradeep Aggarwal has said.\nTribeca Developers group CEO Rajat Khandelwal said the sector is looking for policy continuity that supports both supply and demand. “Granting industry status to real estate remains crucial, as it would ease access to long-term capital; lower borrowing costs, and improve execution efficiency for developers,” he said.\nKhandelwal said real estate growth is closely tied to infrastructure. Increased investments in urban infrastructure, public transport and smart city initiatives will not only make cities liveable but also strengthen the realty sector.\nSterling Developers chairman and managing director Ramani Sastri said industry status will help the real estate sector realise its full potential, as it will unlock affordable funding and streamline regulatory processes.\n“Overall, we would like to see announcements to enhance ease of doing business for the developers to create positive climate for real estate investment,” he said.\nSingle-window clearance and digitisation of land records\nDevelopers have also sought single-window clearances, consolidating approvals from multiple authorities on a unified digital platform. It will cut the red tape, reduce project gestation periods and enhance transparency, they have argued.\nTRG Group MD Shorab Upadhyay said realtors are looking forward to a Union Budget that brings in stability, liquidity and confidence in the real estate sector.\n“We expect better policy support towards faster project approvals, single-window clearances, and digitisation of land records, which are much-needed steps in substantially enhancing ease of doing business and accelerating delivery timelines,” he said.\nNotandas Realty managing director  Harsh Jagwani said a single-window clearance system is “long overdue” and capable of accelerating approvals and injecting much-needed efficiency into project execution.\nThe government should also bring reforms in the digitisation process of land as well as property acquisition. “This will not only help in accelerating the pace of development of new projects but also ease the process of buying new homes for homebuyers in general. Cleaner land-title system, stricter escrow enforcement under RERA will also help reduce transaction risk and financing delays,” he said.",

        "full_content": "For thousands of homebuyers who have spent over a decade paying EMIs without possession, a long-awaited turning point may finally be in sight at Jaypee’s Wish Town in Noida.\nSuraksha Group, which took over debt-laden Jaypee Infratech Ltd (JIL) through the insolvency process in 2024, has completed construction of 5,989 residential units spread across 63 towers.\nThe company has secured Occupancy Certificates (OCs) for 3,135 units across 31 towers, clearing the way for possession and registrations to begin for a significant chunk of stranded buyers. Another 2,854 units across 32 towers are awaiting regulatory approvals, with the developer saying OCs are expected over the next few months.\nRelief for buyers stuck in limbo\nFor buyers who have been paying home loan EMIs without possession for years, the issuance of OCs is the first concrete sign that homes may finally be handed over.\n“Construction completion is important, but for us the real relief comes only when OCs are issued and possession starts,” said a homebuyer from the Kosmos project, who booked the apartment in 2012.\nJaypee Infratech was admitted to insolvency in 2017, leaving more than 20,000 homebuyers across its Noida and Greater Noida projects in limbo. After multiple failed resolution attempts, Suraksha Group took over the company in 2024, promising time-bound delivery under a court-approved resolution plan.\nAnother homebuyer and a representative of a Kensington Park homebuyers’ group said that they have seen promises earlier too, so buyers are cautiously optimistic.\n“Receiving OCs for 31 towers is a positive development, but the real test will be timely handover, completion of common facilities, and basic services like water and power,” he asserted.\nProjects cleared, more awaiting approvals\nThe towers that have received OCs are spread across projects including JP Kosmos, Klassic, Kensington Boulevard Apartments, and Kensington Park Apartments and Heights, covering 3,135 units.\nJash Panchamia, Executive Director at Jaypee Infratech Ltd, said that 63 towers have been completed and OCs have already been received for 31 towers. He said that the company expects OCs for another 32 towers over the next couple of months.\nHe said that construction on the remaining towers is progressing and deliveries would be aligned with timelines laid out under the resolution framework.\n“Despite crippling restrictions imposed on construction activities due to GRAP rules during winter months every year, we remain fully committed to fulfilling our customers’ expectations and delivering as per the resolution plan,” Panchamia said.\nBuyers, however, said that regulatory approvals are critical not only for possession but also for financial closure. “Without an OC, banks don’t allow us to complete registration, and we remain stuck paying EMIs and rent simultaneously. Even a few months’ delay has a real financial impact on families,” said a buyer from the Klassic project.",

        "full_content": "Banking giant JPMorgan's India arm has leased 2.7 lakh square feet of office space at Powai in Mumbai with a rental commitment of over Rs 600 crore in five years, according to documents accessed by real estate data analytics firm Propstack.\nJPMorgan has leased the space from COWORKS at One Downtown Central (CRISIL House). The building was earlier occupied by CRISIL, which taken up by COWRKS and then leased to JPMorgan. Market observers said that the latest deal is part of the company’s long-term GCC expansion plans.\nAccording to document, the lease will start from April 1, 2026, and the tenure of the lease is five years. The tenants will also have an option of renewing the lease after five years for another five years.\nThe monthly rent is Rs 9.23 crore and in five years the total rent will translate to Rs 612 crore after considering 5 percent yearly escalation in rentals, the documents showed.\nThe tenant paid a stamp duty and registration fee of Rs 7.28 crore for the transaction. The company also made a security deposit of Rs 55.38 crore. The deal was executed on Dec 29, 2025.\nThe deal includes ground and 3rd to 9th floor of the building with total leasable area of 2.71 lakh square feet and carpet area of 1.77 lakh square feet. Kairos Properties Private Limited owns the building, which is a part of Brookfield India Real Estate Trust.\nThere was no immediate response available from J Morgan and COWRKS towards queries sent by Moneycontrol. The copy will be updated after receiving a response.\nThe premises leased by JPMorgan is designed for total 2,381 seats, 257 meeting rooms.\nRaja Seetharaman, Cofounder of Propstack, said that the deal allows Brookfield to capture value across the entire lifecycle—refilling the vacated CRISIL space via COWRKS while securing a long-term development deal.\n“For JPMorgan, it’s a seamless expansion in Powai, bridging the gap between their immediate needs and the delivery of their massive 1.3 million sqft campus,” he said.\nEarlier in June 2025, JPMorgan has leased 1.16 lakh square feet of office space at an under-construction development by Japanese firm Sumitomo Realty and Development's India subsidiary Goisu Realty at Bandra Kurla Complex in Mumbai for a monthly rent of Rs 6.91 crore.\nPowai’s rise as an office destination\nMarket observers said that Powai’s proximity to key business corridors like Andheri, SEEPZ, Vikhroli and the Eastern Express Highway, along with improving social infrastructure, has made it attractive for BFSI, IT and global capability centres (GCCs).\nAnalysts said that the latest transaction underscores Powai’s growing stature as a preferred office hub for global financial services and technology firms, at a time when occupiers are increasingly seeking high-quality office spaces beyond Mumbai’s traditional business districts such as Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) and Nariman Point.\nJPMorgan’s leasing move comes amid a broader trend of global financial institutions expanding their India footprint driven by cost efficiencies, access to skilled talent and India’s growing role in global financial services operations.",

        "full_content": "Mumbai-based developers Shree Naman Group and Oberoi Realty have emerged as the top bidders for an 11 acre plot in Bandra (East), owned by the Indian Railways, according to sources from the Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA), which is conducting the bidding process. The land is slated to be handed over to the winning bidder for a lease period of 99 years.\nAccording to tender documents, the plot, wedged between the Western Railway tracks and the Western Express Highway, has a reserve price of Rs 5,365 crore. The area is also located near the Bandra Kurla Complex business district. Additionally, the winning bidder is expected to share at least 45 percent of revenue generated from the project. The plot carries a floor-space index (FSI)- indicating the developable area relative to the size of the plot- of 4.0.\nMoneycontrol has approached both Shree Naman Group and Oberoi Realty for comment on the matter, and the story will be updated once a response is received.\nPeople aware of the matter said that the developable area at the site is expected to be around 1.9-2 million square feet, with the existing FSI of the plot. The site is expected to be developed into a mixed-use property, with commercial and residential properties, as well as a small retail component integrated into the premises. They added that with the area's property prices and large land price component may help form the strategy for the winning bidder.\n\"The surrounding area does not have too much residential development, and the area's home prices trade at a discount compared to Bandra (West) or core Bandra Kurla Complex, at around Rs 60,000-65,000 per square foot. So the winning developer may either choose to develop the residential component entirely to sell the inventory and completely pay off the RLDA, or they may choose to build offices on part of the land, earn rental income, and pay the revenue share over time, despite an interest component. The economics of the development due to the large land cost needs to be worked on,\" said one of the people.\nAnother property market observer said that a commercial development may be beneficial to developers, due to the plot's proximity to the Bandra railway station, enabling easy access for employees. The new commercial supply may also attract more tenants, due to low vacancies at Bandra Kurla Complex.\nThe RLDA tender is one of multiple similar deals in Mumbai, with the railways being one of the largest land holders in the city. In December 2025, infrastructure firm Dineshchandra R Agarwal Infracon emerged as the highest bidder for a six acre plot at Supari Baug in Parel, also owned by the railways. The firm had bid Rs 1,368 crore for the plot.\nAdditional plots in Mumbai for sale, lease, or development by the RLDA includes areas such as Thane, Mahalaxmi, among other suburbs.",

        "full_content": "The Uttar Pradesh government’s revised township policy and broader real estate reforms are showing strong results, with capital investment in the sector rising sharply over the past year.\nAccording to a report released by the Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority, investments in the state’s real estate sector touched Rs 68,328 crore in 2025, up from Rs 44,526 crore in 2024. This represents an increase of about 53.5 percent. The authority said 309 projects were registered during the year, reflecting growing investor confidence in the state’s policy framework.\n“Pro-government policies, especially the revised township policy and faster regulatory clearances, have significantly improved ease of doing business in real estate. This is directly reflected in the sharp rise in investment and project registrations,” Indu Prakash Sharma, of Trio Vision Infra told this reporter.\nThe surge follows key amendments to the township policy, under which the minimum land requirement for developing townships was reduced from 25 acres to 12.5 acres. The revised policy also introduced stricter timelines for project completion to protect the interests of homebuyers. Under the new norms, townships spread over 25 acres must be completed within three years, while larger projects have a maximum completion period of five years.\nEarlier, several large projects had remained stalled for eight to twelve years, leading to buyers’ funds being locked up. Officials said the new provisions have brought relief to both investors and allottees by improving project viability and ensuring faster delivery.\nWhile the National Capital Region has traditionally dominated Uttar Pradesh’s real estate landscape, 2025 data indicates a clear shift towards non-NCR districts and smaller cities. Of the total projects registered during the year, 122 were in the NCR, while 186 were approved in non NCR areas.\nThe trend underlines the impact of infrastructure expansion, improved connectivity and focused development of tier two cities. Lucknow emerged as a major hub with 67 projects registered. Bareilly recorded 15 projects and Agra 14. New investments were also seen in Bulandshahar, Rampur, Chandauli, Unnao, Gonda, Mau and Mirzapur, pointing to a wider geographical spread of real estate activity across the state.\nReligious tourism has also played a significant role in driving real estate growth. Mathura saw 23 projects registered in 2025. Ayodhya recorded five projects, Varanasi nine and Prayagraj seven.\n“The large-scale redevelopment of Ayodhya, Varanasi and Mathura, along with a sharp rise in religious tourism, has created strong demand for housing, hospitality and commercial projects,” Vishal Singh, a government spokesman said. “These cities are no longer just pilgrimage destinations. They are fast emerging as new real estate growth centres.”\nReal estate developers say the broader improvement in the state’s investment climate has played a crucial role in changing perceptions about Uttar Pradesh.\n“Over the last few years, there is a very positive vibe about Uttar Pradesh. Earlier, many big investors were not willing to come here. Now you can see major names entering the state, whether it is large housing projects, logistics parks, industries or townships,” said Amit Srivastava, CEO of BBD Viraj Group and a member of CREDAI.\nHe pointed to infrastructure upgrades such as new expressways, including the Lucknow-Delhi connectivity, as well as improvements in electricity supply, law and order, and ease of doing business doing wonders to UP’s march to prosperity.\n“One of the most transformative decisions has been allowing land-use conversion through development authorities. Earlier, this process was with the Revenue Board and used to take a very long time, which was not business-friendly. Now approvals are faster, and that has unlocked a lot of stalled and new investments,” Srivastava said.\nOfficials said improved connectivity, urban redevelopment programmes and a steady rise in tourist and devotee footfall are helping these cities emerge as new centres of real estate development in Uttar Pradesh and hoped that the state will maintain strong momentum in the coming years.",

        "full_content": "Residential sales in 2025 declined by 1 percent in 2025, after four straight years of growth, amid concerns in the market about the real estate cycle turning negative over the past year. A report from Knight Frank India shows that 3,48,207 homes were sold across the top eight markets in India for the year, down from 3,50,612 units in 2024.\nExperts, however, noted that while the current sales figures have cast doubts among investors and observers about the sector's future, the situation remains steady, with no major upheaval expected soon. Sales in the affordable category continued to be weak, and sales momentum in premium and luxury segments continued to grow, as has been the trend since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"Even as sales are lower this year, the situation is not yet raising concern. Looking ahead, we do not see a sharp fall or decline in real estate sales,\" said Gulam Zia, senior executive director at Knight Frank India, addressing a press briefing.\nShishir Baijal, Knight Frank India's chairman and managing director, added that Grade-A developers, who cater to premium price points, continue to perform well. He added that the sluggishness of sales in the affordable category (priced less than Rs 50 lakh) may be related to the quality of the products on offer.\nThe National Capital Region saw a significant decline in sales- 9 percent- while sales in Mumbai, India's largest housing market, were largely flat, as was the case in Bengaluru.\nLaunches down\nData from Knight Frank India also noted that launch activity across the top eight markets declined by 3 percent to 3,62,184 units for the year. Unsold inventory also rose slightly during the year to 5,09,815 units. Home prices in all major markets grew during the year, despite the decline in sales, with prices in NCR growing by a significant 19 percent. In Mumbai, prices grew by a moderate 7 percent, while in Bengaluru and Hyderabad, homes were dearer by 12 percent and 13 percent respectively.\nLaunches in NCR were down 16 percent, while in Mumbai, it was down by 10 percent. Bengaluru and Chennai were the only major markets where residential launches rose, by 23 percent and 20 percent respectively.\nMarket observers said that the decline in launches may also be related to supply-side constraints, rather than demand issues.\n\"India’s residential project launches have declined year-on-year, driven largely by supply-side constraints rather than a demand slowdown. Developers are contending with elevated land and construction costs, a visible slowdown in equity funding, and stricter compliance norms for debt raising, all of which have tightened project feasibility and delayed new starts,\" said Pawan Agarwal, MD of NK Realtors, a large broker in eastern India.\nAlso slowing down projects are regulatory approval timelines, developers added, with many projects over the last year delayed due to a key Supreme Court case related to the Union government's remit over eco-sensitive zones.\n\"...Approvals in many cities are taking longer. This delays the pipeline even as demand is robust. This is temporary and current mismatch between high absorption and slower new supply will keep prices stable for the next 12–18 months,\" said Haresh Kishor, MD of KG Developers.\nHowever, the quarters-to-sell, defined as the time required to sell existing inventory at ongoing sales run rates with no new stock being added, remained constant at 5.8 quarters, signifying a largely healthy market, said Ankita Sood, national director of research at Knight Frank India.",

        "full_content": "With Budget 2026 less than a week away, the conversation around income-tax has shifted from big announcements to practical concerns. For many middle-class households, the focus is on whether the coming year will bring clarity, predictability and fewer compliance surprises, especially with a new income-tax law set to take effect from April 1.\nThe transition to the Income Tax Act, 2026, is already shaping expectations. One of the most visible changes under the new law is the move to a “tax year” system, which replaces the long-standing distinction between “previous year” and “assessment year”.\nReady for tax-year system?\nAligning the year of earning income with the year of reporting and assessment is intended to make compliance more intuitive, Anita Basrur, Partner at Sudit K Parekh & Co. LLP, said.\nRevised return forms will require more granular disclosures for deductions such as HRA, home loan interest and claims under Sections 80C and 80D, all of which will need to be reconciled with AIS and Form 26AS data, reflecting a sharper, data-led compliance framework, she said.\nAmong salaried taxpayers, expectations from the Budget remain modest but specific. Sakchi Jain, a chartered accountant (CA) said the middle class is in urgent need of meaningful relief rather than symbolic tweaks. She pointed to the standard deduction as an area where relief could be felt immediately, noting that the Rs 2 lakh cap on home loan interest has remained unchanged for years despite rising property prices.\nJain also highlighted capital gains taxation as a pain point, arguing that the current structure remains complex and in need of simplified holding periods and rationalised rates. On compliance, she questioned the logic of multiple TDS categories and rates, especially where transactions are already covered under GST.\nNew law worries\nConcerns around readiness for the new law are also growing. Isha Jaiswal, another CA, drew attention to the operational strain within the tax system, with over 5.49 lakh appeals pending before appellate authorities.\nShe said the challenge is not the new law but the lack of clarity around forms, filing procedures and implementation guidelines so close to the rollout date. Without adequate transition support, even honest taxpayers could slip into non-compliance unintentionally, Jaiswal said.\nRitika Nayyar, Partner at Singhania & Co, said, “The middle class is looking for realistic relief measures such as an increase in the basic exemption limit, widening of tax slabs and enhancement of the standard deduction. She added that reintroducing select deductions under the new tax regime could help improve disposable incomes, particularly at a time when the cost of living continues to rise.”\nMarket participants are also watching for clarity on capital market taxation. Kunal Savani, Partner at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, said taxpayers are expecting clearer guidance on the applicability of rebates under Section 87A to capital gains. Such clarity, he said, could ease tax burdens for investors and encourage broader participation in capital markets, which have seen steady growth in recent years.\nFor salaried taxpayers, however, the immediate focus remains on take-home pay. Alay Razvi, Managing Partner at Accord Juris, said expectations from Budget 2026 are centered on making the new tax regime more attractive through a higher standard deduction, rationalised slabs and a higher exemption threshold. While sweeping cuts appear unlikely, he said calibrated tweaks that improve net income without straining fiscal discipline could offer meaningful relief to inflation-hit households.",

        "full_content": "Gold and silver have for long been seen as havens when markets turn rough But for long-term investors, the choice between the two metals is not simple. Each carries its own risks, rewards and role in a portfolio.\nIn the past year, the precious metals have been on a record-breaking spree. Gold has risen about 92 percent, supported by steady investor demand and its role as a safe place for money. Silver has outperformed gold by a margin, surging around 236 percent, driven by both investment interest and rising industrial demand.\nGold generally performs well during market dips, geopolitical tensions and currency devaluation. Silver is more cyclical. Despite being a precious metal, nearly 50 percent of silver demand arises from industrial uses such as solar panels, electric vehicles, electronics, and semiconductors.\nGold is often called the ultimate store of value. Central banks hold it, and investors turn to it in times of crisis. Over decades, its price has moved steadily higher, though not always smoothly.\n\"Silver’s sharp rise is driven by a mix of structural and cyclical factors. On the structural side, demand from solar, electronics, EVs, and green energy remains strong, while mine supply and recycling growth are limited, keeping the market in deficit,\" Renisha Chainani, Head of Research, Augmont, said.\nThe recent pace of gains has also been fuelled by short covering and speculative flows, which makes near-term corrections likely. \"So, while volatility may increase and sharp pullbacks are possible, the broader demand shift suggests this is not just a short-lived rally but one that may consolidate before moving higher,\" Chainani said.\nWhat should investors do?\nFor many long-term investors, the answer is not one or the other. A mix can smooth returns and spread risk.\n\"For long-term investors, gold offers a better risk-reward balance due to its lower volatility, strong central bank demand, and proven role as a hedge against inflation, geopolitical risk, and currency debasement. Silver, while offering higher upside potential, comes with significantly higher volatility and is more sensitive to economic cycles,\" Chainani said.\nSatish Dondapati, Fund Manager, Kotak Mutual Fund, sai , “Gold is safer and more stable, so it suits conservative investors who want to protect their money over time.\" Its price does not move too sharply.\n\"Silver is riskier and suits aggressive investors because its prices are more volatile, but it can give higher returns when markets are strong,\" said Dondapati.\nIn simple terms, gold is for safety, while silver is for higher but risky returns. A balanced approach using both metals can optimise risk and return.",

The world’s largest cryptocurrency remained volatile, as it had touched $88,760 before taking the fall.\n\"Bitcoin is stabilising after successfully defending the $86,000 level, hinting at a near-term recovery. Fears around a possible US government shutdown led to a brief risk-off move, but the narrative is now improving as the dollar weakens to a four-month low, driving flows back into assets like Bitcoin and gold,\" said Akshat Siddhant, Lead Quant Analyst, Mudrex.\nAccording to Riya Sehgal, Research Analyst, Delta Exchange, BTC faces stiff resistance between $89,500 and $91,000, with support around $86,000. ETH mirrors this structure, capped near the $3,000–$3,050 zone, with key support at $2,800.\nOther crypto tokens were volatile too. ADA was up 1.43 percent, ETH 2.41 percent, XRP 1.36 percent, SOL 1.27 percent, while Tether traded flat. USDC declined 0.02 percent in the past 24 hours.\n\"ETH, BNB, SOL, TRX, DOGE & ADA are unable to break through local resistance, as the markets remain focused on Bitcoin.

Besides, World Liberty Financial and Story plunged by over 4%, followed by MYX Finance & Memecore by 3.43% and 2.46%,\" said CoinDCX research team.\nHere's how the price of cryptocurrencies has moved.\nWhy is bitcoin down?\n“Bitcoin trading around the $87,000–$88,000 zone reflects a market caught between technical pressure and structural support. Elevated derivatives activity, upcoming options expiry, and recent fund outflows have added near-term stress, while macro uncertainty and geopolitical concerns are keeping risk appetite restrained. That said, this phase looks more like a compression of volatility rather than a breakdown in market structure.\n\"Buying interest remains visible around key support levels, suggesting participants are selectively accumulating rather than exiting outright. While Bitcoin is on track for another soft monthly close, the absence of panic selling and steady demand during pullbacks points to consolidation rather than capitulation. As leverage resets and macro signals stabilise, Bitcoin’s ability to hold this zone will be critical in determining the next directional move,” said Avinash Shekhar, Co-Founder & CEO, Pi42.\nWhat’s happening in the crypto market?\nHere’s a rundown of the crypto market, according to WazirX founder Nischal Shetty and CoinDCX research team:",

Therefore, the will executed by your father is very much valid unless it is contested on some other grounds.\nThe Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, which came into force on September 9, 2005, amended the 1956 Act to grant daughters equal coparcenary rights to ancestral property, allowing them to be coparceners by birth just like sons.\nYour sisters can claim their share in the assets which your father had bequeathed in his will.

        "full_content": "As India prepares for Budget 2026, retirement planning has quietly and steadily moved higher on the list of priorities for both policymakers and savers. One area gaining increased attention is the taxation of annuities, which for many retirees remains a consistent, though modest, source of post-work income.\nWith about 160 million people aged 60 and older, India is home to the second-largest elderly population in the world. This number is likely to increase to 230 million in 2036, about 15% of the total population, according to government estimates. Add to this the fact that the average life expectancy in India has increased about 14 years between 1990 and 2025.\nThis vast ageing population underlines the burgeoning pension and annuity market in India. An annuity caters to the key dilemma of a pensioner, for a life-long pension at a steady, guaranteed rate and exposes the investors to a reinvestment rate risk, especially in a volatile interest rate scenario.\n“Annuities are the only solution, which provide complete protection from the perspective of living longer (i.e. outliving one’s corpus), by providing a regular flow of income throughout one’s lifetime.\nCurrently, an annuity is completely taxed in the hands of the customer. Hence, a tax break on annuity could further encourage Indians to opt for these instruments, providing the much-needed social security to many during their golden years. Further, this will help insurance companies invest in long-rated bonds and channelise long-term savings into capital-intensive sectors,” said Subhrajit Mukhopadhyay, Deputy CEO and ED, Edelweiss Life Insurance.\nIt is pertinent to note that India’s insurance sector has made steady progress, but penetration and coverage gaps remain significant, particularly in retirement planning and rural protection.\nTarun Chugh, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Bajaj Life Insurance, said, \"Aligning the tax treatment of insurance annuities with other pension instruments, such as taxing only the returns on annuity payouts and extending comparable deductions, would allow individuals to choose retirement products based on suitability rather than tax differences. Similarly, bringing parity in taxation between traditional and unit-linked life insurance policies can simplify the tax framework and encourage disciplined, long-term wealth creation alongside protection.\"\nWhile the Indian government has already implemented several progressive reforms in recent years to sustain domestic demand and support its growth trajectory, analysts say the upcoming budget now presents an opportunity to shift focus towards long-term household financial security, particularly by easing the tax burden on retirement income and encouraging wider adoption of pension and annuity products.\nAmong its key reforms are the introduction of GST 2.0. and allowance of 100% FDI in insurance. As a part of GST 2.0 reforms, the government announced 0% GST on individual insurance products, signalling that insurance is an essential instrument.\nMukhopadhyay said, “The GST 2.0 measure has provided a fillip to the insurance sector, as evidenced in the November and December growth numbers. 100% FDI has also bolstered the market sentiment and improved the outlook for the sector. In the upcoming Union Budget FY 2026 – 2027, we expect a continuation in government’s efforts to bring ease of business, boost capital inflow into the Indian economy, and further the agenda of Insurance for All 2047.”",

        "full_content": "As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, tax experts are urging the government to expand the scope of deductions under the new tax regime, with home loans, medical insurance, and other key deductions emerging as top priorities.\nMedical inflation continues to be one of the biggest challenges facing India’s healthcare system, projected at 11.5%–14%, among the highest in Asia. While measures such as the removal of GST on insurance premiums and allowing 100 percent FDI in insurance can improve affordability and sector resilience, rising medical costs continue to put pressure on Indian households.\nPrashant Mishra, founder and CEO, Agnam Advisors, said, \"Here is what I as an SEBI Registered Investment Advisor think government should focus on: Simplifying the new tax regime by integrating key deductions such as housing loan interest, medical insurance under Section 80D (raised to Rs 50,000 for self/family and Rs 1 lakh for seniors), and a potential 25% slab for Rs 30-50 lakh earners would ease compliance burdens and provide equitable relief amid rising living costs. These changes would empower families to allocate more towards productive investments rather than litigation-prone structures.\"\nAs the Union Budget 2026–27 approaches, there is an opportunity to strengthen healthcare affordability by increasing public health spending and sharpening the focus on prevention. \"Currently, public health expenditure in India remains below global benchmarks and even short of the National Health Policy target of 2.5% of GDP in 2025. Enhancing the budgetary outlay for public health would strengthen primary care networks, expand preventive services, and relieve financial stress on citizens,\" said Srikanth Kandikonda, Chief Financial Officer, ManipalCigna Health Insurance.\n\"At the same time, policy measures that encourage preventive healthcare can significantly lower long-term treatment costs. Industry reports indicate that preventive care reduces hospitalisations and improves health outcomes. Introducing separate and enhanced tax benefits for OPD services and preventive health screenings, beyond the current limits under Section 80D, would encourage wider adoption of preventive care,\" added Kandikonda. The sections can be added to the new tax regime to provide better support to senior citizens.\nEnhancing retirement savings deductions and incentives for green projects or AIFs in GIFT City aligns with sustainable, long-term strategies tailored for HNIs. \"Rationalising surcharges, extending tax-neutral LLP reorganisations, and clarifying TDS on partners remuneration would streamline family office operations, fostering smoother wealth transfers across generations. Family-centric boosts, like higher allowances for elderly and child care, address demographic shifts, unlocking productivity for working professionals,\" said Mishra.\nShubham Gupta, CFA and Co-founder of Growthvine Capital, said, “As we get closer to the 2026 Union Budget, the focus of both taxpayers and businesses is on developing a fairer, more simplified, and predictable new tax regime, which many believe will improve household consumption and savings.”\nWith the new regime now the default option, expectations are rising that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman may use this year’s Budget to better balance lower rates with meaningful incentives, aiming to boost home ownership, encourage insurance adoption, and strengthen household financial security.",

        "full_content": "As investors grapple with persistent global uncertainty ranging from geopolitical tensions to sticky inflation and volatile equity markets precious metals are once again finding a central place in portfolios. But instead of choosing between gold or silver, there is also another option of turning to a mix gold and silver fund of funds (FoFs) that invest in gold ETFs and silver ETFs, seeking a balance between stability and growth.\nThe logic behind these FoFs rests on the fundamentally different, yet complementary, roles that gold and silver play in a portfolio.\nGold for stability, silver for growth\nGold has long been viewed as a financial safe haven. It tends to perform well during equity market downturns, periods of geopolitical stress and phases of currency weakness. Over the past few years, gold prices have been supported by aggressive central bank buying, de-dollarisation trends and demand for portfolio protection. As a result, gold has delivered steady returns while cushioning portfolios during sharp equity drawdowns.\nSilver, by contrast, is far more cyclical. While it is also a precious metal, nearly 50 percent of silver demand comes from industrial uses, including solar panels, electric vehicles, electronics and semiconductors. This gives silver a stronger growth linkage to the global economic cycle and new-age technologies. When precious metals enter a bull phase, silver has historically outperformed gold but with significantly higher volatility.\nThis divergence is precisely what makes a combination of the two attractive.\nWhy gold and silver work better together\nData from Edelweiss Mutual Fund shows that a 50:50 allocation to gold and silver has historically delivered a smoother return profile than silver alone, while generating higher returns than gold-only exposure over longer periods.\nDuring equity market stress, gold tends to limit downside. Silver may underperform in such phases, but its long-term growth drivers help boost overall returns during recoveries and commodity upcycles. The combined allocation therefore helps investors avoid the extremes—neither being too defensive nor overly volatile.\nFor instance, while silver delivered very sharp gains in the last one year, it has also seen deeper interim corrections in weaker years. Gold, on the other hand, has shown lower drawdowns and more consistent performance. A blended gold-silver approach helps balance these cycles.\nFor instance, in calendar year (CY) 2014, gold delivered a negative return of 8 percent, while silver performed worse with a decline of 16 percent. Similarly, in 2021, gold posted a negative return of 4 percent compared with an 8 percent fall in silver.\nIn 2025, however, silver delivered an extraordinary return of 167 percent, far outperforming gold’s 75 percent gain.\nThe data shows that while silver can generate sharp gains, it has also experienced deeper corrections in the past.\nThe role of FoFs investing via ETFs\nGold and silver FoFs typically invest in gold ETFs and silver ETFs, rather than holding physical metals. This structure offers several advantages.\nFirst, ETFs closely track domestic spot prices of gold and silver, ensuring transparency and lower tracking error. Second, ETFs provide daily liquidity and eliminate concerns around storage, purity and insurance associated with physical metals. Third, FoFs add another layer of convenience by handling allocation and rebalancing between gold and silver internally.\nMost gold and silver FoFs aim to maintain an equal allocation between the two metals, with periodic rebalancing to manage deviations caused by price movements. This disciplined approach ensures that investors systematically book profits from outperforming assets and add to laggards—something most retail investors struggle to do on their own.\nOne of the biggest advantages of gold and silver FoFs is that they remove the need for tactical timing. Instead of deciding when to increase gold exposure or bet on silver’s rally, investors get a ready-made diversification within commodities.\nAccording to the Edelweiss report, a combined gold-silver portfolio has historically helped limit downside during equity downturns while still participating meaningfully in upside phases of precious metal rallies\nThis makes such FoFs particularly suitable for investors who want precious metals as a strategic allocation rather than a short-term trading bet.\nWho should consider gold and silver FoFs?\nGold and silver FoFs are best suited for investors looking to:",

        "full_content": "Most people land up comparing loans only when something has already gone wrong. A hospital bill arrives, a payment deadline looms, or cash flow just doesn’t line up one month. At that point, you are not shopping leisurely. You want money in the account, fast, and without too much back and forth.\nThat is where the choice usually narrows to a personal loan or a loan against securities. Both can solve the problem, but they feel very different once you start using them.\nWhy personal loans feel easier in a crisis\nA personal loan is straightforward. There is no asset to pledge, no portfolio to review, no daily tracking. If your salary and credit score tick the right boxes, the bank approves it and the money shows up. For someone already stressed, that simplicity matters.\nThe EMI is fixed, the tenure is clear, and nothing changes midway. You are not worrying about markets or margins while dealing with a family emergency. You just pay the EMI and move on.\nThe catch, of course, is the cost. Personal loans are expensive because they are unsecured. You pay interest on the entire amount from day one, even if you needed the money only for a short gap. If the loan runs for a few years, the total interest can add up more than people initially expect.\nPersonal loans usually work best when the amount is not very large, the need is immediate, and you want zero complications.\nHow loan against securities plays out in real life\nA loan against securities sounds more technical, but it can be very effective if you already invest. You pledge mutual funds, shares or similar instruments, and the lender gives you a credit limit based on their value.\nWhat makes LAS attractive is how flexible it can be. In many cases, it works like an overdraft. You draw money when needed and repay when cash comes in. Interest is charged only on what you actually use and for how long you use it.\nFor short-term needs, this can be significantly cheaper than a personal loan. It also lets you avoid selling investments at a bad time, especially during market corrections.\nBut it is not completely hands-off. Markets move. If the value of your pledged investments falls sharply, the lender may ask you to add more security or repay part of the loan. That can be uncomfortable if you are already dealing with financial pressure.\nLAS works best when you have a decent investment cushion, expect to repay relatively quickly, and are comfortable keeping an eye on things.\nThe emotional side of borrowing\nThis is the part people don’t talk about enough. A personal loan costs more, but it is mentally lighter. Nothing you own is at stake. A loan against securities is cheaper, but it ties your borrowing to market movements, which not everyone wants to deal with during a stressful phase.\nThere is no universally “better” option. The right choice depends on how urgent the need is, how long you expect to borrow, and how much complexity you can tolerate.\nIf you want speed and certainty, a personal loan does exactly what it promises. If you want lower costs and already have investments you are not keen to sell, a loan against securities can be a smarter tool. The key is choosing the one that lets you sleep better while solving the problem at hand.",

        "full_content": "Most of us treat a bank locker as the final stop for worry. Once the jewellery is inside, we mentally tick the “safe” box and move on. After all, it’s a bank vault. What could go wrong?\nThe problem is not theft or carelessness. The problem is assumption. Very few people actually know what happens if something does go wrong, and the rules are far less comforting than most families expect.\nWhat the bank will pay and what it won’t\nUnder rules issued by the Reserve Bank of India, banks do have responsibility in certain situations. If jewellery is lost because of fire, burglary, robbery, a building collapse, or fraud by a bank employee, the bank is liable. But only up to a point.\nThat point is 100 times your annual locker rent.\nSo if your locker rent is Rs 2,000 a year, the maximum compensation is Rs 2 lakh. Today, that may not even cover one small necklace or a couple of bangles. For families who have stored jewellery accumulated over decades, the gap between value and compensation can be huge.\nThis catches people off guard because many assume the bank will compensate based on what the gold is worth. It doesn’t work like that.\nNatural disasters? You’re on your own\nHere is the part most people don’t like hearing. If the loss happens because of floods, earthquakes, lightning or similar natural events, the bank has no financial liability at all. Zero.\nThe jewellery may be inside a reinforced vault, but financially speaking, the entire risk sits with the customer. Paying higher rent or choosing a bigger bank does not change this rule.\nWhy banks don’t insure locker contents\nBanks don’t insure what you keep inside your locker, and they are not allowed to offer you insurance for it either. The reason is simple. The bank doesn’t know what’s inside. There is no list, no valuation, and no record of what goes in or out.\nBecause of this, locker agreements clearly push the responsibility back to the customer. Most people sign these forms without a second thought, assuming it’s just standard paperwork.\nWhat actually protects your gold\nIf you want real protection, insurance is the only way to get it. General insurance companies offer jewellery cover that protects against theft, burglary, fire and even natural calamities. This protection applies even if the jewellery is kept in a bank locker.\nFor many households, the easiest route is to add a jewellery or valuables cover to a home insurance policy. These covers are broader than most people realise. In many cases, they also protect jewellery when it is temporarily worn for weddings or family functions.\nYes, there is a premium to pay. But compared to the value of gold today, it is usually a small price for knowing that a lifetime of savings is not sitting uninsured.\nShould you rethink lockers altogether?\nA bank locker still has its place, especially for jewellery that is rarely used. But it should not be mistaken for complete protection. Some people are exploring alternatives like gold overdrafts, where gold is pledged and the bank becomes fully responsible for its safety.\nThat option can also help unlock the value of gold without selling it, though it is not practical for jewellery that needs to be accessed frequently.\nThe bottom line\nA locker keeps gold physically secure, but it does not protect its full value. With gold prices where they are today, it is worth taking another look at what is in your locker and asking a simple question: if something went wrong tomorrow, would the compensation be anywhere close to enough?\nFor many families, adding insurance is not an extra step. It is the missing one.",

        "full_content": "One of the hardest questions in retirement planning is also the most practical one: how much money can you safely take out every year without running out?\nThere is no single number that works for everyone. The “right” withdrawal rate depends on how long your retirement might last, how your money is invested, how your expenses change over time, and how much flexibility you have if things don’t go to plan. But there are some useful ways to think about it.\nWhy this question matters more than returns\nMost people focus heavily on returns before retirement. Once retirement starts, withdrawals matter far more.\nEven a well-sized corpus can fail if withdrawals are too aggressive in the early years. This is because of something called sequence risk: if markets fall early in retirement while you are also withdrawing money, the damage compounds. You are selling assets when prices are low, leaving less money to recover later.\nThat’s why a “safe” withdrawal rate is really about protecting against bad timing, not just average returns.\nThe popular 4 percent rule, and its limits\nYou may have heard of the 4 percent rule. It suggests that you can withdraw 4 percent of your retirement corpus in the first year, adjust that amount for inflation every year after, and expect the money to last around 30 years.\nIt’s a useful starting point, but it has limitations.\nFirst, it was developed using US market data and assumes a specific mix of equity and debt. Second, it was designed for a 30-year retirement, not for someone retiring early or expecting to live into their 90s. Third, it assumes you stick rigidly to the rule even during bad years, which is rarely how real people behave.\nFor many retirees, especially outside the US or those retiring early, 4 percent may be optimistic.\nA more conservative starting range\nFor long retirements, many planners prefer starting closer to 3 to 3.5 percent. That may feel low, but it builds in a margin of safety.\nFor example, on a Rs 2 crore corpus, a 3.5 percent withdrawal means Rs 7 lakh a year, or about Rs 58,000 a month, before tax. That amount then rises gradually with inflation, assuming the portfolio supports it.\nThis approach gives your investments more room to grow and recover from market downturns.\nYour asset mix changes the answer\nWithdrawal rates are not independent of how your money is invested.\nIf most of your corpus sits in fixed deposits or low-yield debt, your sustainable withdrawal rate is lower because returns barely beat inflation. If your portfolio includes a reasonable equity allocation, the money has a better chance of growing over time, supporting higher long-term withdrawals.\nThat said, higher equity exposure also means higher short-term volatility. The solution is not avoiding equity entirely, but structuring withdrawals so you are not forced to sell equity during market crashes.\nMany retirees use a bucket approach: short-term expenses in cash and debt, and long-term money in equity.\nSpending does not stay flat in real life\nOne assumption that rarely holds is that expenses rise steadily with inflation forever.\nIn reality, spending often follows a curve. Early retirement can be expensive, with travel and lifestyle spending. Mid-retirement may be calmer. Later years may see healthcare costs rise, but discretionary spending often falls.\nA rigid inflation-linked withdrawal every year may not match how you actually live. Being willing to spend a little less in bad market years and a little more in good ones greatly improves sustainability.\nFlexibility is one of the most underrated retirement assets.\nTaxes and healthcare matter more than people expect\nWithdrawals are not just about headline numbers. Taxes can materially reduce what you actually receive, especially if most income comes from interest or taxable withdrawals.\nHealthcare costs are another wildcard. Even with insurance, out-of-pocket expenses tend to rise with age. A safe withdrawal plan always assumes higher medical spending later, not just average inflation.\nSo how do you decide what’s safe?\nA practical way to approach this is: Start conservatively in the first few years, especially if markets are expensive or volatile. Keep at least two to three years of expenses in safer assets so you are not forced to sell equity in a downturn. Review withdrawals annually instead of locking yourself into a fixed rule. And be honest about how flexible your spending really is.\nThere is no perfect withdrawal rate. But a cautious start, combined with sensible investing and periodic adjustment, does far more to protect your retirement than chasing an extra half-percent of income in the early years.\nIn retirement, longevity is the goal. The money just needs to last as long as you do.",

        "full_content": "On paper, Rs 2.5 crore sounds like a solid cushion to have if you are planning your retirement in your 20s, but the question to ask yourself isn’t whether the money is enough today, it’s whether it can keep doing the job year after year, for possibly half a century.\nThat’s where things get tricky.\nWhy the “FD-only” approach feels right but often isn’t\nFixed deposits are a safe option for most Indians. There’s little risk and predictable returns. When you’re already dealing with health issues or uncertainty, that predictability helps.\nThe problem is that life doesn’t stay still. Prices rise, medical costs creep up, and what feels manageable at 27 can look very different at 47 or 67. Your 6 percent FD return will not be able to stand up against inflation, and over time, withdrawals start cutting into the core of the corpus. And you will realise a little too late that the money isn’t stretching as far as you thought it would.\nStop looking at the corpus as one big number\nA more realistic way to plan is to break the money into parts, each with a clear purpose.\nUse one part of the money for stable returns. This is where FDs make sense. For example, putting around Rs 1.5 crore into FDs can give a steady annual income of roughly Rs 9 lakh at current rates. With some effort, such as spreading deposits across banks or choosing longer tenures, you might even be able to nudge it up a bit. Keeping some money in liquid funds helps handle surprises without panic.\nThis part of the money is about peace of mind.\nLet some money quietly work harder\nThen there’s the portion that needs to grow, but without giving you sleepless nights. Balanced advantage funds often fit here because they don’t force you to make constant decisions. They move between equity and debt on their own, depending on market conditions.\nPutting, say, Rs 50 lakh into such funds isn’t about chasing returns. It’s about giving the overall portfolio a gentle push so inflation doesn’t slowly eat away at it.\nWhy avoiding equity completely can backfire\nIt’s understandable to want zero exposure to equity when you’re no longer earning. But over a very long retirement, inflation becomes a bigger threat than market volatility.\nA small allocation to diversified equity funds, maybe another Rs 50 lakh, gives the portfolio some long-term strength. This money isn’t meant for everyday expenses or emergencies. It’s there so that ten or twenty years down the line, your lifestyle doesn’t have to shrink simply because prices have risen.\nThe key is keeping this slice small enough that market swings don’t cause anxiety.\nKeep things flexible\nNo plan made today should be locked in forever. Every few years, it helps to take stock. If equity has done well, move some gains into safer options. If expenses rise or health needs change, adjust accordingly.\nAnd one thing that’s non-negotiable in an early retirement: solid health insurance. No investment plan can compensate for large, unexpected medical bills.\nThe simple takeaway\nRs 2.5 crore can support an early retirement, but only if the money is allowed to do different things at the same time. Putting everything into fixed deposits may feel safe, but over decades, it quietly increases the risk of the money falling short.\nA mix of stability, some growth, and a little long-term risk is usually what helps the money last, not just look reassuring on day one.",

        "full_content": "Many people with serious long-term ailments like diabetes, thyroid issues, hypertension, asthma, or a past surgery, find buying health insurance daunting. You assume that you will either get rejected outright or charged outrageous premiums. And so you delay buying health insurance altogether, which usually makes things worse.\nThe truth is, you can get insured with a pre-existing medical condition, but how easy it will be for you depends on the timing, your health disclosure, and your expectations.\nFirst, what insurers mean by “pre-existing”\nAccording to insurers, a pre-existing medical condition means that you have had an illness, injury, or condition and you displayed symptoms, were diagnosed, and received medical treatment for before buying the policy. This includes conditions that you may be taking medication for or are managing routinely and not just serious illnesses.\nWhat matters is not how severe the condition feels to you, but whether it existed before the policy started. This definition is standard across insurers and is regulated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India.\nDisclosure is non-negotiable\nThis is the most important part, and also where many people go wrong. You must disclose everything you know about your medical history, even if it feels minor or under control.\nSkipping information to get a cheaper premium or faster approval can backfire badly. If a claim arises later and the insurer finds non-disclosure, they are within their rights to reject the claim or even cancel the policy.\nA good rule of thumb is simple. If a doctor has ever diagnosed it, prescribed medication for it, or advised follow-ups, disclose it.\nExpect waiting periods, not instant coverage\nMost health insurance policies come with a waiting period for pre-existing conditions. This is usually between two and four years, depending on the insurer and the plan.\nDuring this waiting period, expenses related to the declared condition are not covered. However, hospitalisation for unrelated illnesses or accidents is typically covered once the initial waiting period is over.\nThis is why buying insurance early matters. The clock on the waiting period starts only after the policy begins. The longer you wait to buy insurance, the later that clock starts ticking.\nPremium loading and exclusions are common\nIf you have a pre-existing condition, insurers may charge a higher premium. This is called premium loading. In some cases, they may also place permanent exclusions on very specific complications linked to the condition.\nThis does not mean the policy is useless. It simply reflects the insurer’s assessment of risk. What’s important is to understand what is excluded and what is covered, rather than focusing only on the price.\nAlways ask for these terms in writing before you buy.\nChoose the right type of policy\nWhen you have a pre-existing condition, a comprehensive individual or family floater policy is usually better than very cheap or limited-cover plans. Avoid policies with extremely low premiums and unusually high promises, as they often come with tighter conditions.\nIf employer-provided insurance is available, keep it active even if you buy your own policy. Group policies usually have no waiting period for pre-existing diseases, which makes them extremely valuable.\nSenior citizen policies and disease-specific plans are also options in certain cases, but they tend to be more expensive and restrictive.\nMedical tests are normal, not a red flag\nMany insurers will ask for medical tests before issuing a policy if you declare a condition. This is standard practice and not a rejection signal.\nThe test results help the insurer decide the premium, waiting period, or exclusions. Cooperating fully and getting these tests done early speeds up the process and reduces surprises later.\nRenewals matter more than the first year\nOnce your policy is issued, renew it on time every year. Continuity is critical. If you let the policy lapse and restart later, waiting periods may reset, and terms may change.\nOver time, as waiting periods end, coverage improves. Many people only start seeing the real value of their policy several years in, which is exactly why consistency matters.\nThe bottom line\nHaving a pre-existing condition does not disqualify you from health insurance. It just means you need to buy early, disclose honestly, read the fine print carefully, and stay invested in the policy long term.\nHealth insurance in this situation is not about finding the “perfect” policy. It is about reducing risk, avoiding catastrophic expenses, and making sure that when you do need care, cost is not the first thing you have to worry about.",

It’s just one of those things no one thinks about until it’s suddenly urgent.\nWhy IRCTC insists on Aadhaar for Tatkal\nTatkal tickets are meant for genuine last-minute travellers, not bots or bulk booking agents. That’s why Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation made Aadhaar verification compulsory for Tatkal bookings.\nNo Aadhaar link, no Tatkal button. Everything else works, but Tatkal stays locked.\nBefore you start, do a quick reality check\nSave yourself frustration and make sure:\nIf your Aadhaar OTPs don’t come through, nothing else will work.\nHow people actually link Aadhaar to IRCTC\nLog in to your IRCTC account. Don’t rush — this isn’t a Tatkal race.\nOnce you’re in, go to My Account and look for Link Your Aadhaar or Authenticate User.\nEnter your 12-digit Aadhaar number carefully. One wrong digit and you’ll end up retrying five times.\nYou’ll get an OTP on the mobile number linked to Aadhaar. Enter it, submit, and wait a few seconds.\nIf everything lines up, you’ll see a message confirming that Aadhaar is linked. No further action needed.\nNot sure if you already did this years ago?\nA lot of people forget they’ve already linked Aadhaar.\nLog in to IRCTC and open My Account. If Aadhaar is already linked, it will show as verified. If not, the option to link it will still be sitting there.\nIt’s worth checking now instead of finding out at 10:01 am.\nThe usual things that trip people up\nThe most common issue is a name mismatch. If your Aadhaar says “Ravi Kumar Singh” and IRCTC says “Ravi K S”, it often works. If the names are completely different, it won’t.\nThe second big problem is the mobile number. If your Aadhaar is linked to an old number you no longer use, OTPs won’t arrive. This isn’t an IRCTC problem — Aadhaar needs to be updated first.\nTrying again and again without fixing these usually just leads to wasted time.\nDoes this affect normal bookings?\nNo. You can book regular tickets without Aadhaar linking.\nThis only blocks Tatkal bookings, which is why people discover the issue only when they’re already stressed.\nBottom line\nIf you ever depend on Tatkal tickets, link Aadhaar to your IRCTC account when you’re not in a hurry. Do it once, check that it’s verified, and forget about it.\nBecause nothing is worse than losing a Tatkal seat to a missing checkbox.\nFrequently asked questions",

        "full_content": "Most parents don’t enjoy thinking about estate planning. For parents of children with special needs, it’s even heavier. The questions aren’t abstract or financial in the usual sense. They’re deeply personal.\nWho will look after my child when I can’t?\nWho will make decisions if I’m not there to explain things?\nHow do I make sure my child is safe, supported and not treated like a burden?\nThere are no perfect answers, but there are ways to reduce uncertainty.\nDon’t assume money alone will solve the problem\nOne of the most common instincts parents have is to make sure their child “gets enough money”. That instinct comes from love, but money on its own rarely solves the real issue.\nLeaving assets directly to a child with special needs can create complications. Managing money may be difficult. The funds may be misused, even unintentionally. In some cases, a direct inheritance can interfere with government benefits or other forms of support.\nEstate planning here isn’t about generosity. It’s about structure.\nWill is necessary, but it’s rarely enough\nA basic will answers one question: who owns what after you’re gone.\nWhat it doesn’t answer is how money should be used over time, who decides what is in your child’s best interest, or how care is coordinated year after year. That’s why parents in this situation usually need more than a will.\nThink of the will as the starting point, not the solution.\nWhy do many parents turn to trusts\nFor families with special-needs dependents, a trust often becomes the anchor of the plan.\nInstead of leaving assets directly to the child, assets are placed in a trust. The trust is managed by trustees you choose, with clear instructions on how money should be used — for care, therapy, housing, education, or daily living.\nThe real benefit isn’t control. It’s continuity. A trust can outlast you, adapt to changing needs, and protect your child from financial chaos or well-meaning but misguided decisions.\nMany parents also find comfort in knowing the money is ringfenced — it’s there for the child, not at the mercy of circumstance.\nTrustees matter more than paperwork\nThis is where plans quietly succeed or fail.\nChoosing a trustee isn’t about seniority or obligation. It’s about temperament, reliability and willingness. The role can last decades. Not everyone is suited for that, and that’s okay.\nOften, a mix works best: someone who knows your child well, paired with someone who understands money and compliance. And it’s wise to name backups. Life changes. Your plan should survive those changes.\nBe explicit about caregiving, not just finances\nMoney without clarity about care creates stress for everyone involved.\nWho will your child live with?\nWho will make medical decisions?\nWho will coordinate daily routines, therapies, and emergencies?\nThese roles shouldn’t be assumed. They should be discussed openly, agreed to willingly, and written down clearly. This is especially important when siblings are involved, because unspoken expectations can turn into resentment later.\nWrite the document only you can write\nAlongside legal documents, many parents leave something far more personal: a letter of intent.\nThis isn’t about law. It’s about life. It explains your child’s routines, preferences, fears, comforts, medical history, communication style and emotional needs. It tells future caregivers what works and what doesn’t.\nIt’s often the document people reach for first, long before they open a trust deed.\nAccept that this plan will need revisiting\nYour child’s needs will change. Policies will change. Family dynamics will change.\nEstate plans for families with special needs aren’t “set and forget”. They need to be reviewed more often than standard plans, not because something is wrong, but because life keeps moving.\nRevisiting the plan is part of caring.\nOne quiet truth\nEstate planning for parents of children with special needs isn’t about predicting everything perfectly. It’s about reducing avoidable uncertainty and leaving behind guidance, not just assets.\nDone thoughtfully, it’s less about control — and more about continuing care, even when you’re no longer there to provide it yourself.\nFAQs",

        "full_content": "Almost everyone believes OTP scams happen to “other people”. People who are careless. People who don’t understand phones. And then one day, someone perfectly sensible gets a call, a message, or a link, and things go wrong in under two minutes.\nThat’s the uncomfortable truth about OTP theft. It doesn’t rely on stupidity. It relies on normal human behaviour.\nAn OTP feels routine now. You get them for everything. Logging in. Making payments. Updating details. Verifying something that didn’t work the first time. So when an OTP arrives, your brain often treats it like background noise rather than a serious security step.\nAnd that’s exactly what scammers count on.\nHow it usually starts in real life\nOTP scams rarely start with anything dramatic. They start with something ordinary. A call saying a delivery couldn’t be completed. A message saying a payment failed. A warning that your account might be blocked if you don’t act. Sometimes it’s framed as help. Sometimes, as an urgency. Sometimes both.\nWhat makes it worse is that the person on the other end often sounds calm and informed. They may know your name. They may know which app or bank you use. That familiarity lowers your guard just enough.\nThen the OTP arrives.\nYou’re told it’s needed to “verify”, “reverse”, or “stop” something. That wording matters. It makes sharing the OTP feel like the safe choice. Like you’re preventing a problem.\nYou’re not.\nThe OTP is not a cancellation tool. It is an approval.\nOnce it’s shared or typed in the wrong place, the system assumes you meant to authorise whatever happens next.\nWhen no one even asks for your OTP\nNot all OTP theft involves a call. Some of the most common cases happen silently.\nYou get a message with a link that looks genuine. You click it because you’re busy or distracted. It asks you to log in. An OTP comes. You enter it. That’s it.\nAnother common situation involves screen sharing. Someone says they’ll “guide” you through a fix. You install an app. You allow screen access. From that point on, every OTP that pops up is visible to them in real time.\nSometimes the mistake is even smaller. Installing an app quickly and tapping “allow” on all permissions without reading them. An app that can read notifications doesn’t need you to share an OTP. It can see it arrive.\nWhat actually helps, day to day\nThere isn’t a clever trick that makes you immune. What helps is a mindset shift.\nTreat every OTP like a house key. If someone else has it, even briefly, you assume the house is no longer secure.\nIf an OTP arrives when you weren’t actively doing something inside an official app or website you opened yourself, stop. Don’t explain. Don’t argue. Don’t “just check once”. Stop.\nDon’t click links that ask you to fix accounts, refunds, or KYC. If there’s really a problem, it will show up when you open the app directly.\nDon’t install apps or enable screen sharing because someone on a call told you to. No genuine service needs to see your screen to help you.\nAnd most importantly, slow things down. Almost every OTP scam depends on urgency. The moment you pause, the scam starts to fall apart.\nIf you think you slipped up\nIf you realise you may have shared an OTP or entered it somewhere shady, don’t wait to see what happens. Act as if access has already been compromised. Block cards. Alert the bank or app. Change passwords. Watch transactions.\nPeople lose more money by hesitating than by making the initial mistake.\nOTP scams work because they fit neatly into everyday digital life. Protecting yourself is less about being tech-savvy and more about refusing to rush when someone else wants you to.\nFAQs",

        "full_content": "Extra money shows up in your account and the question arrives almost immediately. Should you throw it at your loan and get rid of some debt, or should you invest it and hope it grows faster?\nThere’s no single right answer. Anyone telling you otherwise is oversimplifying a very personal decision.\nThe smarter way to look at it is to understand when prepaying makes sense and when investing quietly does a better job.\nWhy prepaying a loan feels so satisfying\nThere’s something deeply reassuring about reducing a loan. The EMI stays the same, but the tenure shortens. Interest drops. The loan statement looks lighter.\nFor many people, this peace of mind matters more than spreadsheets. And sometimes, that instinct is absolutely right.\nIf your loan interest rate is high, especially personal loans,  credit cards, or older home loans taken at double-digit rates, prepaying is often the best use of surplus cash. Very few investments can reliably beat those rates after tax.\nThere’s also the emotional benefit. Fewer obligations mean more breathing room if income becomes uncertain. That safety has value, even if it doesn’t show up neatly in return calculations.\nWhen prepaying clearly makes sense\nPrepayment usually wins if your loan interest is significantly higher than what you can realistically earn elsewhere. Not theoretical market returns, but what you are likely to earn, consistently, after tax.\nIt also makes sense if you’re already stretched. If EMIs eat into your sleep, or one income disruption would throw things off badly, reducing debt is risk management, not conservatism.\nAnother situation where prepayment helps is when retirement is approaching and income visibility reduces. Carrying large loans into your late 50s or 60s increases vulnerability. In that phase, stability often beats maximising returns.\nWhen investing can quietly do better\nNow comes the uncomfortable part. Sometimes prepaying feels responsible, but isn’t the most efficient move.\nIf you’re on a low-interest home loan and you’re in the early or middle stages of your career, investing surplus money can often work out better over time. Especially if your loan rate is lower than long-term inflation-adjusted returns from equity or balanced investments.\nThis doesn’t mean chasing aggressive returns. It means recognising that money invested for 10 or 15 years has time to recover from market ups and downs, while loan interest remains fixed and predictable.\nThere’s also liquidity to consider. Once money goes into loan prepayment, it’s gone. You can’t pull it out easily if you need cash later. Investments, even conservative ones, usually give you more flexibility.\nThe tax angle people forget\nTaxes change the math more than people realise.\nHome loan interest deductions reduce the effective cost of the loan for many borrowers. On the other hand, investment returns are taxed too, sometimes heavily depending on the product and holding period.\nSo the comparison should always be after tax, not headline numbers. A loan at 8 percent with tax benefits may not be as expensive as it looks. An investment promising 10 percent may not deliver that post-tax.\nIgnoring this is one of the most common mistakes in the prepay-versus-invest debate.\nThe hybrid approach that works for most people\nIn real life, the answer often isn’t either-or.\nMany people do better by splitting surplus money. Part of it goes towards modest prepayment, reducing stress and interest. The rest goes into investments aligned with long-term goals.\nThis approach avoids extremes. You’re not betting everything on markets, and you’re not locking all liquidity into bricks and EMIs either.\nIt also helps psychologically. You feel progress on both fronts, which makes it easier to stay consistent.\nThe question that matters more than returns\nInstead of asking “Which gives higher returns?”, a better question is “What problem am I trying to solve?”\nIf the problem is anxiety, income uncertainty, or nearing retirement, prepayment often wins. If the problem is long-term wealth creation and you have time on your side, investing deserves more weight.\nMoney decisions aren’t made in isolation. They sit inside careers, families, health, and temperament. A choice that looks suboptimal on paper can still be the right one for a particular household.\nThe real mistake to avoid\nThe worst outcome isn’t choosing prepayment or investing. It’s doing nothing because the decision feels complicated.\nLetting surplus cash sit idle while you overthink the choice quietly costs more than either option.\nDecide, act, review. You can always adjust later. What matters is that your money is working in a direction that matches your life, not someone else’s formula.\nIn the end, the best decision is the one you can live with, stick to, and not regret when circumstances change.",

        "full_content": "For many Indian families, studying abroad is simply out of reach without borrowing. Once you add tuition, rent, insurance, travel, and basic living costs, savings rarely cover it. Banks are aware of this and are often quite willing to fund overseas education, especially for familiar universities and destinations. That willingness can feel reassuring, but it shouldn’t replace your own judgement.\nThink about repayment before anything else\nMost loan conversations begin with eligibility and how much money can be sanctioned. That’s the easy part. The harder part is repayment. Education loans usually come with a moratorium during the course and a short grace period after graduation. Once that ends, EMIs start on schedule, regardless of whether the student has found steady work. Many families assume the first job will come quickly and pay well enough. When that doesn’t happen, the loan turns into a constant source of anxiety.\nTax benefits exist, but they don’t ease monthly stress\nInterest on education loans qualifies for a deduction under Section 80E, which does reduce the total cost over time. But it doesn’t lower the EMI, and it only helps if the borrower is earning enough to actually use the deduction. Early career income is often uneven, especially for those on temporary roles or internships. In those years, the tax benefit looks good on paper but doesn’t help with cash flow.\nEmployment prospects matter more than the university name\nThe biggest risk with an education loan isn’t academic performance, it’s employability. Job markets, visa rules, post-study work options, and demand for specific skills vary sharply by country and course. A well-ranked university does not automatically lead to a job offer. Some destinations offer clear work pathways after graduation, others don’t. This uncertainty is why bodies like the Reserve Bank of India have repeatedly cautioned against borrowing heavily based purely on expected future income.\nCurrency risk is easy to underestimate\nMany students assume they will repay their loan from foreign earnings. In reality, plans change. People return to India, move countries, or take time off. If repayments end up coming from rupee income, exchange rates start to matter. A weaker rupee quietly increases the burden of a loan taken for overseas education, sometimes by more than families expect.\nCollateral means the family is involved\nLarge education loans often require collateral or a parent as co-borrower. That means the risk doesn’t sit only with the student. Missed payments can affect family credit records or put assets under pressure. This shared responsibility deserves an honest conversation upfront, not a rushed signature at the bank.\nThe takeaway\nAn education loan isn’t automatically a mistake, but it isn’t a simple decision either. Approval is easy to celebrate. Repayment is where reality shows up. Taking the time to think about job prospects, early income, currency risk, and the impact on the family can make the difference between a manageable loan and years of financial strain.",

        "full_content": "Before marriage, money is usually a personal problem. You earn, spend, save, or struggle on your own terms. After marriage, money becomes shared terrain, even if accounts stay separate. Decisions ripple. Habits collide. Things you could ignore earlier suddenly have consequences.\nWays marriage can help financially\nLiving together is usually cheaper than living apart. Housing costs, utilities, internet plans, groceries, and subscriptions tend to drop per person without anyone actively trying to save. It’s not dramatic, but it’s real.\nMarriage also nudges people into thinking longer-term. Buying a home, planning for children, or saving for later life stops being a vague idea and becomes a practical question. That shift alone can make people more disciplined with money.\nCredit access often improves. Two incomes generally look safer to banks than one. That can translate into higher eligibility or smoother approvals for large loans,  especially housing loans.\nThere’s also an income cushion. If one person loses a job, takes a break, or faces illness, the household may not immediately fall off a cliff financially. It doesn’t remove stress, but it can soften the blow.\nInsurance decisions become clearer. Life cover, health insurance, and nominations are easier to structure when there’s a legally recognised relationship. In emergencies, clarity matters more than clever planning.\nMarriage can also force financial honesty. Shared expenses mean conversations you could postpone earlier now have to happen. For many couples, that leads to better awareness of where money is actually going.\nFinally, some administrative things do get simpler. Claims, nominations, and succession tend to involve fewer grey areas once there’s a clear family structure.\nFinancial risks people don’t think about enough\nMoney habits don’t merge just because people do. If one person saves and the other spends, that gap usually widens unless it’s addressed early. What starts as tolerance often turns into resentment.\nShared financial commitments carry shared risk. Joint loans, guarantees, or even informal financial dependence mean one person’s mistake can affect both lives, sometimes for years.\nMarriage can quietly shrink financial independence. When one partner controls most decisions or access to money, imbalance creeps in. This becomes especially dangerous during career breaks, caregiving years, or periods without income.\nThe hardest risk to face is separation. Divorce or long-term separation has real financial costs, not just emotional ones. Legal fees, divided assets, disrupted income, and long recovery periods are common. Avoiding the topic doesn’t make it disappear.\nThe takeaway\nMarriage doesn’t change your relationship with money overnight. It just removes the hiding places. When couples talk early, stay honest, and respect each other’s autonomy, money becomes manageable. When it’s avoided, controlled, or assumed to “sort itself out”, it usually shows up later in more painful ways.",

        "full_content": "Most people take a joint home loan because it makes the numbers work. Two incomes improve eligibility and the EMI feels lighter when shared. That part is straightforward. What’s less obvious is how much responsibility comes with it, and how hard it can be to change things later.\nYou’re both responsible, no matter who pays\nBanks don’t split responsibility the way people do at home. If there are two borrowers, both are fully responsible for the loan.  It doesn’t matter whose account the EMI comes from or who earns more. If payments stop, the bank can recover the full amount from either person.\nMake sure the ownership matches the loan\nIdeally, anyone paying the EMI should also be an owner of the property. When someone is on the loan but not on the sale deed, problems tend to show up later. Tax benefits get complicated and legal rights over the house may be limited. Paying for a home you don’t legally own can leave you exposed.Q\nTax benefits aren’t automatic\nIn a joint loan, tax benefits depend on ownership and actual payment. To claim deductions, you need to be a co-owner, a co-borrower, and you should be contributing to the EMI. Just having your name on the loan isn’t enough if the payments don’t reflect that.\nYour credit records move together\nA joint home loan shows up on both credit reports. When EMIs are paid on time, both scores benefit. When they’re delayed, both take a hit. If one person already has a weak credit history, it can affect loan terms for the other. This matters even more today, with lenders following tighter risk rules set by regulators like the Reserve Bank of India.\nExiting isn’t easy\nIt’s easy to take a joint loan. Getting out is another story. If one person wants to step away, the other has to qualify to take over the loan alone or the property has to be sold. There’s no simple process to remove a name just because circumstances have changed.\nHave the awkward money conversations\nA home loan can run for 20 years or more. During that time, careers change, incomes fluctuate, and priorities shift. Talking early about who pays what, what happens during a career break, or what to do if someone wants to sell can feel uncomfortable. But skipping these conversations often leads to bigger issues later.\nThe takeaway\nA joint home loan isn’t a bad idea. It just needs clarity. Understanding the responsibility you’re taking on, how exits work, and how money will be handled makes it much easier to live with the decision in the long run.",

        "full_content": "If your credit score is stuck around 580, you already know the pain points. Loan rejections, higher interest rates, constant scrutiny. The good news is that credit scores are not permanent labels. They respond to behaviour. The bad news is that quick fixes don’t work. What does work is fixing the few things that matter most, and doing them consistently.\nHere are five moves that make the biggest difference.\nPay every bill on time, no exceptions\nThis sounds obvious, but it’s the most powerful lever you have. Late payments hurt more than almost anything else. Even a single missed credit card payment can drag your score down and keep it there for months. Set auto-debits. Keep a buffer in your account. If cash flow is tight, pay at least the minimum on time. Perfection matters more than amounts here.\nBring card usage down sharply\nHigh credit card utilisation is one of the fastest ways to keep a score stuck in the 500s or 600s. If you’re regularly using most of your limit, lenders read that as stress, even if you pay on time. Aim to use much less than your available limit. Paying down balances, even partially, can trigger visible score improvement within a few months.\nStop applying for new credit\nWhen your score is low, every new loan or card application works against you. Each enquiry chips away at your score and makes you look desperate for credit. Pause applications completely for a while. Focus on cleaning up existing accounts instead of adding new ones.\nFix errors on your credit report\nLow scores are often dragged down by mistakes. Closed loans still showing as active, payments wrongly marked late, or accounts that don’t belong to you at all. Check your credit report carefully. If something looks wrong, dispute it. Corrections can lead to sudden jumps that no budgeting trick will achieve.\nKeep old, clean accounts alive\nIf you have an older credit card or loan account with a clean history, don’t close it unless there’s a strong reason. Length of credit history matters. A long-running account with timely payments helps offset past damage and stabilises your score as it recovers.\nWhat “fast” really means\nGoing from 580 to 800 doesn’t happen in weeks. But visible improvement can start within three to six months if you’re consistent. The jump from “risky” to “acceptable” usually comes first. The climb from there to 800 is slower, but much smoother once the basics are fixed.\nThe bottom line\nA low credit score isn’t a character flaw. It’s a signal that something went off track. Fix the fundamentals, stop digging new holes, and give the system time to respond. Credit scores reward boring, predictable behaviour. If you stick to that, the number usually follows.",

        "full_content": "Indian stock markets have seen a sharp pullback from record highs. Both the Nifty 50 and Sensex have fallen over 4 percent in a week, unsettling many retail investors.\nThe Nifty 50 is down over 4 percent from its peak of 26,373.2, which it had hit on January 5, while the Sensex has fallen 4 percent from its high of 86,159.02 on December 1 last year. On January 20, the Nifty closed at 25,232, and the Sensex at 82,180, reflecting another day of losses in the market.\nAs markets turn volatile, a familiar question resurfaces: should you continue your SIPs or pause them until things settle down?\nFinancial advisors warn that this is exactly when most investors make costly mistakes when they stop SIPs, just as long-term wealth creation is about to take shape. Here’s why staying invested matters, and how to navigate SIPs during market corrections.\nLet’s explore the pitfalls, strategies, and mindset needed for SIP success.\nCommon reasons investors stop SIPs early\nMarket volatility tops the list, as short-term losses trigger fear and panic-selling during corrections, ignoring these are the very times when SIPs accumulate more units at lower prices.\nOther factors include comparing returns to trending assets or high-performing funds, cash-flow issues from job changes or expenses, and a lack of initial conviction about market cycles.\nLt Col Rochak Bakshi (retired), founder of True North Finance, a financial and investment planning firm said, “Recency bias, where investors chase recent highs, and loss aversion further exacerbate this, treating SIPs like short-term trades rather than disciplined investments. As a result, many exit just before the wealth-building phase begins.”\nThe High Cost of Quitting: Eroding gains through missed compounding\nQuitting early deprives investors of rupee-cost averaging in downturns and the compounding effect, which ramps up after 7-10 years. “SIPs thrive on time, not timing; early exits turn them into mediocre savings tools, locking in losses and forfeiting future growth,” said Vijay Maheshwari, founder of Stocktick Capital.\nConsider a Rs 75,000 monthly SIP at 15 percent CAGR: After 3 years, the total investment of Rs 27 lakhs yields Rs 34 lakhs, but continuing to 20 years builds Rs 9.97 crore on Rs 1.8 crore invested. Stopping at 3 years means an opportunity loss of Rs 9.63 crore; even stopping at 10 years (Rs 2 crore corpus), it's Rs 7.97 crore forgone.\n“Wealth creation is back-loaded—the first 7 years build a base, years 8-14 gain momentum, and the final phase explodes due to compounding on a larger sum. No timing or luck is needed; consistency alone drives this,” said Maheshwari.\nFor instance, a Rs 5,000 monthly SIP with 10 percent annual step-up and 12 percent returns grows to Rs 1.08 crore in 21 years. The investment phases show slow growth initially (Rs 8.37 lakh in 7 years), building momentum (Rs 34.81 lakh in 14 years), and exponential growth in the final phase (Rs 1.08 crore in 21 years).\nBoosting outcomes with step-up SIPs\nA step-up SIP increases contributions annually. For instance, for a Rs 5,000 starting SIP over 15 years at 12 percent returns, a conventional plan invests Rs 9 lakh for Rs 24 lakh maturity, while a 10 percent step-up invests Rs 15.3 lakh for Rs 36 lakh, a 50 percent boost.\nIdeal for salaried professionals or young earners, it suits late starters (e.g., age 45 with Rs 10,000 starting and 15 percent annual increase, yielding Rs 90 lakhs in 15 years) or those with small initial amounts.\n“However, it's unsuitable for self-employed individuals with inconsistent cash flows. Start in mid-30s when finances stabilize for maximum impact,” said Bakshi.\nAlso read | How NPS contributions cut your income tax under both old and new regimes\nPsychological barriers and advisor strategies\nImpatience for quick gains, especially in sideways markets, leads to exit within five years, as early modest returns erode confidence.\nSIP is a long-term concept and starts showing results only after 7 to 10 years. Most investors don't have the patience to stick to the process. “Frequent comparison with peers, market indices, or recently outperforming funds further weakens conviction and encourages premature exits,” said Maheshwari.\n“Successful SIP investing needs the investor to appreciate delayed gratification, which is a rare quality,” said Bakshi.\nAdvisors counter this by setting realistic expectations, explaining back-loaded returns, and communicating during dips to reframe them as opportunities.\nGoal-based planning ties investments to milestones like education or retirement, reducing short-term focus. “Automated step-ups, periodic reviews, and a behavioral guidance-based approach with hand-holding build discipline and prevent errors,” said Maheshwari.\nElements for turning SIPs into extraordinary wealth\nBeyond consistency, start early for exponential compounding, where later years generate most wealth. Gradually step up contributions, maintain asset allocation through rebalancing, and select quality funds with strong philosophies and risk management.\n“Uphold behavioral discipline by ignoring market noise, ensure cost and tax efficiency, and review portfolios regularly to align with goals,” said Maheshwari. These amplify outcomes without chasing high-risk returns.\nAlso read | Here is how to invest smartly if you earn Rs 1 lakh a month\nBuilding patience in volatile markets\nFor beginners, advisors recommend linking SIPs to goals (like buying a house) rather than focusing on returns, to handle market ups and downs. Automate investments, limit reviews to annually, and view volatility as a chance to buy low. Gradually increase amounts via step-ups, stay informed via credible sources without obsession, and remember compounding rewards endurance, not speed.",

        "full_content": "Inflows into mid-cap and small-cap mutual fund schemes touched record levels in 2025 despite sharp volatility in broader markets, the absence of foreign investors from these segments, stretched valuations, and muted earnings.\nAMFI data showed that mid-cap schemes received Rs 49,939 crore during the year, up 46 percent from a year earlier, while small-cap schemes attracted Rs 52,321 crore, an increase of 53 percent.\nMarket performance remained mixed during the period. The BSE MidCap index rose 1.1 percent in 2025, while the BSE SmallCap index declined 6.6 percent. In comparison, the Sensex and Nifty gained nearly 9 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively.\nAxis Securities’ Rajesh Palviya said the inflows were supported by steady SIP investments and investors continuing to add to their mutual fund holdings, based on the strong three-year and five-year outperformance of mid-cap and small-cap stocks over large-cap shares.\nMarket breadth stayed weak. Of the 140 stocks in the BSE MidCap index, 86 ended the year with negative returns, while in the BSE SmallCap index, 871 of the 1,186 stocks were in the red. In the BSE100 index, 61 stocks posted gains and 39 recorded losses.\nPalviya said investors have been using market declines to average their investments, as SIP inflows into mid-cap and small-cap schemes continue on a regular basis.\nDomestic investors have been the main source of net inflows over the past two years and have preferred mid-cap and small-cap schemes over large-cap funds. Foreign investors have largely stayed away from these segments and have mainly been selling large-cap stocks, which has further concentrated domestic flows into mid-cap and small-cap schemes.\nThe share of mid-cap and small-cap schemes in total equity inflows also increased during the year. Mid-cap funds accounted for a record 14.26 percent of total equity inflows, up from 8.7 percent in 2024 and 14.18 percent in 2023. Small-cap funds also saw their share rise to a two-year high of 14.26 percent, compared with 8.68 percent in 2024 and 25.4 percent in 2023.\nTotal equity inflows for the year stood at Rs 3.51 lakh crore, down 11.19 percent from Rs 3.94 lakh crore in 2024 and Rs 1.62 lakh crore in 2023.\nAnalysts said the absence of outflows despite nearly 16 months of muted returns indicates continued investor commitment. They said many investors remain focused on a three- to four-year horizon, even as near-term returns have been weak, while investment in assets such as gold and silver at current elevated prices is harder to justify for long-term allocations.\nIndependent research analyst Ambreesh Baliga said inflows into mutual funds are likely to continue going ahead as mid-cap and small-cap funds have delivered better results than individual portfolios. While many individual portfolios are down 20 percent to 30 percent or more, he said even the worst-performing mid-cap and small-cap funds were down only about 5 percent to 6 percent as of the end of December.\nBaliga said investor interest remains as long as losses are limited. He added that when losses become large, investors stop averaging, liquidity in the secondary market declines, selling pressure rises, and stocks can fall further, sometimes leading to margin calls.",

        "full_content": "The Indian mutual fund industry’s assets under management (AUM) eased slightly to about Rs 80.2 lakh crore in December 2025, down from Rs 80.8 lakh crore in November, reflecting the impact of volatile markets and foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows. Market benchmarks mirrored this cautious sentiment, with the Sensex and Nifty slipping 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively, while broader indices also fell—the BSE MidCap declined 0.5% and the BSE SmallCap dropped 1.01%.\nDespite this overall dip, equity mutual funds, flexi-cap funds, and gold ETFs continued to attract strong investor interest, highlighting sustained confidence in long-term market opportunities. Equity mutual funds recorded net inflows of Rs 28,054 crore for the month, marking the 58th consecutive month of positive equity flows.\nHere are some of the key highlights\nRobust retail participation\nRetail participation remained strong, with 26.4 lakh new folios added during December, taking the total number of folios in the industry to 26.12 crore. In December, 23 open-ended schemes mobilised a combined Rs 4,074 crore. Equity-oriented funds led both in launches and collections, raising Rs 3,568 crore, including the highest collection of Rs 2,468 crore by Abakkus Flexi Cap Fund. Hybrid schemes attracted Rs 302 crore, while the sole debt fund, Abakkus Liquid Fund, raised Rs 34 crore. Other schemes, including 15 index funds and ETFs, garnered Rs 170 crore.\nRetail MF folios across Equity, Hybrid, and Solution Oriented schemes increased to 20,27,86,198 in December 2025, compared with 20,15,85,661 in November 2025, indicating steady growth in retail participation. Correspondingly, Retail AUM for these segments stood at Rs 47.36 lakh crore as of December 2025, highlighting sustained investor confidence and continued asset accumulation in the retail mutual fund space.\nFlexi-cap funds lead equity inflows\nFlexi-cap funds emerged as the standout category, recording a 23.2% month-on-month rise in inflows to Rs 10,019 crore, making them the largest contributor to equity flows for December. Himanshu Srivastava, Principal Research at Morningstar Investment Research India, said, “The moderation in flows could be attributed to cooling momentum in mid-cap and small-cap segments, where inflows tapered after a strong run-up in valuations and periodic market corrections. Investors are adopting a more selective and disciplined approach, balancing return expectations with valuation comfort. Market volatility has also prompted profit-booking during opportunistic moments.”\nSrivastava added, “The launch of the new Abakkus Flexi Cap Fund, which garnered net assets worth Rs 2,468 crore, boosted the overall inflow. The category continues to be the biggest beneficiary.”\nVaiibhavv Chugh, CEO of Abakkus Mutual Fund, noted, “Flexi-cap funds continue to be preferred as they allow inbuilt flexibility to maneuver across market caps. Large- and mid-cap funds are also relevant, given valuations in large caps are reaching comfortable levels. The industry-wide emphasis on asset allocation as a strategy to navigate volatility is clearly reflected in the growth of multi-asset allocation funds.”\nOther equity categories see mixed trends\nInflows in mid-cap and small-cap funds declined month-on-month by 6.9% and 13.2%, respectively, but remained robust at Rs 4,176 crore and Rs 3,824 crore. Large-cap funds and large-and-mid-cap funds saw declines of 4.4% and 9.1%, with inflows of Rs 1,567 crore and Rs 4,094 crore. ELSS funds recorded net outflows of Rs 718 crore, while dividend yield funds saw net outflows of Rs 254 crore.\nSuranjana Borthakur, Head of Distribution & Strategic Alliances at Mirae Asset Investment Managers (India), said, “With mid- and small-cap valuations appearing relatively expensive and market performance uneven, flexi-cap funds have emerged as a preferred option. These funds allow investors to adjust exposure across large, mid, and small-cap stocks, reducing the need for frequent allocation changes.”\nSectoral and thematic funds experienced the steepest decline, falling 49.3% month-on-month, though they still attracted Rs 946 crore. Borthakur explained, “The AMFI data shows a shift in investor preference toward broader, diversified categories. In 2024, elevated inflows into sectoral and thematic funds were driven largely by return chasing. Many investors have since recalibrated their approach, favoring balanced categories such as flexi-cap funds, which accounted for 23% of YTD net inflows in equity.”\nDebt mutual funds faced heavy redemptions, with net outflows exceeding Rs 1.2 lakh crore, led by liquid, money market, and short-duration funds. This was largely due to advance tax payments and quarter-end treasury withdrawals, a recurring pattern each fiscal quarter.\nHybrid funds, however, recorded net inflows of approximately Rs 10,756 crore, supported by strong interest in multi-asset allocation funds, which attracted Rs 7,426 crore—the highest in six months. Borthakur noted, “Within hybrid categories, a significant portion of inflows is directed toward arbitrage funds for short-term surplus deployment. Multi-asset funds have seen 30% of YTD inflows in hybrid, reflecting growing demand for diversified portfolios encompassing equity, debt, and commodities.”\nGold and passive funds continue to draw interest\nThe passive fund segment maintained momentum, with AUM reaching a record Rs 14.57 lakh crore. ETFs and index funds together saw Rs 26,723 crore in net inflows, driven largely by gold and silver ETFs.\nBorthakur said, “Gold has had an exceptional year, with net inflows into gold ETFs rising fourfold compared to last year. Gold is increasingly viewed not only as a hedge but as a strategic, long-term portfolio component.” In December, gold ETF inflows hit an all-time high of Rs 11,000 crore. Silver ETFs also drew strong interest, with inflows of Rs 3,962 crore, taking overall AUM to Rs 72,652 crore.\nSrivastava noted, “Strong gold price momentum through 2025, coupled with heightened safe-haven demand, has supported sustained investor interest. Indian investors increasingly view gold ETFs as a regulated, liquid, and cost-efficient alternative to physical gold, particularly during equity and bond market volatility. Steady allocations to gold ETFs, even amid market swings, underline their role as a strategic hedge and diversification tool.”\nSIP inflows reach record levels\nSystematic Investment Plan (SIP) inflows reached an all-time high of Rs 31,002 crore in December. SIP assets stood at Rs 16.63 lakh crore, accounting for 20.7% of total AUM, while contributing accounts rose to 9.79 crore, up from 9.43 crore in November.\nDuring December, 60.46 lakh new SIPs were registered, up from 57.13 lakh in November, while 51.57 lakh SIPs were discontinued or matured, compared with around 43 lakh in the previous month. This pushed the SIP stoppage ratio to 85%, up from 75.56% in November.\nSIF segment continues growth\nStrategic Investment Funds (SIFs) also gained traction, with AUM rising to Rs 4,892 crore from Rs 2,932 crore. The category saw inflows of Rs 1,933 crore, with hybrid strategies attracting Rs 1,571 crore, reflecting investor interest in structured, diversified investment approaches.",

        "full_content": "SEBI has decided to cut mutual fund base expense ratios making investing cheaper and more transparent for retail investors. The cut may look small at first glance, but it decides how much of your money actually stays invested instead of being eaten away by costs. Over time, that difference quietly adds up.\nUnder the new rules approved at SEBI’s board meeting on Wednesday, December 17 2025, expense ratios have been reduced by up to 15 basis points, with most asset slabs seeing a 10 basis point cut. For open-ended equity funds with assets below Rs 500 crore, the maximum charge has been lowered from 2.25 percent to 2.10 percent, while debt funds in the same category will now be capped at 1.85 percent .\nList of updated MF Expense Ratios\n1. Index funds/Exchange Traded Funds (ETF)\nCurrent (Including statutory levies) — 1.00 percent\nRevised (excluding statutory levies) — 0.90 percent\n2. Fund of Funds (FoFs)\nFunds investing in liquid schemes/index funds/ETFs\nCurrent (including statutory levies) — 1.00 percent\nRevised (excluding statutory levies) — 0.90 percent\nFunds investing ≥ 65 percent of AUM in equity-oriented schemes\nCurrent (including statutory levies) — 2.25 percent\nRevised (excluding statutory levies) — 2.10 percent\nOther FoFs\nCurrent (including statutory levies) — 2.00 percent\nRevised (excluding statutory levies) — 1.85 percent\nWhat Exactly Has Changed\nSEBI has also simplified how these charges are shown to investors. The Total Expense Ratio (TER) has been renamed the Base Expense Ratio (BER).\n“Earlier, investors tracked costs through the Total Expense Ratio (TER), which combined multiple expense components into a single figure. The move to a Base Expense Ratio (BER) separates core fund expenses from statutory levies, making the cost structure easier to understand and monitor over time,” says Niharika Tripathi, Head of Products and Research at Wealthy.in, a wealth management platform.\nThe BER will now include only the costs of running the fund, such as fund management fees, distributor commissions, and registrar and transfer agent (RTA) charges. Statutory costs like GST, stamp duty, Securities Transaction Tax (STT), Commodity Transaction Tax (CTT), and regulatory or exchange fees will be kept outside the BER and shown separately.\nIn simple terms, BER reflects what the fund house charges, while TER represents the final cost an investor pays after adding taxes and statutory levies. The revised limits apply across equity-oriented schemes, debt funds, index funds, ETFs, fund of funds, and closed-ended schemes.\nAlso read | National Pension System Update: Govt subscribers can withdraw full corpus up to Rs 8 lakh; entry and exit age raised to 85\nWhy A Small Cut Can Still Matter\nSo what does this mean for an investor’s savings?\nSEBI’s move to lower expense ratios by 10-20 basis points may appear marginal, but its impact builds quietly over time.\n“On the surface, a 10-20 bps cut looks negligible. But investing is not a sprint; it is a long, steady march. When these costs come down, more of your invested money stays invested and compounds more,” explains Col Sanjeev Govila (retd), Certified Financial Planner, CEO, Hum Fauji Initiatives, a financial advisory firm.\nLet’s understand this with an example. Here is the impact on a Rs 10 Lakh lump sum investment growing at a hypothetical 12 percent CAGR (pre-expenses):\nA 20-basis point reduction in expense ratio on a Rs 10 lakh portfolio over a 20-year period can translate into nearly Rs 2.95 lakh of additional wealth. This amount represents the net gain for the investor, arising purely from lower costs.\nGovila points out, “It is not an incremental return generated by market performance, but money that remains invested and compounds over time instead of being deducted as expenses. In essence, it is a direct saving that converts into higher long-term earnings through compounding.”\nAlso read | Will home-loan relief continue in 2026 after 125 bps repo rate cuts in 2025?\nThe Long-Term Effect\nGovila adds, “Every rupee saved from fees is an extra bullet available to fight the ‘demon’ of inflation. And these small numbers gain a bigger halo if we look at a 20bps cut as a 10-15 percent cost cut.”\nIn the short term, these savings are barely noticeable. But over long holding periods, they steadily improve outcomes. Over decades, such “small” reductions can make a meaningful difference to long-term goals.",

        "needs_deep_fetch": true,
        "full_content": "The debate between direct and regular mutual funds often gets reduced to a simple math problem. Direct funds are cheaper, so they must be better. Regular funds cost more, so they must be worse. In real life, the choice is not that clean. The right option depends less on expense ratios and more on how you make decisions, how disciplined you are, and whether advice actually changes your behaviour for the better.\nWhat really separates direct and regular funds\nBoth direct and regular mutual funds invest in the same underlying portfolio. The difference lies in how you access them. Direct funds are bought straight from the fund house or through platforms that do not offer advice. Regular funds are bought through distributors or advisors, and their commission is built into the expense ratio.\nThat commission is why regular funds have higher costs. Over long periods, this difference compounds and can reduce returns meaningfully. On paper, direct funds almost always win on pure return numbers.\nWhy lower cost is not the full story\nCost matters, but behaviour matters more. Many investors switch funds frequently, chase performance, stop SIPs during market falls, or panic when headlines turn negative. These mistakes can wipe out far more value than the cost difference between direct and regular plans.\nFor an investor who is confident, disciplined, and comfortable making allocation decisions, direct funds usually make sense. You save on costs, stay invested, and do not need hand-holding. But for someone who tends to react emotionally or gets overwhelmed by choices, the presence of a good advisor can actually improve outcomes, even after accounting for higher costs.\nThe role of advice in regular funds\nRegular funds are not inherently bad. They become expensive only when the advice adds no value. A competent advisor does more than recommend funds. They help with asset allocation, prevent knee-jerk reactions, align investments with goals, and act as a buffer between you and market noise.\nIf an advisor is genuinely involved in reviews, rebalancing, and goal tracking, the extra cost may be justified. If the interaction is limited to an occasional message or a one-time recommendation, the cost becomes harder to defend.\nWhen direct funds usually work better\nDirect funds tend to suit investors who have a clear plan and the temperament to stick to it. If you already know how to structure your portfolio, rebalance periodically, and ignore short-term noise, direct plans are a logical choice. They are also suitable if you enjoy tracking your investments and are willing to spend time learning.\nMany long-term SIP investors who invest in a small set of diversified funds and rarely change strategy find direct funds efficient and cost-effective.\nWhen regular funds can still make sense\nRegular funds can be useful for first-time investors, families with complex goals, or people who know they are likely to make emotional decisions during market stress. They can also work well for retirees or near-retirees who value guidance over squeezing out the last bit of return.\nThe key is accountability. If you are paying for advice, you should be receiving advice that clearly improves your decision-making, not just fund names.\nThe biggest mistake investors make\nA common error is switching from regular to direct funds purely to save cost, without changing behaviour. If you move to direct funds but start timing markets, jumping themes, or reacting to social media tips, you may end up worse off than before.\nAnother mistake is staying in regular funds indefinitely without questioning whether the advice is still relevant or valuable.\nA practical way to decide\nAsk yourself one honest question: if markets fall sharply and stay volatile for months, will I stay invested without reassurance? If the answer is yes, direct funds are likely suitable. If the answer is no, paying for good advice through regular funds may actually protect your long-term returns.\nThe best choice is not universal. Direct funds reward discipline. Regular funds reward those who need structure and guidance. What matters most is choosing the option that helps you stay invested, aligned to goals, and consistent over decades, not just the one that looks better on a return chart.",

        "full_content": "Cash buffers at active equity mutual funds slipped marginally in November, still remaining elevated despite benchmark Sensex and Nifty hitting fresh highs—an indication that fund managers are still treading cautiously.\nFresh data from ACE Equities show aggregate cash holdings in active equity schemes eased to 4.68 percent in November from 4.79 percent in October. In absolute terms, however, reserves held largely steady at about Rs 2.02 lakh crore, compared with Rs 2.03 lakh crore a month earlier.\nThe slight pullback in cash came even as Indian equities scaled fresh record highs, buoyed by hopes of a trade pact with the US and growing conviction that global and domestic central banks may begin reducing rates in the coming months.\nIn November, the benchmark indices extended their winning streak, with the Sensex rising 2.11 percent and the Nifty advancing 1.87 percent. The broader market, however, delivered a more mixed performance: the BSE MidCap index edged up 0.35 percent, while the BSE SmallCap index slipped 3.4 percent, reflecting selective investor appetite amid stretched valuations.\nAnalysts say the reluctance to deploy cash more aggressively reflects an underlying wariness about stretched valuations across market segments. While fund managers usually hold cash to cushion volatility, maintaining a defensive stance for too long can become a performance drag. Most fund houses are therefore choosing to align deployment with earnings visibility and valuation comfort rather than making bold cash calls.\nAmong large fund houses, SBI Mutual Fund, Parag Parikh, ICICI Prudential and Motilal Oswal trimmed their cash positions slightly in November.\nSBI MF reduced cash to 3.89 percent of its equity assets, down from 4.2 percent in October. Parag Parikh MF lowered its buffer to 21.37 percent, though it remained elevated relative to 22.17 percent a month ago.\nICICI Prudential pared cash to 5.01 percent from 5.33 percent, while Motilal Oswal and Nippon India MF cut their cushions to 6.52 percent and 1.65 percent, respectively, compared with 7.2 percent and 1.74 percent in October.\nSeveral others—including Wealth Co MF, Capitalmind MF, Trust MF, 360 One, Quantum MF and Bajaj Finserv MF—also reported meaningful declines in cash reserves.\nBy contrast, a handful of fund houses took the opposite route, adding to their liquidity. HDFC MF increased its cash buffer to 6.55 percent from 6.34 percent, Quant MF raised its holding to 13.9 percent from 11.77 percent, and Axis MF and Kotak MF nudged theirs up to 4.22 percent and 2.44 percent, respectively.\nSamco, LIC Mutual Fund, Helios, Unifi, Groww, Bank of India MF and WhiteOak Capital also reported notable increases in cash levels compared with the previous month.",

        "needs_deep_fetch": true,
        "full_content": "A new deep-dive on India’s alternative investment landscape shows that mutual fund alpha erosion has become structural and wealthy investors are voting with their capital. IVCA-360 ONE CRISIL’s latest report states plainly that the “decline in alpha generation of equity mutual funds since 2017, and the notable decline in yields of a majority of debt mutual funds… have prompted investors to search for alternative asset classes such as AIFs and PMS.”\nThe shift underlines a fundamental reconfiguration of how domestic investors, particularly HNIs, ultra-HNIs and family offices conceptualise public-market exposure. And the alternatives drawing their attention are not offshore funds or late-stage private vehicles but Category III AIFs and PMS, both of which sit squarely inside the public-markets ecosystem, operate with higher flexibility than MFs, and are showing measurably superior two- and three-year outcomes.\nOne of the findings in the report is that equity-linked AIF strategies, specifically those operating with listed and listed-plus-unlisted mandates, have consistently beaten the BSE Sensex PME+ benchmarks across six consecutive evaluation cycles from March 2022 to September 2024.\nThe pooled IRRs tell the story unambiguously:\nWhile mutual funds have struggled to extract alpha from broader indices amid institutionalisation and market efficiency, equity AIFs (particularly those with Cat-III-style flexibility) have preserved meaningful outperformance.\nFor HNIs and family offices, this is not lost. These investors now anchor the majority of AIF inflows, indicating a clear preference for concentrated, rules-based, high-conviction equity exposure over traditional diversified MF structures. PMS platforms that are closer in spirit to active stock-picking benefit from the same shift.\nDomestic capital now accounts for the majority of AIF commitments\nThis reallocation is happening on top of another structural shift: alternatives in India are no longer foreign capital–driven. Domestic LP share has increased from 50.3% (March 2024) to 52.7% (March 2025), an inflection point that the report flags as critical. Behind this rise are the exact investor categories that dominate India’s public markets: HNIs, Ultra-HNIs, Family offices, and Wealth-management platforms. Together, they contributed ₹72,667 crore of incremental domestic commitments over the period.\nThis matters because the same investor cohort that drives PMS flows, IPO subscriptions, high-conviction equity trades, long-short fund allocations and F&O-linked yield strategies is now allocating more to AIFs than ever before. Domestic wealth is funding India’s alternatives engine, not global funds.\nThe capital stack is also institutionalising. Government entities like SIDBI, NIIF, EDF, TDB, BIRAC and NABARD together contribute ₹24,293 crore, which is a meaningful national-level endorsement of alternatives as part of India’s financial architecture.\nRegulatory reforms are pushing AIFs closer to the public-market mainstream\nWhile performance is the core driver, regulation has accelerated the shift by making AIF structures cleaner, more transparent and more MF/PMS-like. The report highlights five major reforms between 2023 and 2025:\nDematerialisation of AIF units (2023): bringing operational parity with listed securities.\nStandardised valuation norms: creating comparability across PMS, MFs and AIFs.\nDirect plan + trail-only commission model (2024): reducing cost leakages and improving governance across distribution channels.\nRemoval of the priority distribution model: crucial for long-short and structured Cat-III products with complex waterfalls.\nCIV-based co-investment structure (2025): allowing cleaner participation for family offices and portfolio investors.\nThese changes reduce friction, enhance transparency, align incentives and remove legacy structures that prevented wider participation from mainstream HNI public-market investors.\nIPO cycle and liquidity support the expansion of equity alternatives\nThe public market cycle itself is providing strong tailwinds. India has averaged one IPO per day for two consecutive fiscal years—234 in FY25 and 119 in FY26 till September. The report links this high-velocity primary market to stronger exit visibility for equity-linked AIF strategies. In practice, this means better valuation discovery, easier monetisation, and faster DPI.\nDPI and capital recycling reinforce the migration\nDistribution data in the report indicates that many Indian AIFs, especially those with market-linked or short-duration mandates, have achieved significant capital returns within typical fund lives.\nDebt AIFs return 50% of capital in 3.1 years while real estate AIFs in 4.2 years. 28.4% of debt AIFs and 34% of real estate AIFs have fully returned investor capital (100% DPI)\nEquity-linked AIFs also show progressively improving DPI as exits accelerate\nFor family offices, whose portfolio construction moves dynamically with liquidity, these cashflows often cycle back into PMS, Cat-III funds or public-market primary issuances. The loop reinforces itself.",

The face value of each unit is US$ 100, with the Net Asset Value (NAV) computed on a daily basis. The scheme has no lock-in period and does not levy any exit load. The fund offers two classes of units: Class A (Direct) with a minimum initial investment of US$ 5,000 and minimum top-ups of US$ 500, carrying a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.30%, and Class B (Regular) with similar investment requirements but a higher TER of 0.60%.\nAccording to PPFAS , the fund structure offers several advantages for investors. There are no inheritance tax implications, and tax compliance is simplified since taxes are paid at the fund level. Additionally, the OPI route is permitted only through a GIFT City–based pooled vehicle, ensuring regulatory alignment. Investors also benefit from optimized costs, particularly in terms of foreign exchange conversion and transaction expenses. Overall, the framework provides strong compliance and robust governance standards.\n90-100% of the allocation will be to ETFs and UCITS linked to the respective index and around 0 - 10% to debt instruments.\nLast month at the Moneycontrol Mutual Fund Summit in Bangalore, PPFAS' Neil Parikh had said that they were set to launch three new international equity FoFs, aimed at helping investors diversify their portfolios towards global offerings.

The came together to decode how active fund managers can find alpha in a tough market.\nThe discussion began with a shared perspective that the present situation requires both confidence and caution. Sharing insights on the importance of strong risk management, Deepak Shenoy encouraged investors to prioritize large-cap companies with consistent earnings and reliable business models. Taking a more positive stance, Anish Tawakley, pointed out the early signs of improvement in sectors like consumer durables and defence. He urged investors to look past short-term market fluctuations to spot long-term prospects. Building on this, Harsha Upadhyaya stressed the need for disciplined valuation and the importance of maintaining a clear mind during volatile market conditions.\nFurther, the conversation shifted to sector allocation, where Deepak Shenoy favoured cyclical sectors such as industrial capital goods, cement, automobiles, and financials, which typically respond well to economic recovery. Anish Tawakley emphasized growth areas like technology, electric vehicles, and high-end manufacturing. Harsha Upadhyaya, On the other hand, believed that large-cap stocks offer the most balanced returns in times of uncertainty.\nHowever, all three speakers agreed that to find alpha today, you need to have a thorough understanding of the basics, be able to clearly see market trends, and be patient. Together, they supported India's changing environment, which created great chances for anyone with a long-term investment strategy to do better than the rest of the market, notably in areas like home production, cars, healthcare, and electronics.\nThe session concluded with a shared belief: real alpha is built on strong, data-supported conviction, a disciplined strategy, and the patience to stick with a plan.

Industry leaders such as D.P. Singh, Deputy MD & Joint CEO, SBI Mutual Fund, Navneet Munot, MD & CEO of HDFC AMC, Akhil Chaturvedi, Executive Director & Chief Business Officer, Motilal Oswal AMC and Senthil Gunasekaran, Chief Business Development Officer, KFin Technologies came together to underscore how innovation, digital transformation, and investor behaviour are steering the industry into a new growth phase.\nKicking off the discussions, D.P. Singh spoke about the introduction of Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs). He described the product category as the bridge between traditional mutual funds and AIFs, designed to combine transparency with advanced investment strategies while ensuring investor protection and tax efficiency. According to him, this is a major step towards product diversification and innovation within a regulated framework.\nPicking up that thread, Navneet Munot highlighted the strengthening investor ecosystem, outlining four pillars driving the industry track record, technology, transparency, and training. He pointed out the doubling of HDFC AMC’s investor base in two years, crediting it to the widespread digital adoption and disciplined investing.\nBuilding on the conversation around behaviour and trust, Akhil Chaturvedi emphasised the role of investor conviction and education in fostering wealth creation. He stressed that education and steady engagement are what help savers become long-term wealth creators, especially as market participation grows beyond major metros.\nContinuing this idea of widening access, Senthil Gunasekaran shared insights on how digital transformation has accelerated distribution, with younger investors and B30 cities shaping inclusive growth.\nThe Bengaluru edition concluded with consensus that India’s mutual fund industry is entering a defining decade, powered by innovation, data-driven discipline, and digital empowerment aligned with national progress.

        "full_content": "Banking operations at public sector banks across the country are likely to be disrupted on Tuesday as the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) goes ahead with its nationwide strike on January 27, pressing for the immediate implementation of a five-day work week.\nThe strike call comes after a conciliation meeting held on January 23 with the Chief Labour Commissioner failed to break the deadlock. UFBU is an umbrella body of nine unions representing officers and employees of public sector banks.\nWith banks already closed on Sunday (January 25) and Monday (January 26) on account of Republic Day, customers could face disruption in branch-level services for three consecutive days.\n“Despite detailed discussions during the conciliation proceedings, there was no assurance on our demand. Hence, we have been compelled to proceed with the strike action,” All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) General Secretary C H Venkatachalam told PTI.\nAll India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC) General Secretary Rupam Roy said the move to declare all Saturdays as holidays was agreed upon between the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) and UFBU during the wage revision settlement in March 2024.\n“It is unfortunate that the government is not responding to our genuine demand. There would be no loss of man-hours as we have agreed to work an extra 40 minutes daily from Monday to Friday,” Roy said.\nNational Confederation of Bank Employees (NCBE) General Secretary L Chandrasekhar said the agitation was not directed against customers. “This movement is not against customers, but for a sustainable, humane, and efficient banking system. A rested banker serves the nation better. A balanced workforce strengthens financial stability. 5-Day banking is not a luxury; it is an economic and human necessity,” he said.\nBranch-level services such as cash deposits and withdrawals, cheque clearances and administrative work are expected to be affected at public sector banks, including State Bank of India (SBI), Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Bank of Baroda.\nPrivate sector lenders such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are expected to remain largely unaffected, as their employees are not part of the unions participating in the strike.\nDigital banking services, including UPI and internet banking, are expected to function normally, though ATM cash availability could face localised disruptions due to logistical issues.\nSeveral public sector banks, including SBI, have informed stock exchanges about the possible impact. “While the bank has made necessary arrangements to ensure normal functioning in its branches and offices on the day of strike, it is likely that work in the bank may be impacted by the strike,” SBI said in a regulatory filing.\nThe unions are demanding the declaration of all Saturdays as holidays, a proposal that was part of the 12th Bipartite Settlement signed with the IBA in March 2024 but is yet to receive government notification. Currently, banks operate on the first, third and fifth Saturdays of every month.",

This is not a qualification of the bank’s financials. This is a qualification in the subsidiary’s financials, which pertains to certain incidents in past years,” the management said.\nHe added that the financial impact of these issues had already been fully provided for in earlier years, and the ongoing exercise relates primarily to staff accountability and closure of investigative processes, rather than identification of fresh losses.\n“What is now going on is simply the investigation in terms of staff accountability and figuring out if there is anything open that is left. There is no financial impact coming out of this,” management said.\nResponding to questions on the nature of the investigation, the bank confirmed that the qualified conclusion relates to BFIL’s role as a business correspondent in the microfinance segment, and is linked to certain practices in past years, including around collections.\nManagement described the auditor’s qualification as procedural rather than adverse, noting that the auditors have stated they are unable to conclude whether any additional aspects require examination until the investigation is completed.\n“It is simply a qualified report stating that until completion of the investigation, they are not able to establish if there is any other aspect that needs to be looked at. But the financial implications are all taken,” the executive said.\nWhen asked whether the matter related to earlier frauds or defaults at the ground level, management responded in the affirmative, reiterating that these had already been identified and accounted for in previous periods.\nThe bank also emphasised that there is no financial implication on IndusInd Bank’s books, either standalone or consolidated, arising from the continuing qualification at BFIL.",

        "full_content": "IndusInd Bank has initiated disciplinary proceedings against officials found responsible for past accounting discrepancies, and has already concluded action in the majority of cases, the lender said in its latest disclosures alongside its Q3 FY26 financial results.\nIn a note to accounts, the bank said it had assessed the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in earlier irregularities and fixed accountability in line with its internal code of conduct.\nWhile disciplinary proceedings have been completed for most employees, the bank said remaining cases are still under process and will be taken to their “logical conclusion” in compliance with internal rules and applicable laws.\nThe disclosure assumes significance as it follows a series of accounting lapses identified by the bank during FY25, which had raised questions around internal controls, governance oversight and accountability within the private sector lender.\nDuring the financial year ended March 31, 2025, IndusInd Bank had identified multiple discrepancies across its books. These included irregularities in the accounting of derivative trades amounting to Rs 1,959.98 crore, incorrect recognition of interest and fee income of Rs 846.40 crore linked to its microfinance (MFI) portfolio, and manual accounting entries totalling Rs 595 crore posted under \"Other Assets\" and \"Other Liabilities\".\nThe bank had accounted for the financial impact of these discrepancies in FY25 itself, and informed investors that corrective steps were being taken to strengthen systems and processes.\nAs part of its response, the board had set up an executive-level project management group to oversee remediation measures. These included tightening internal financial controls, reducing dependence on manual entries, improving reconciliation processes and strengthening system-driven checks.\nIn their limited review report for the December 2025 quarter, the bank’s joint statutory auditors explicitly drew attention to the note on disciplinary action, stating that the bank has “initiated and completed the process of disciplinary action against majority of the persons involved in the discrepancies and irregularities”.\nWhile the auditors did not modify their conclusion on the financial results, the reference underscores the materiality of governance and accountability issues arising from the lapses.\nThe disciplinary action disclosure also mirrors a similar note in the standalone financial results, indicating that the process applies across both consolidated and standalone entities.\nThe bank has not disclosed the number of officials against whom action has been taken, the nature of penalties imposed, or whether senior management personnel were involved. However, the emphasis on fixing accountability and concluding pending cases suggests heightened regulatory and board-level scrutiny.\nIndusInd Bank said it remains fully committed to concluding the remaining disciplinary cases strictly in line with its code of conduct and prevailing laws. The lender added that progress on remediation measures continues to be monitored on an ongoing basis.",

        "full_content": "Punjab National Bank (PNB) has already transmitted a significant part of the recent rate-cut cycle to depositors, with deposit rates reduced from 7.25 percent to 6.60 percent by December and further lowered to 6.40 percent from January, Ashok Chandra, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, told Moneycontrol in an interview on January 22.\nOverall, around 55-60 basis points of deposit rate repricing has already been completed, Chandra said, adding that the transmission process is still underway.\n“The remaining 20–30 basis points of reduction should happen in the fourth quarter,” he said, indicating that banks will continue to recalibrate deposit rates in line with the changing interest rate environment.\nChandra noted that the staggered approach to repricing reflects a balance between protecting margins and gradually passing on the benefits of lower policy rates to depositors.\nEdited excerpts:\nIs the Q3FY26 profit the highest-ever reported by the bank. What has driven this performance?\nThere are multiple factors behind this record performance. First, we have significantly increased our focus on the retail, agriculture, and MSME (RAM) segments.\nMSME advances are growing at 19 percent, retail at 18.5 percent, and agriculture at over 10 percent. These segments contribute meaningfully more to profitability, and this strategic shift is now delivering strong returns.\nSecond, we have launched and strengthened several new verticals. They include supply chain finance, cash management services, and credit card business. While one of these verticals existed earlier, it has been significantly strengthened. Together, these three new departments are adding to the bank’s bottom line.\nThird, savings bank (SB) account mobilisation has played a key role. In April last year, we revamped our CASA products. Under the new scheme, we opened around 30.6 lakh new accounts, mobilising over Rs 20,000 crore in SB deposits. This has directly supported profitability.\nAnother important aspect is operating performance. For the first time, our operating profit crossed Rs 7,000 crore in the June quarter and remained above that level in the September quarter as well, showing consistency.\nFinally, recoveries have been strong. During the quarter, total recovery stood at Rs 4,090 crore, of which Rs 1,956 crore was technical recovery. All these factors together have driven the highest-ever profit for the bank.\nWhere do you see the bank’s profitability closing for the full year?\nWe are confident that our operating profit will remain above Rs 7,000 crore every quarter. Net profit is also expected to be more than Rs 5,000 crore every quarter on a consistent basis.\nCorporate loan growth was around 9 percent year on year. How does the corporate pipeline look for Q4 and FY26?\nIn the first nine months of this financial year, we have sanctioned corporate loans worth Rs 3.12 lakh crore, out of which disbursements of about Rs 1 lakh crore are still pending.\nFor context, in FY24-25, total corporate loan sanctions were around Rs 2 lakh crore. This year, sanctions have already crossed Rs 3.15 lakh crore, and by March-end, we expect this to exceed Rs 4 lakh crore, almost double that of last year.\nWe could have grown the corporate loan book by 11-12 percent, but we are consciously reducing low-yielding assets and IBPC (Inter-Bank Participation Certificates) exposures. This strategy supports long-term profitability and consistency. As a result, we expect corporate loan growth to be around 8-9 percent by the end of this financial year.\nYou have guided for a 60:40 RAM-to-corporate loan mix. Currently it stands at 57:43. When will this target be achieved?\nWe are aiming the 60:40 ratio in FY26-27. Most likely, this will materialise by Q3 or Q4 of that year, as building a high-quality RAM book takes time.\nHow will this shift in loan mix impact margins, especially after recent rate cuts?\nThe real positive impact on margins will be visible from Q2 of FY26-27, assuming no further rate cuts. Around 125 basis points of policy rate cuts have already taken place, but we have not fully transmitted these to deposit rates, particularly in Q3.\nSome deposit rate reductions, around 20-30 basis points, were implemented from January 1. Additionally, older deposits raised at higher rates, including a 7.25 percent special scheme last year, are now getting repriced. The combined impact should become clearly visible from Q2 of FY26-27.\nHow much of the rate cut has been transmitted to deposit rates so far?\nFrom 7.25 percent, deposit rates were reduced to 6.60 percent until December, and further to 6.40 percent from January. Overall, around 55-60 basis points of repricing has already been completed. The remaining 20-30 basis points should happen in Q4.\nWhat are your expectations from the February RBI policy?\nGiven the strong growth outlook and moderating inflation, we do not expect any further rate cuts in Q4.\nCASA has remained resilient despite industry-wide pressure, but it has declined slightly year on year. What are your expectations, going forward?\nWhen credit growth is running at 11-12 percent, CASA cannot grow at the same pace. A lag is inevitable. We believe 8-9 percent CASA growth is reasonable and achievable.\nCurrently, CASA growth stands at 5.66 percent year on year. While individual SB balances are growing well, institutional SB balances, particularly government accounts, are declining due to changes in government fund management under CNA (Central Nodal Agency) and SNA (Single Nodal Agency) frameworks. This trend is impacting the entire banking system, not just PNB.\nHow much has institutional SB balance declined over the past year?\nSB institutional balances have declined by around Rs 7,000 crore between December 2024 and December 2025. This decline offsets growth in individual SB and current accounts, impacting overall CASA growth.\nOn ECL provisioning, how much has been provided so far?\nThis quarter, we made total provisions of Rs 1,343 crore. Out of this, Rs 955 crore is towards ECL-related floating provisions.\nAs of now, we have built a cumulative floating provision of Rs 1,775 crore for ECL implementation. Depending on profitability, we may add further provisions in Q4. This gives us a strong cushion ahead of ECL implementation, potentially reaching around Rs 2,500 crore.\nIf we had not made the Rs 955 crore ECL provision this quarter, net profit would have exceeded Rs 6,000 crore. However, from a long-term balance sheet strength perspective, this approach is prudent.\nAre there plans to sell large NPAs through NCLT or ARCs in Q4?\nYes. We expect around Rs 500 crore recovery through NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal)  , Rs 250 crore through NARCL(National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited) , and about Rs 160 crore via ARCs. Overall, Q4 recoveries should be in the range of Rs 4,000-4,500 crore, similar to Q3.\nOur full-year recovery target stands at Rs 16,000 crore.",

        "full_content": "The rupee recovered 13 paise from the record low in the morning trade on January 22 on improved risk appetite after US President Donald Trump stepped back from his threat to impose tariffs on European allies over Greenland.\nAt 11.55 am, the rupee was trading at 91.5712 against the dollar. It ended the previous session at 91.70 after hitting a record low of 91.74.\nTrump, who headlined the World Economic Forum on January 21, said he has put together a “framework of a future deal” on Greenland, following a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on the sidelines of the WEF in Davos.\nTrump also said new tariffs on European countries that opposed his Greenland ambitions were no longer needed, signaling a softer approach after weeks of tension.\nOn January 21, the rupee sank to a new low of 91.74 against the dollar in the afternoon trade following risk-off sentiment over Greenland and consistent selling by the foreign investors, currency experts said.\nA DBS Bank India report said on the markets end, the maturity of short-term swaps in the NDF market contributed to the swift pace of depreciation this week. “Authorities have intervened to slow the pace of the rupee correction, although the measured rise in vols pointed to absence of speculative intent or panic,” it said.\nAmit Pabari, managing director at CR Forex Advisors, said the rupee’s weakness was largely driven by global risk aversion rather than domestic factors. Renewed geopolitical tensions pushed markets toward safe havens like the US dollar and gold, while equities fell, creating an unfavourable backdrop for emerging-market currencies and keeping the rupee under pressure.",

        "full_content": "Amid heightened volatility in the Indian rupee, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) net sold $9.71 billion in November, as compared to $11.88 billion in October, according to the central bank's monthly bulletin.\nThe data showed that the central bank gross purchased $14.35 billion, and sold $24.06 billion.\nIn November, the Indian rupee remained in the range of 88.56-89.45 against the US dollar. After this, the local currency started depreciating sharply amid outflows by the foreign portfolio investors (FPI) from Indian equities, and hit a mark of 91 against the US dollar in subsequent months.\nThe central bank has been defending the local currency since it touched and crossed the 91-mark by intervening in the spot market.\nThe central bank’s action came at a time when the rupee had been hitting consecutive record lows and, earlier this week. Such relentless depreciation triggered concerns over imported inflation and broader market sentiment, prompting the RBI to lean heavily on its foreign exchange reserves to stabilise the currency.\nThe currency has been under pressure in the last few months, especially due to the delay in the trade deal, which led to the currency hitting fresh record lows. On the other hand, the limited intervention by the RBI was also adding to the pain.\nIn the last three months, the rupee has been trading in the range of 88.20-91.74 against the US dollar.",

        "full_content": "Indian rupee has once again come under a huge pressure on January 21, after it hit a fresh record low of 91.74 against the US dollar during the afternoon trade due to risk aversion linked to the Greenland dispute and consistent selling by the foreign investors from Indian equities, currency experts said.\nThe local currency was trading at 91.68 against the US dollar at 2:12 PM, had hit 91.74 against the US dollar in afternoon trade. It opened at 91.08 against the greenback as against previous close of 90.9 against the greenback. It closed down 0.8% at record low of  91.69.\n“Rupee again faltered to a new low of 91.74 as Trump's Greenland issue, Japan bonds selloff and risk-off sentiment takes it lower with equities also down, keeping markets on a sixth straight day of decline,” said Anil Kumar Bhansali, Head of Treasury and Executive Director Finrex Treasury Advisors LLP. This is the biggest single-day fall for rupee in last three months.\nWith the current fall, the domestic currency turned out to be the second worst performing currency among Asian peers with a fall of 1.98 percent so far in 2026.\nBhansali added that FPIs have offloaded Rs 33,000 crore in Indian equities so far in January, with net sales on 12 days pressurizing domestic markets. “Delays in India-US Trade deal, higher US tariffs on Indian exports and elevated dollar demand from importers particularly those dealing in precious metals has exacerbated the slide.”\nFurther, the benchmark equity indices Sensex and Nifty extended their losses on Wednesday, slipping further after a sharp sell-off in the previous session, amid weak global cues and rising geopolitical concerns.\nIn early trade, the Sensex declined 1,056.02 points, or 1.28 percent to an intraday low of 81,124.45, while the broader Nifty fell 312.7 points, or 1.23 percent to 24,919.80, slipping below the 25,000-mark for the first time in over four months. However, a swift recovery led markets into green but again a selloff was seen where Sensex fell 500 points from day's high and Nifty fell below 25,150.",
