        "full_content": "Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are central to India’s growth story, contributing nearly 30% to GDP, around 35% of manufacturing output and over 45% of exports. MSMEs contribute nearly 62% to employment. Despite this economic significance, MSMEs continue to face structural constraints - particularly regulatory complexity, fragmented compliance requirements and constrained access to affordable growth capital. These challenges are now being further compounded by rising protectionism and fragmentation across global supply chains, constraining the sector’s ability to scale and compete.\nAs India approaches the Union Budget 2026, policy expectations have shifted beyond short-term relief towards addressing these systemic bottlenecks. The next phase of MSME reform must therefore focus on simplifying regulatory frameworks, easing capital constraints and recalibrating policy architecture from one centred on survival to one that actively enables scale and competitiveness.\nThe compliance paradox and need for rationalisation\nOver the past decade, India’s formalisation initiatives - spanning GST, digitised tax administration, and labour law consolidation - have undoubtedly strengthened transparency and expanded the tax base. Much of this compliance architecture, however, has evolved around the operational scale and systems of larger enterprises. Particularly, for micro and small units, the same frameworks translate into disproportionately high compliance costs and managerial intensity.\nWith limited financial and administrative capacity, regulatory compliances consume a significantly higher share of resources for smaller firms than for large corporations. This imbalance discourages formalisation and incentivises firms to remain below regulatory thresholds. Budget 2026 must therefore prioritise compliance rationalisation rather than incremental digitisation, with greater emphasis on proportionality and simplicity.\nTranslating simplification into liquidity\nFor MSMEs, regulatory complexities are not merely procedural challenges - it directly translates into working capital stress. Advance tax outflows, delayed refunds and procedural disputes immobilise scarce financial resources. Consequently, for compliance reforms, they must provide measurable liquidity relief.\nBuilding on this foundation, one immediate lever could be the implementation of quarterly GST return filing and tax payment as a default for MSMEs up to a higher turnover threshold, coupled with a lower interest rate. These would meaningfully ease cash-flow pressures.\nThis linkage between compliance design and liquidity is also particularly visible in the aftermath of recent GST rate rationalisation. While the revised slab structure lowered prices for consumers, many MSMEs now face an inverted duty structure, where inputs are taxed higher rate than finished products. This has increased refund dependency, leaving significant working capital stranded for extended periods. Thus, a time-bound, automated refund mechanism, along with selective rate corrections, would directly convert compliance simplification into usable liquidity. Extending refund eligibility to GST paid on capital goods (under the inverted duty structure) would further reduce the burden of working capital blockage for smaller units.\nBeyond domestic taxation, export facilitation schemes under the Foreign Trade Policy - such as Advance Authorisation and EPCG - are designed to conserve working capital by allowing duty-free imports of inputs and capital goods. In practice, however, stringent compliance conditions, manual processes and officer-driven closures often deter MSME participation. End-to-end digitisation and automatic licence closure upon fulfilment of export obligations would reduce discretion and allow MSMEs to access these schemes on a more equal footing with larger exporters.\nRegulatory certainty is equally critical. For MSMEs, uncertainty often imposes a higher cost than tax incidence itself. Aggressive audits and prolonged litigation lock up both capital and management bandwidth. Strengthening dispute resolution through time-bound conclusion and reduced pre-deposit requirements for MSMEs would materially support working capital requirements.\nCredit access, innovation and technology adoption\nEven with regulatory simplification, MSME scale will remain constrained without access to timely and affordable credit - particularly in a volatile global trade environment. Tariff actions and demand shocks have weakened cash flows, especially in export-linked segments. Accordingly, measures such as interest subvention, extension of NPA recognition norms and incremental credit lines under an ECLGS-type framework can help stabilise capital structure.\nCapital constraints also limit MSME investment in innovation and product development. For the sake of comparison, China’s “Little Giants” programme - under which niche, innovation-driven SMEs in strategic sectors are identified and supported - offers a relevant reference point. A calibrated approach in India, focused on selectively supporting high-potential MSMEs in technology-intensive areas such as robotics, drones, defence manufacturing and electronics, could strengthen innovation capacity through targeted funding and measured tax incentives.\nAt the same time, MSMEs continue to face challenges in adopting advanced technologies due to low capital intensity. While initiatives such as the RAMP programme mark progress, technology adoption remains uneven. Greater emphasis on targeted financing would help extend productivity gains across a wider segment of enterprises.\nTo conclude, India’s economic ambitions cannot be realised without MSMEs that are more productive and globally competitive. To support the MSMEs, over the past decade, the government has implemented a range of initiatives - from ZED certification, credit guarantee schemes, to RAMP. Budget 2026 presents a pivotal opportunity to build on this foundation - not by merely layering new schemes, but also by simplifying everyday regulatory interactions and enabling access to patient capital.\n(Rahul Khurana, Partner and Ashish Garg, Principal Associate at Economic Laws Practice.)\nThe above article does not constitute legal advice.

        "full_content": "Several payment platforms including CRED, RedGiraffe, PayZapp and NoBroker have resumed or continued to facilitate rent payments through credit cards after tweaking their processes to meet regulatory concerns, even as IPO-bound PhonePe has kept the service discontinued, people familiar with the matter told Moneycontrol.\nPhonePe had shut down rent payments last year after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) flagged concerns around misuse of credit cards for person-to-person transactions.\nIn its updated draft red herring prospectus (UDRHP), the Walmart-owned company disclosed that it suffered a revenue hit of around Rs 1,250 crore after exiting the rent payments business.\nMoneycontrol had earlier exclusively reported that PhonePe, Paytm and CRED had stopped rent payments on their platforms following regulatory scrutiny.\nRent payments make a comeback\nNow, some players have quietly restarted the service after back-channel discussions with the banking regulator, according to four different sources.\n“These companies brought the feature back after strengthening end-user and end-usage verification. This includes collecting PAN cards of both the payer and the payee, along with rent agreement documents,” one of the sources said.\nThe issue stems from the nature of credit cards, which are designed primarily for person-to-merchant transactions.\nCred, PhonePe and NoBroker did not respond to Moneycontrol's queries.\nWhat has changed now?\nFor rent payments to qualify, landlords effectively need to be treated as merchants, which brings them under stricter merchant KYC norms. The RBI was concerned that routine person-to-person transfers were being routed through credit cards by being presented as rent, creating regulatory and compliance risks.\nMost landlords are individuals, although those with current accounts are easier for payment platforms to onboard. At the same time, banks have grown wary of the segment because rent payments are typically high-value transactions.\nNearly 18 months ago, most banks removed rewards and cashbacks on rent payments as the cost of subsidising such transactions became unsustainable.\nDiscussions around rent payments also came up during the ongoing payment aggregator licensing process, according to industry executives.\nPayment firms argued that credit card payments to individuals are becoming more common as corporates increasingly work with freelancers, consultants, content creators and other independent professionals.\n“Stopping all payments to individuals through credit cards could disrupt a large and growing segment. With declarations, PAN-based monitoring and proper end-user verification, these transactions can still be tracked and scrutinised,” said a senior executive at a payments firm.\nPhonePe has chosen a different path.\nDespite rent payments being a meaningful revenue stream earlier, the company is prioritising regulatory certainty in a year when it is preparing for an IPO.\n“After what happened with Paytm, companies are far more conscious of regulatory costs. RBI has never explicitly said that rent payments through credit cards are fully permissible. It remains a grey area and is still under scrutiny,” said the CEO of a payment infrastructure firm that works closely with large banks.\nThe executive added that some credit card-issuing banks have independently stopped supporting rent payments, even without any formal directive from the RBI, signalling that discomfort around the segment persists despite the quiet comeback by some payment platforms.",

The next level should come by 2032… to reach 3nm chips manufacturing,” Vaishnaw said.\nHe added that the roadmap to reach 3nm and 2nm manufacturing would be a core pillar of Semicon 2.0, drawing lessons from how South Korea, Taiwan and Japan built their chip ecosystems.\nSpeaking at the event showcasing DLI 1.0 startups, Vaishnaw said the government’s original approach of providing EDA tools, IP access and multi-project wafer (MPW) support had been validated by the progress made so far.\n“So many of you (startups) have taped out and validated your products. Many of you have found markets,” he said.\nIndia has 24 startups under DLI and that the next phase aims to scale this to at least 50 fabless companies.\nUnder DLI 2.0, which will be rolled into Semicon 2.0, the government plans to concentrate support around six core chip categories: compute, RF, networking, power management, sensors and memory.\n“With these six, we can build any major system — whether it is defence, missiles, railways or automobiles,” Vaishnaw said.\nHe also indicated that tape-out facilities for mature nodes such as 180 nm would be anchored at SCL Mohali, while nodes down to 28 nm would be supported through the upcoming Tata fab in Dholera.\nThe minister said inputs from startups under DLI 1.0 would directly influence the design of the next scheme, including what should and should not be supported.\nAt the event, several founders flagged the need for stronger backing for analog and RF IP, preferential market access in strategic sectors, and help in bridging cost until volumes scale up.\nStartups at the event showcased chips already in tape-out or testing stages across AI, RF and broadband domains.\nTrivandrum-based Netra Semiconductor said its A2000 AI application processor taped out on TSMC’s 12 nm node in October and is now undergoing silicon testing, while its R1000 AI-MCU is expected to tape out next month.\nFermionix, an RF IC startup, highlighted demand from defence and satellite communications customers for its X-band radar chips and sought government support to expand into Ku- and Ka-band products.\nInCore Semiconductor, founded by the creators of IIT-Madras’ SHAKTI processor, reiterated its push for RISC-V solutions and preferential market access in critical sectors.\nVaishnaw also announced that the government will institute Deep Tech Awards in 2026 across sectors such as semiconductors, AI, space and biotech.\n“With Semicon 2.0, we will have a major part of the programme dedicated to reaching the 3nm and 2nm goal. By 2035, we should be among the top four semiconductor nations in the world,” he said.",

        "full_content": "As India enters a new fiscal year, markets are likely to reward a Budget that preserves macro stability while accelerating the next leg of private-capex and productivity-led growth. The policy challenge is to sustain high trend growth without re-opening the fiscal spigot, especially when global rates, geopolitics and supply chains remain uncertain. India’s recent fiscal strategy has been broadly credible: the Centre has reiterated a consolidation path, with the fiscal deficit targeted at 4.4 percent of GDP for FY26 and a stated intent to keep the glidepath intact.\n1) Fiscal prudence remains the market’s anchor\nBond markets care less about headline announcements and more about the durability of consolidation. The FY26 deficit target (4.4 percent) and the broader FRBM-aligned roadmap signal continued discipline, which should help contain term premia and crowd-in private credit over time. A prudence-first approach is also consistent with sustaining India’s capex push without destabilising debt dynamics, particularly as interest payments already form a meaningful share of expenditure.\n2) Manufacturing support is key\nIf India’s \"Viksit Bharat\" ambition is to be job-rich (not just GDP-rich), manufacturing has to do more heavy lifting. The PLI architecture has begun shifting the export mix toward higher value-added categories and enabling scale. Government-reported outcomes indicate ~₹1.61 lakh crore investment, ~₹14 lakh crore production/sales, exports exceeding ~₹5.31 lakh crore, and employment impact of over ~11.5 lakh (direct + indirect) under PLI implementation progress. A pro-manufacturing Budget should therefore prioritize logistics, industrial clusters, power reliability, and trade facilitation—so that incentives translate into globally competitive cost curves.\n3) India needs 'humongous' capital for 2047 — reviving FDI/FPI is essential\nA credible development aspiration requires an investment step-up. The World Bank estimates India would need to raise the investment rate from ~33.5% of GDP to ~40% by 2035, alongside reforms that deepen integration with global markets, to plausibly reach high-income status by 2047. In that context, policies that unequivocally improve the ease of FDI/FPI—stable rules, faster approvals, predictable taxation, and frictionless repatriation—become macro-critical. Recent data show gross FDI inflows of USD 81.04 bn in FY25 (+14% YoY), with manufacturing FDI also rising, underscoring the payoff from investor-friendly policy clarity. Every progressive country in the world wants to attract capital for growth, and we are competing within the same capital pool. Thus, our taxation policies and ease of access should not only be alike but also best in class. We need a much more practical approach, which our current Government is very capable of.\n4) Tax reforms: a strong start but the real prize is a wider base\nIndia’s tax capacity improves most sustainably when compliance rises, and the base broadens. GST is a good example, reflecting formalisation and better compliance. Continued rate rationalisation, fewer exemptions, and simpler dispute resolution can further reduce compliance costs—helping widen the base and focusing on reducing rates.\n5) Strategic divestments: unlock resources and improve price discovery\nWith India’s capex needs large and persistent, strategic divestments can be a non-distortionary way to raise resources while improving efficiency. Budget documents and commentary suggest the government continues to budget “miscellaneous capital receipts” (including disinvestment/asset monetisation) rather than setting a single headline disinvestment number—yet the market would welcome a clear, time-bound pipeline and execution cadence. A mission-mode approach—especially in assets where private management improves outcomes—can enhance valuation realisation and credibility simultaneously.\n6) 'Out-of-the-box' metric: target business growth, not only tax growth\nBudgets often set tax-revenue growth “asks” for the revenue department. A more growth-maximising framing would be to set measurable targets for industry expansion, formal employment creation, and investment growth—because a larger economic pie typically delivers stronger, more durable tax buoyancy. The sharp rise in GST collections over time already illustrates how formalisation and growth can lift revenues without excessive rate pressure.\n7) AI as the next UPI moment: indigenous LLMs and the compute stack\nAI is rapidly becoming “general-purpose infrastructure.” India has begun building the rails: the Cabinet-approved IndiaAI Mission (outlay ₹10,371.92 crore over five years) explicitly includes compute capacity (10,000+ GPUs via PPP), datasets, and the development of indigenous foundational/large multimodal models. Follow-through matters—especially investments across data centres, GPUs/accelerators, and hardware supply chains—so India can avoid strategic dependence while enabling domestic productivity gains across sectors.\nBottom line for markets\nA pro-business, pro-growth, pro-reform Budget—anchored in fiscal prudence, manufacturing scale, frictionless capital flows, continued tax-base widening, credible divestment execution, and mission-mode AI infrastructure—would likely be welcomed by both equities and bonds. Fiscal credibility lowers the cost of capital; reforms lift the return on capital. That combination is the most durable “market expectation” India can offer.",

        "full_content": "Dear Reader,\nBringing change in India’s power sector is not an easy task. States control electricity procurement and distribution. Profligate politicians weaken the electricity distribution systems by offering free power, delaying tariff hikes and new investments. Yet, despite constraints, the central government is managing to bring about a positive change in the Indian power sector.\nConsider the latest data: power distribution companies reported profits at the aggregate level for the first time in recent years. The aggregate technical & commercial (AT&C) losses, which indicate distribution and billing efficiency, dropped from 21.9 percent in FY21 to 15 percent in FY25. The overall power generation mix improved as well, as our Budget Snapshot explains.\nThe power sector achieved this progress amid a rise in electricity demand and with minimal load shedding. Power deficit was at near zero levels in FY25. The gap between the average cost of electricity supply and revenue realisation narrowed. Payments to electricity suppliers improved.\nTo bring about the positive change, the central government linked additional financial resources to states and electricity distribution companies to improvement in operating metrics and reforms. Some states grudgingly adopted them, but the results are visible.\nStill, more work needs to be done to strengthen India’s power sector.\nThe transmission and distribution losses are way above global averages. India has to bring them below 10 percent. A large number of electricity distribution companies continue to make losses on electricity supply. Poor distribution and financial practices are imposing undue financial burden on electricity distribution companies and consumers.\nAnother big challenge is power tariffs. Electricity tariffs in India are not uniformly charged and are not globally competitive. Industrial and commercial consumers often pay high tariffs. This hurts competitiveness of goods manufacturers.\nTo get around the problem of high tariffs and power supply challenges, industrial consumers are increasingly resorting to captive power plants and private power purchase agreements. Consequently, the share of the industrial sector in total power consumption has remained flat in recent years.\nAt the same time, electricity usage by households and domestic users is rising. While this increases the dependency of electricity distribution companies on households for their revenues, readers should note that domestic users also pay different and often high tariffs depending on their area of residence (gated communities, urban areas) and level of electricity usage.\nAs electricity usage by households continues to rise, these practises and variation in electricity tariffs will increasingly come under scrutiny. It is better if electricity distribution companies bring greater transparency to electricity tariffs soon.\nTo strengthen commercial viability of the electricity sector, the government is planning to implement new measures through the National Electricity Policy, 2026.\nImprovement in electricity sector's finances, encouragement for more competition in supply of electricity, strengthening of electricity grid and expansion in share of non-fossil fuel capacity in electricity generation are among the objectives targeted by the National Electricity Policy. Faster clearance for the new bill and speedy implementation will go a long way in strengthening India's power sector.\nInvesting insights from our research team\nAxis Bank Q3 FY26 – steady quarter, valuation a draw\nIndusInd Bank Q3 FY26: Turnaround strategy awaiting execution pick-up\nShriram Finance: Sustained performance will be key to future stock re-rating\nKotak Mahindra Bank Q3 FY26: steady show, a great long-term story\nUrban Company Q3: Strong growth, but profitability hinges on execution\nJSW Steel: Can deleveraging, expansion plans offset margin headwinds?\nTracker\nPro Economic Tracker | Auto sales, consumer sentiment show improvement\nWhat else are we reading?\nMoneycontrol Pro Market Outlook | All eyes on Union Budget and Fed as markets brace for volatility\nRBI’s state finance report flags a problem politicians don’t want to name\nBudget Snapshot: The steady improvement in India’s energy mix\nRBI doesn’t hold back on liquidity measures, but needs a fiscal hand too\nCan NEP 2026 add spark to power reforms?\nIs Trump going soft on China while targeting US allies?\nTrying to change our minds about gold (republished from the FT)\nThe Long Road to the EU–India FTA: What 22 years of negotiations reveal about India’s trade strategy\nBudget 2026: Turning India’s clean energy ambition into execution\nBudget 2026 will test India’s innovation push and its impact\nThe carbon price set by EU that India cannot pay\nBudget 2026 could redefine India’s trade, tax, and growth strategy\nUnion Budget 2026: Key tax issues shaping M&A activity\nAs another budget approaches, judicial finality on the Money Bill’s remit is pending\nBudget 2026 must focus on innovation and deep-tech to drive growth\nThe ₹500 Paradox: Pre-budget reflections on value in a shifting economy\nBudget 2026: Four things MSMEs need as they enter the next phase of growth\nIndia’s reform express: Stability, sovereignty and a growth story written in data\nMarkets want Budget clarity and growth continuity without compromising fiscal discipline Markets\nIndia is still a structural overweight: BlackRock’s Samara Cohen on markets, AI and investor participation\nTech and Startups\nPersistent Systems sets sights on Europe acquisitions in push towards $5 billion revenue by FY31\nTechnical Picks: BEL, JSWSTEEL, OIL, VEDL\nWe have a crack team of reporters writing on everything startups and tech.

The company is expanding its capacity in transformers and high-voltage switchgear, which will enable it to target broader market demand in both domestic and export markets. We expect its power transmission segment to continue to grow at a higher pace than the power generation segment. We believe that the recent uptrend in commodity prices can have a near- to medium-term impact on margins until it is passed through. In terms of easing curbs on Chinese players to bid for government contracts, our interactions with industry participants indicate that Chinese players may be required to set up capacities in India if these proposals are accepted. Moreover, it will take time to get approval and quality certifications; thus, this move may not impact the industry immediately. We cut our FY26/27/28 estimates by 4%/5%/5% to bake in the impact of high RM prices and competition by FY28. We maintain BUY with a revised TP of INR3,400, based on 55x Dec’27E EPS.\nOutlook\nAs per our discussion with various industry players, if implemented, it will take 2-3 years for the impact to be visible in the domestic market.

The strategy is not novel, as the government from time to time has pump-primed the economy towards its potential GDP to sustain economic momentum.\nScaling up public capital expenditure\nAt the heart of our proposal lies a substantial increase in government capital spending—about 2.6% of GDP 2024–25 (PE), or nearly ₹5 lakh crore over and above existing plans in the next five years—to target investment in productive assets, ranging from infrastructure and logistics to green energy, housing, manufacturing, digital systems, and human capital.\nFor the budget year 2026–27, an incremental capex of ₹2.98 lakh crore is proposed out of the estimated ₹5 lakh crore capex in the next five years. Empirical evidence shows capital expenditure multipliers peak in the first 2–3 years, especially when infrastructure gaps exist. The goal is to raise near-term demand while simultaneously expanding the economy’s productive capacity. Table 1 describes the allocation proposed by PHDCCI.\nGrowth multipliers and macroeconomic impact\nPublic investment has one of the highest fiscal multipliers in the Indian context. Construction activity, materials, transport, and services respond immediately, while better infrastructure lowers costs for businesses over time.\nThe macroeconomic logic is familiar. Public investment has one of the highest fiscal multipliers in the Indian context. Construction activity, materials, and transport services respond directly, and improved infrastructure will lower costs for businesses over time. According to our estimates, the incremental capital push could lift GDP by roughly 0.7–1.1 percentage points over the medium term, once lagged effects are accounted for through a decisive push.\nEmployment generation and private investment\nIncremental employment generation was central to our budget proposal for pushing government capex. At a time when job quality and participation remain major policy concerns, our proposal is economically significant. Infrastructure and housing remain among the most labour-intensive sectors, absorbing large numbers of low- and semi-skilled workers. Our estimates suggest job creation, both direct and indirect, ranging from around 0.9 million to nearly 2.7 million over the coming years as a result of incremental government capex.\nThough public investment is not a permanent substitute for private enterprise, improved logistics, reliable power, digital connectivity, and urban infrastructure reduce risk and enhance returns for businesses. The public capex push will untangle not only higher corporate investment but will also reinforce India’s attractiveness as an FDI destination and should not be viewed through the lens of displacing private spending.\nIntegrating growth with sustainability goals\nOne of the more distinct aspects of our 2026–27 proposal is its integration of growth policy with climate and sustainability objectives. Green, ESG, and Sustainable Development Bonds are positioned as financing instruments for renewable energy, green hydrogen, and energy transition projects aligned with India’s target of 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030. Programmes such as the National Green Hydrogen Mission and solar rooftop expansion underline an attempt to combine fiscal expansion with global long-term decarbonisation goals.\nThe effectiveness of the strategy will depend on timely project rollout and coordination with states. But there are risks. Global financial conditions and commodity price volatility could complicate outcomes.\nConclusion: Capital formation over populism\nIn essence, our Budget 2026–27 proposal reflects a practical assessment of India’s growth constraints and opportunities. By prioritising capital formation over populism, the proposal reinforces the case for public investment as the link between today’s ambiguities and tomorrow’s growth.\n(Dr Ranjeet Mehta, CEO & Secretary General, PHDCCI.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

DXC Tech could be looking for cheaper options after it sold its Electronic City campus, sources said.\nPrestige Lakeshore Drive, located next to the Bellandur Lake, will house the new campus of the US-based firm, which employs over 20,000 people in Bengaluru. However, several employees have raised concerns over poor accessibility to the under-construction tech park, flagging commuting challenges.\nIt may be recalled that real estate developer Sattva Group acquired DXC Technology’s 20-acre Electronics City campus for around Rs 400 crore.\nSeparately, global investment firm Blackstone has leased approximately 4.5 lakh sq ft of premium office space at Prestige Lakeshore Drive.\nDXC Technology had not responded to Moneycontrol's queries at the time of publishing.\nORR shifts amid infra concerns\nThe move comes at a time when several companies along the traffic-clogged Central Silk Board-KR Pura stretch are reportedly exploring relocation options. Areas such as Whitefield, now connected by the Purple Line Metro and North Bengaluru near Kempegowda International Airport are emerging as preferred alternatives due to better connectivity.\nAlso read: Crumbling Outer Ring Road pushes more startups, firms towards North Bengaluru, Whitefield\nThe ORR Metro corridor, part of the Blue Line connecting Central Silk Board to KR Pura, is slated for completion by December 2026. However, given the city’s track record of infrastructure delays, industry watchers remain sceptical about the timeline.\nDespite being the nerve centre of Bengaluru’s technology sector, ORR continues to face persistent infrastructure challenges, including narrow and damaged roads, severe traffic congestion, water shortages, and flooding during monsoons. According to the Outer Ring Road Companies Association (ORRCA), IT firms along the ORR contribute nearly $22 billion, or about 32 percent of Bengaluru’s total IT revenue.\nAlso read: Bengaluru losing GCC edge to Hyderabad, tier 2 cities due to infra woes\nOther companies moving out\nBengaluru-based food delivery platform Swiggy has also moved its corporate headquarters from Embassy Tech Village in Bellandur on ORR to Sumadhura Capitol Towers in Whitefield.\nLogistics platform BlackBuck has also announced its exit from the ORR corridor, citing poor infrastructure.\nIn a social media post on September 16, chief executive Rajesh Yabaji said the company was relocating to improve employee commute, triggering widespread debate over Bengaluru’s infrastructure challenges and even drawing an invitation from Andhra Pradesh IT minister Nara Lokesh to shift operations to Visakhapatnam.\nYabaji later said BlackBuck would continue to operate from Bengaluru, with plans to split operations between Whitefield and Koramangala.\nAlso read: BlackBuck CEO’s post on Bengaluru’s crumbling Outer Ring Road jolts Karnataka into action\nPrestige’s pitch for Lakeshore Drive\nPrestige Group CEO and executive director (Office) Juggy Marwaha recently wrote on LinkedIn that Prestige Lakeshore Drive reflects the evolution of Bengaluru’s technology ecosystem.\nHe said the campus, developed on what was once challenging marshy land, has now emerged as a landmark workplace destination, backed by Prestige Group chairman Irfan Razack and global investment firm Blackstone.\n“Today, three global technology MNCs have validated that vision. They committed long before its potential was visible, and today they don’t merely occupy space here - they call it home,” Marwaha wrote.\nHe added that Prestige is developing seamless flyover access to the campus at its own cost and on its own land. Future plans include direct metro connectivity, e-bus integration, and a proposed Greater Bengaluru Authority-PPP project to transform Lakeshore Drive into a boulevard-style urban corridor.\nPrestige Lakeshore Drive\nOn the ground at Prestige Lakeshore Drive, the campus is still very much a work in progress.\nAs of last week, construction workers were engaged in basic infrastructure activity on the sixth floor, including drilling for electrical wiring, putty work, and moving ventilation equipment.\nWhile the building appears largely done, interior and services-related work remains pending.",

        "full_content": "The shares of automakers dropped in trade on January 27, after the India and European Union finalized their much-awaited free trade agreement (FTA). Analysts have commented on what lies ahead for the Indian automakers.\nIndia will gradually cut tariffs on cars from 110 percent to as low as 10 percent as part of its new FTA with EU, and fully abolish duties on car parts within five to ten years, the European Commission said in a statement.\nCurrently, the import duty levied by India on completely built-up (CBU) passenger vehicles is 110 percent for cars costing over $40,000, and 70 percent for cars costing up to $40,000.\nIndian automakers have long opposed such cuts, arguing that they would discourage investment in local production by making imported vehicles more competitive.\nShould you buy Indian auto stocks?\nThe India-EU FTA will provide EU carmakers greater access to Indian PV market, which is the third largest globally in terms of volume just behind US and China, PL Capital said. The domestic brokerage noted that luxury vehicles comprise approximately 1 percent of the Indian market, therefore the tariff reduction should not impact the mass market players like Maruti Suzuki and entry-to-mid-level vehicles from Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles (TMPV) and Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M).\nHowever, it added that the tariff reduction may impact premium plus cars from these players to a small extent. “Tariff reduction on BEVs from 100% is expected to be applicable after 5 years in a phased manner, giving the likes of TMPV and M&M some relief. This India-EU FTA, which has been under negotiation for long,” PL Capital said.\nThe immediate concern for equities is not the long-term competitiveness narrative, but near-term uncertainty around pricing, demand elasticity, and margin protection, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head, INVasset PMS. “Markets are reacting ahead of operational clarity, which explains the visible churn in auto counters despite the absence of any immediate earnings impact,” he said.\nFor investors, the analyst said that the key variables to track are premium-segment exposure, pricing discipline, localisation depth, and export optionality. “Companies with a strong SUV mix, diversified geographic revenues, and robust balance sheets are better positioned to absorb competitive pressure. In the near term, volatility in auto stocks reflects positioning and sentiment, not a structural reset of the industry’s earnings trajectory,” he added.\n\"There is a strong and positive signal of confidence in India’s long term growth story. India today is not just a large market, but a future ready economy backed by reforms and policies focused on building a globally competitive ecosystem. The India EU Free Trade Agreement would be a historic milestone benefiting both sides by expanding trade and enabling deeper exchange of technology and innovation,\" said Hardeep Singh Brar, President and CEO, BMW Group India.\nAuto stocks:\nThe Nifty Auto index was down more than 1.4 percent, as seen at 2.42 pm. M&M shares were the top loser on the index, falling more than 4.5 percent to trade at Rs 3,382.50 apiece. Maruti Suzuki and Tube Investments of India shares fell around 2 percent each.\nTata Motors Passenger Vehicles (TMPV), Ashok Leyland and Exide Industries shares were down over 1 percent each, while Hero MotoCorp shares were down nearly 1 percent.

        "full_content": "The shares of JSW Energy and Godrej Consumer Products dropped around 10 percent each on January 27 after their respective results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026 failed to meet analysts’ expectations.\nIndia Cements shares meanwhile jumped nearly 5 percent on Tuesday.\nJSW Energy Q3 Results:\nJSW Energy shares dropped to Rs 432.8 apiece, the lowest level seen by the stock since February 19 last year. This came after the company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 419.94 crore, marking a 150 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from Rs 167.83 crore net profit reported in the same quarter of the previous financial year.\nThe firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile grew more than 67 percent YoY to Rs 4,081 76 crore during the quarter under review.\nJM Financial said that the firm’s results marked an “all-round miss”, with debt and execution remaining the pain points. It noted that the company’s management expressed concerns about transmission connectivity beyond 2027, which is a potential risk for aggressive RE expansion. “The company also has 29.6GWh of locked-in energy storage capacity (26.4GWh pumped hydro, 3.2GWh BESS). We cut down our FY28 EBITDA (-17%) and PAT (-52%) estimates factoring moderation in new RE capacity additions and rising interest expenses,” it said.\nThe domestic brokerage however estimates gradual improvement in key performance parameters as JSW Energy progresses in its vision of 30 GW by 2030; Net Debt/EBITDA (6.2x in FY25 to 5.8x in FY30), Gross block/MW (INR 46.7mn/MW in FY25 to INR 69.3mn/MW in FY30) and RoE (6.0% in FY26E to 7.4% by FY30).\nJM Financial reduced its target price for the stock to Rs 614 apiece, implying an upside potential of 28.5 percent from the previous closing price, while maintaining its ‘Buy’ rating.\nMotilal Financial Services also noted that the firm’s Q3 revenue missed its estimates primarily due to weaker than expected generation at Ratnagiri, Barmer and KSK Mahanadi plants. It reiterated its ‘Buy’ view on the stock, with a target price of Rs 590 apiece, implying an upside potential of 24 percent.\nGodrej Consumer Products Q3 Results:\nGodrej Consumer Products shares dropped to Rs 1,117.10 apiece on Tuesday, the lowest level seen by the stock since early December last year. The company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 498 crore, marking a marginal decline from the same period last year. The firm's revenue from operations meanwhile rose 9% YoY to Rs 4,099.12 crore.\nJM Financial downgraded the stock to ‘Add’ from ‘Buy’, with a target price of Rs 1,355 apiece. This implies an upside potential of 9 percent over the stock’s previous closing price.\nThe domestic brokerage said that on the profitability front, gross margin may not materially change considering the shift in product mix, and improvement in EBITDA margin will be led by savings in media and other overheads. “Post the recent run-up (+12% in past 1 month) in stock price, NTM valuation of c.51x is closer to the long-term average and limits the upside,” it added.\n“In India, we see GCPL logging a high single-digit revenue growth, supported by new actions (favorable season for Household Insecticides likely to aid double-digit growth). We believe India OPM will see gradual expansion, to the higher-end of the normative margin band of 24-26% by FY28E, aiding high-teens EBITDA growth over FY26-28E. Indonesia is likely to be a drag – we see gradual recovery in performance. Africa cluster is likely to see sales growth momentum slowing to a high single-digit, while EBITDA growth is likely to log at a low double digit,” said Emkay Global.\nThe India Cements Q3 Results:\nThe India Cements shares rose to Rs 452.70 apiece, after seeing some decline during the previous session following the release of its Q3 results. The Chennai-headquartered cement maker posted a standalone net loss of Rs 5.72 crore in Q3 FY26, compared to a net loss of Rs 409.38 crore a year earlier.\nThe firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile gained around 23.5 percent YoY to Rs 1,114.13 crore.\nMotilal Oswal says India Cements is witnessing operational improvement under UltraTech's leadership with recovery in margins and steady improvement in capacity utilization. The brokerage expects the company’s revenue CAGR at 11 percent over FY25-28, led by a volume/realization CAGR of ~9%/2%.\nFollow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank\nAXSB saw a good quarter as core PAT beat PLe by 9.5% due to 3.1% higher NII and 4.9% lower opex. While NII increased by 3.9% QoQ, reported NIM fell by 9bps QoQ to 3.64% due to tilt in loan mix towards lower yielding corporate; its share increased to 32% from 29% a year ago. Opex was better led by 11% QoQ fall in staff cost; management attributed this partly to decline in employees (net decrease of 2,550 over 9MF26) and partly to increase in productivity. However, as bank is targeting a retail share of 58-60% from 55.6% as of Q3’26, opex growth could rise. Asset quality risks are abating but consistency in core earnings is a key.\nOutlook\nWe raise core PAT for FY27/28E by avg. 4% due to positive change in NII/opex. We keep multiple at 1.7x on Sep’27 core ABV and increase SOTP based TP to Rs1,500 from Rs1,425. Retain ‘BUY’.\nFor all recommendations report, click here\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "Asia’s green finance ecosystem is accelerating, most notably in India—a nation driving the region’s climate investment boom while the United States, once the global anchor of sustainable finance, slows under Trump’s administration.\nWith the landscape of climate capital being redrawn, India has emerged as a pivotal force—leading innovation, mobilising investments, and setting standards that will shape green finance across Asia and beyond.\nSince the reelection of President Trump, the United States has pulled back from global climate finance efforts. Rollbacks of transition finance (which enables high emitting industries such as cement or steel to decarbonise) and frequent reversals of ESG mandates have left US green bond issuance nearly stagnant. While federal agencies scale back climate disclosure rules and influential states ban ESG considerations from pension funds, the US presence in global climate finance negotiations has waned. This retreat has left international capital markets wary and fragmented—spurring a search for new leadership.\nIndia’s Green Finance Transformation\nIndia, meanwhile, has seized this moment with a transformative surge in green finance. In 2024, India’s sustainable debt market crossed $ 55.9 billion, up nearly 186% since 2021. Green bond issuances have been rising, driven by a new climate finance taxonomy—a framework that defines which investments genuinely aid the environment, ensures credible climate financing, and sets strict standards to prevent false claims of sustainability, known as greenwashing. Domestic funding dominates, comprising about 83% of green finance flows, with the private sector contributing almost two-thirds of capital and the balance coming from central and state government budgets.\nBehind these numbers is a clear policy ambition: India aims for net zero by 2070, but this decade is about hitting bold intermediate targets. Recent years have seen the country’s green finance flows jump 20%, to US$ 50 billion (INR 3.7 trillion) annually, spanning everything from utility-scale solar and wind projects to urban electric mobility, industrial energy efficiency, and climate-smart agriculture. Major players such as Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA), National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) and large corporates are rapidly issuing ESG bonds, while cities like Delhi and Hyderabad are pushing municipal sustainability bonds.\nIndia’s rise isn’t just about national ambition. Its policy and market innovations have made it the linchpin of Asia’s collaborative green finance frameworks. The Green Finance Facility (IGFF), launched in partnership with the World Bank, ADB (Asian Development Bank), and the Green Climate Fund, channels billions into clean energy and climate-resilient infrastructure, focusing especially on supporting hard-to-abate sectors like cement, steel, and energy storage. India’s approach—blending international resources with domestic capital and local innovation—has become a template adopted by neighbouring Asian countries.\nIndia’s leadership in initiatives like the International Solar Alliance and its role as an accelerator for blended finance (using government capital, guarantees, and subsidies to mobilise large private investments in sectors that are critical for sustainable development but often considered high-risk or with long payback periods by purely commercial investors) and risk-sharing platforms  (that help in mitigating risks associated with large investment projects) further highlight its position as a builder of transnational green investment ecosystems. While countries such as Singapore, Japan, and Korea push their green finance agendas, India often serves as a partner or model for emerging Asian economies outside China.\nSectoral Transformation: Clean Energy to Climate Resilience\nIndia’s policies are translating finance into tangible climate solutions.  At the end of September 2025, the country’s installed renewable energy capacity hit 247.3 GW, comprising 50.1% of the total installed power generation capacity. This surpasses the COP26 goal to reach 50% non-fossil fuel-based capacity by 2030 ahead of the target. The new taxonomy (a classification system that defines and standardises what types of investments activities qualify climate-friendly) ensures finance flows into clean energy, urban mobility, building retrofits, and climate-resilient agriculture. Adaptation finance—covering disaster risk management, flood control, and resilient farming—has nearly tripled, largely supplied by domestic sources but boosted by multilateral institutional partnerships.\nKey Challenges and the Road Ahead\nIndia’s clean energy momentum does not mean the path is easy. Fragmented regulatory structures, patchy sectoral standards, and risks of greenwashing persist. Achieving the Paris climate targets will require an estimated $2.5 trillion by 2030. New Delhi must deepen transparency, standardise reporting, and push for interoperability of green finance frameworks—the ability of different taxonomies and reporting systems to work together seamlessly, enabling clear, consistent, and comparable climate finance data across markets. Continued reforms and capacity building—especially among local financial institutions and project developers—will be crucial for sustained global credibility.\nTo conclude, as the US turns inward and global climate finance risks fragmentation, India is forging an ambitious new green finance blueprint—backed by cross-sector innovation, policy reforms, and public-private collaboration. The locus of climate capital is shifting east, and India isn’t just participating—it is architecting the future of sustainable development in Asia.\nAs the region evolves, India’s combination of urgency, scale, and collaboration presents valuable lessons and opportunities for the wider world. In this era of climate capital, Asia’s future is increasingly shaped by developments in New Delhi and across India’s renewable energy landscape—reflecting a broadening participation in climate finance and governance globally.\n(Ritesh Kumar Singh is a business economist and CEO, Indonomics Consulting Private Limited.

        "full_content": "India’s regulators have taken strong steps to bring climate and sustainability into mainstream finance. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has mandated structured ESG reporting through the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) Core, backed by industry assurance standards. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has proposed climate-risk disclosures that would make banks quantify exposure to physical and transition risks.\nTogether, these frameworks mark a shift from voluntary sustainability gestures to mandatory financial oversight. Yet, as the rules multiply, their foundations remain shaky. Each regulator -- SEBI, RBI, the Finance Ministry, and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) -- is moving on separate silos, using overlapping indicators and inconsistent definitions. What is missing is a single rulebook, a uniform set of quantified definitions, thresholds and timelines that bind these efforts together.\nSEBI’s ESG-debt framework demands pre- and post-issuance verification, but “green” eligibility depends on what issuers claim, not on a national standard. RBI’s climate-risk template is supposed to measure exposure to high-emission sectors, but has no link to any taxonomy thresholds. MCA’s digital reporting formats under the Companies Act capture environmental data but use different indicators. The pieces don’t talk to each other.\nThe Finance Ministry’s Framework of India’s Climate Finance Taxonomy, released earlier this year, was intended to provide the unifying anchor. A properly crafted taxonomy is necessary because it would be the dictionary of sustainable finance, defining what counts as climate-aligned activity and what does not. Without it, climate disclosure regimes become disconnected reporting exercises.\nTaxonomy without teeth\nThe draft taxonomy, however, remains qualitative. It divides activities into “climate-supportive” and “transition-supportive” but provides no emission thresholds, timelines or exclusion rules. By not quantifying what constitutes green or transition activity, the draft leaves too much room for interpretation, and potential misuse. If implemented in its current form, the taxonomy could undermine the very disclosure reforms it was supposed to anchor.\nContrast this with the EU Taxonomy, which sets technical screening criteria for each sector, defining measurable performance thresholds such as grams of CO₂ per kilowatt-hour of electricity or per tonne of steel. The ASEAN framework, too, uses a traffic light system, distinguishing green, transition and excluded activities. These quantifications make climate finance investable.\nThis lack of coherence matters because climate finance depends on trust that disclosures are comparable, that green bonds are genuinely green, and that supervisory data mean the same thing across regulators. Without uniform definitions, India’s climate finance system risks losing credibility just as it begins to gain significant scale.\nThe flexibility argument\nDefenders of the current approach argue that India needs flexibility. The economy is still industrialising and coal-dependent, and banks must fund both renewables and efficient coal. Many sectors lack clear low-carbon alternatives, and MSMEs cannot bear complex reporting costs. Strict thresholds could choke investment in transition technologies. The taxonomy therefore leaves space for interpretation, calling itself a “living document.”\nThat argument has logic, but only up to a point. Flexibility is not the same as ambiguity. If each regulator interprets sustainability on its own terms, investors and supervisors will lose trust in the data, and the capital markets would treat ESG labels as unreliable. Transition finance is useful only if it is conditional, bound by measurable milestones and expiry timelines. Otherwise, it becomes a cover for inertia.\nUniform definitions are more than semantics. They decide how much capital moves and where. Without them, banks may underreport climate risk, companies may overstate green credentials, and public finance institutions may finance projects that conflict with national climate goals.\nThe counterview is that India should move gradually. It should define principles first, then add numbers. But that sequencing reverses the logic of finance. Markets demand clarity before they commit capital. A taxonomy without numbers or timelines is not a foundation but a placeholder. Investors already face disclosure overload. If the taxonomy stays qualitative, market indifference is a major risk.\nFixing the taxonomy\nThe remedy is fairly straightforward. The first step is to quantify. The taxonomy should specify measurable performance standards and sector-specific thresholds such as emissions per unit, minimum efficiency improvements and share of low-carbon input for key sectors such as power, steel, cement, and transport to start with, which will be based on domestic research and existing benchmarks. Projects could then be judged on hard numbers, not intentions. This would give both issuers and investors confidence that climate labels have substance.\nSecond, the taxonomy’s transition category must be tied to time-bound conditions and sunset clauses so that “transition” finance does not become permanent. The third step is to synchronise. The MCA should embed taxonomy alignment into company filings through digital XBRL tagging. SEBI and RBI should align their disclosure templates with the same definitions so that firms and lenders report consistently.\nFourth, verification must be credible. SEBI has already approved accredited ESG assurers and industry assurance protocols. The Finance Ministry and MCA should build on that by creating a common national registry of qualified verifiers, following international assurance standards such as ISAE 3000 or the PCAF methodology. A larger pool of certified assurers is critically needed.\nInstitutional mechanism\nFinally, India needs an institutional mechanism to hold this system together. A Climate Finance Coordination Board, chaired by the Department of Economic Affairs and including SEBI, RBI, MCA, and the Environment Ministry, could maintain uniform definitions, decide update cycles, issue interpretive notes, and resolve disagreements. The Network for Greening the Financial System offers a functional model of such coordination among central banks internationally.\nIf these fixes are made, the taxonomy could become the backbone of disclosure, not a soft overlay. RBI’s climate disclosure and SEBI’s BRSR might then work in synchrony, not in tension. Investors would know precisely what “taxonomy-aligned” means, reducing scope for greenwashing. Credit flows would have direction and capital would reach genuinely transition-ready firms, not those adept at labelling.\nIf India fails to sharpen the taxonomy quickly, we risk having mandates without meaning. The narrative would be lots of disclosures, lots of assurance, but little confidence in what lies behind the numbers. Markets would discount taxonomy-based claims, and capital might sidestep the system entirely. In effect, India would build an architecture of green finance, but without structural integrity.\nWhy coherence matters\nThe price of incoherence could be costly. India’s green bonds typically trade at smaller spreads than comparable global issues, partly because investors remain unsure of the underlying definitions. Meanwhile, ESG funds are under scrutiny for inconsistent screening standards. The credibility gap will widen if the taxonomy does not bring all the moving parts together.\nA unified taxonomy can strengthen India’s market credibility. Quantified thresholds give investors measurable comfort, consistent disclosure formats lower compliance friction, and time-bound transition criteria show that India’s policies are serious, not symbolic. This coherence would not only attract foreign capital but also help domestic institutions like banks, insurers and mutual funds integrate climate risk without duplicating effort.\nFixing the taxonomy will not solve everything, but it is the logical starting point. Numbers create trust, rules create consistency, and coordination creates scale. Once these are in place, the government can move to the next layer of integrating adaptation metrics, launching digital monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems, and building blended-finance facilities that draw private capital into harder sectors. But without common definitions, even the best-designed instruments will misfire.\nAlthough the window is closing, India can still build a credible, investable climate-finance regime that matches global standards while reflecting domestic realities. A single rulebook that is quantifiable, verifiable and time-bound is the only way to turn India’s climate-finance intent into lasting market confidence.",

        "full_content": "With less than a month to go for COP30 in Brazil, where countries are expected to submit their 2035 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) — their national climate action plans — India finds itself at an important inflection point. These near-term targets are the stepping stones for long-term decarbonisation and climate resilience. As India prepares to submit its next set of NDCs, the critical task is to chart credible pathways that balance economic growth, energy security, and decarbonisation.\nIndia’s net-zero targets by 2070 set a clear long-term direction, but the critical task now is to chart credible pathways that balance economic growth, energy security, and decarbonisation. For the long term, while the target is fixed, India could pursue multiple pathways to achieve it.\nIndia beats the deadline\nThis year, India also reached another milestone — half of its power generation capacity now comes from non-fossil sources, five years ahead of schedule. Recent projections by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) and the Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy (AEEE) model 18 scenarios for India’s future emission pathways to examine how different trajectories—shaped by macroeconomic trends, a manufacturing-led economy, progress in energy efficiency, availability of low-carbon technologies, and societal choices—could influence the country’s emissions.\nThe good news: across all 18 scenarios, India’s emission intensity continues to decline in the coming decades. Moreover, at a time when developed countries such as the US and European Union are backtracking on their climate promises, our analysis suggests that India is on track to exceed its NDCs target of reducing the emissions intensity of its GDP by 45 per cent by 2030. These reductions are largely attributable to continued deployment of renewable energy, rise of clean technologies, and improvements in energy efficiency.\nYet, absolute emissions will rise\nThe next question is how India can stay on course for the long haul. Will it rely on rapid structural reforms, a manufacturing boom, behavioural change, or breakthrough technologies, or a mix of them all, to reach net-zero emissions by 2070? This is the question we climate researchers ask ourselves constantly.\nHowever, absolute emissions are expected to rise over time, reflecting fast economic growth, rising incomes, and growing energy demand. India is expanding its manufacturing base for increased self-reliance, particularly in future-facing sectors such as semiconductors. So, aligning industrial policy with clean energy integration will be essential to ensure that growth remains compatible with long-term decarbonisation.\nWhere do we go from here?\nThe real test lies in sustaining momentum and making strategic choices that deliver long-term, equitable decarbonisation. Our scenario analysis highlights several priorities that can help shape India’s next phase of energy transition.\nFirst, the government’s push for rooftop solar through schemes such as the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana must remain a priority.\nRooftop solar not only expands clean energy access but also brings long-term benefits—reducing transmission and distribution losses, easing pressure on public investments, creating local jobs, and limiting land-use conflicts in a densely populated country. Further, our analysis shows that power pricing reforms—particularly the gradual removal of large electricity subsidies—make rooftop solar cost-competitive with grid electricity in the residential sector. But affordability for poorer households must not be compromised. A price-sensitive market like India’s requires continued support for vulnerable consumers.\nSecond, India must scale up clean technology deployment, but with careful attention to trade-offs. Support for small modular reactors, as introduced in the Union Budget 2025–26 could strengthen grid stability, a critical need as renewable penetration rises.\nBut nuclear power is not a silver bullet: in displacing coal, it could also crowd out solar and wind, just as the rapid expansion of solar undermined India’s wind sector a decade ago. Balancing these technology choices will be essential to ensure that India’s clean energy transition remains both ambitious and sustainable.\nThird, India must double down on clean mobility. Extending the PM e-Drive scheme is vital—not only to cut carbon emissions but also to tackle urban air pollution.\nYet, our scenario analysis shows that even with a stronger push for buses, private two- and four-wheelers will expand as incomes rise. Better bus services also trigger a rebound effect, as more people shift from walking and cycling to buses, raising overall mobility demand. These dynamics mean emissions do decline, but less sharply than expected. The solution lies in diversified investments for cleaner mobility—scaling public transport, ensuring EV adoption across segments, and building charging infrastructure.\nFourth, energy efficiency and behavioural change, inspired by Mission LiFE, are indispensable for India’s net-zero journey.\nConcrete evidence from the Bureau of Energy Efficiency shows that India saved ~200 MTOE of final energy, equivalent to around 1.29 GT of CO2eq, and close to Rs 760,000 Crores in savings from FY2017-18 to FY2022-23.\nInvisible thread that’s key to net zero goals\nEnergy efficiency is invisible by design – diffuse, distributed, and cumulative. Yet, without it, India will not be able to achieve its net zero goals. Similarly, lifestyle choices—such as setting higher air-conditioner temperatures, reducing travel through work-from-home options, and adopting recycling—can deliver emission reductions of up to 10 per cent by 2050 compared to business as usual. These shifts also ease pressure on land and natural resources. Government and citizens must reinforce one another in adopting sustainable consumption patterns, so that everyday choices add up to systemic impact. Our research shows that personal choices do matter and can reduce significant emissions.\nIndia’s progress so far shows that ambition and achievement can go hand in hand. As the country prepares for negotiations in COP30, the lesson is clear: We need to continue understanding trade-offs and shape development priorities that are not only low-carbon but also resilient and equitable.\n(Pallavi Das is a Programme Lead with the Council on Energy, Environment and Water - CEEW and Satish Kumar is the President and Executive Director of the Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy - AEEE.)\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "India has set itself the ambitious target of reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity by 2030. To put this in perspective, it is more than the total power generation capacity of Japan and Germany combined. This goal is more than just a number; it is a declaration of intent that places India at the forefront of the global clean energy movement. However, it will require more than just constructing wind farms and solar parks. The true test will be whether clean power can be efficiently and economically provided to the communities and businesses that require it. Open access is the mechanism that can make this possible, giving companies a straightforward way to purchase renewable energy directly and at scale. The 500 GW target can become attainable if India makes open access a key component of its energy strategy.\nWhy Open Access is Key to Meeting Demand\nThe case for open access is clear. Commercial and industrial consumers account for nearly half of India’s electricity demand and pay some of the highest tariffs because of cross-subsidy structures. These businesses are also under growing pressure to cut their carbon footprint, both to stay competitive globally and to meet their own net zero commitments. For them, renewable energy is not optional; it has become central to long-term planning. With open access, companies can source renewable power directly from developers instead of taking on the expense and effort of building plants themselves. Group captive models, where several businesses share investment in a project, make this pathway even easier to adopt and scale. Open access also offers flexibility in terms of sizing the project as per a company’s own power requirements. Another major advantage is that industries have clear visibility of the cost structure in open access, which gives them greater confidence in future delivery tariffs. In many ways, open access can be the demand-driven engine that complements utility-scale projects and accelerates private investment.\nProgress So Far and Emerging Momentum\nEncouragingly, there has already been real progress. The Green Energy Open Access Rules of 2022 lowered the threshold from 1 MW to 100 kW, giving smaller businesses a chance to participate. They also set clearer timelines for approvals and introduced a digital registry to improve transparency. The results have been visible. Open access capacity has climbed sharply, with some estimates suggesting it nearly doubled between 2023 and 2024. This demonstrates that momentum grows swiftly when policy intent is clear.\nThe challenge now is to carry this progress forward. Businesses need predictable and transparent charges so they can confidently enter long-term contracts. A more uniform approach across states would cut complexity and create a level playing field for companies operating nationwide. Stronger transmission and distribution networks, together with consistent rules for banking surplus renewable power, will give the system resilience and flexibility. These improvements will also reassure both consumers and investors, creating a cycle in which growing demand attracts more investment and accelerates the spread of renewable energy.\nOvercoming Challenges\nLooking ahead, three areas matter most:\n• Keep open access charges predictable so renewable energy continues to be the more affordable option.\n• Align rules and approval timelines across states, using digital platforms to make the process quicker and easier.\n• Strengthen grids and expand storage so clean power reaches consumers consistently and at scale.\nThese are not just technical adjustments. They are an opportunity to shape an energy system that supports businesses, gives distribution companies cleaner supply options, and inspires confidence among investors. With thoughtful tariff design and transitional support, DISCOMs too can benefit from the growth of open access, building stronger and more sustainable portfolios over the long term.\nAligning Policy with Purpose\nThe benefits of making open access a central priority are significant. As corporate demand for renewable energy rises, it will draw in more investment and push costs lower. Net zero goals will move from paper promises to practical action. Developers will see steadier pipelines of viable projects, and India’s standing as a clean energy leader will grow stronger. Above all, the 500 GW target will feel less like a distant ambition and more like a milestone that is firmly within reach.\nIndia’s energy transition is one of the most closely watched in the world. The country already has the scale, the ambition, and the momentum. What it needs now is sharper focus on the policies that bridge supply with demand. Open access is that bridge. Making it a policy priority will not just help India meet its targets but will also set a benchmark for how large economies can build a future powered by clean energy.\n(Sanjay Gupta is CEO, Apollo Green Energy Limited.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

He added that silver is far more volatile than gold, and sharp rallies are often followed by equally sharp corrections once speculative interest cools.\n\"Entering at current highs could expose new investors to near-term drawdowns if prices consolidate or retrace sharply. A better approach for those who still want exposure is to use dollar cost averaging strategies, entering in small, staggered allocations that average out entry costs and reduce timing risk,\" he said.\nFor investors planning to exit their positions, Maxwell said that if silver was added as a tactical hedge or short-term trade, then this is a sensible area to book at least partial profits. \"Locking in gains and rebalancing back to target asset allocation helps protect against sudden reversals, which are common in precious metals,\" he said.\nHowever, investors with a longer-term view who believe in structural drivers like industrial demand and tight supply may choose to continue holding a core position, the expert added. \"This is not an ideal price for large fresh investments, and partial profit-taking for current holders is a rational risk-management move rather than a full exit,\" he explained.\nFollow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "As India approaches the Union Budget 2026, the clean energy transition stands at an inflection point. Budget 2025 laid important groundwork—doubling allocations for green hydrogen to ₹6,000 crores, launching the National Manufacturing Mission, and strengthening domestic supply chains. These measures have reinforced a powerful message: rapid decarbonisation can coexist with economic growth.\nThe results are visible. India’s non-fossil fuel capacity has crossed 260 GW, growing 22.6% year-on-year, with renewables now accounting for over 50% of the installed power mix. Yet, achieving 500 GW of renewable capacity by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2070 will require sustained and targeted fiscal support—especially for emerging segments where economics remain fragile.\nIn Budget 2026, three areas merit urgent attention.\nScaling-Up the Compressed Bio-Gas sector\nLaunched in 2018, the Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) initiative aimed to set up 5,000 compressed bio-gas (CBG) plants by 2023–24. While CBG blending obligations effective FY 2025–26 have revived momentum, progress remains uneven. Of over 1,100 registered plants, only about 160 are operational, and just 113 are currently selling gas.\nPolicy refinements—such as advance Central Financial Assistance (CFA), harmonisation under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, biomethane pipeline norms, and BIS methane purity standards—have improved the outlook. However, fiscal support has not kept pace with rising costs. Plant capex has increased from ₹4–5 crore per tonne per day (TPD) in 2021–22 to ₹6–7 crores per TPD today, yet CFA levels remain unchanged.\nCFA should be enhanced from ₹4 crores per 4.8 TPD to at least ₹6 crore per 4.8 TPD, without an upper cap.\nCurrent limits discourage larger projects, with plants above 12 TPD capped at ₹10 crore of support. A pro-rated CFA linked to actual capex—similar to the recent increase in viability gap funding for MSW-to-CBG plants—would encourage scale and attract long-term capital.\nEqually important is budgetary allocation. The initial ₹800 crore earmarked for Phase I (FY 2021–26) has been exhausted, and the additional ₹180 crore announced in September 2025 supports barely 10 plants. With over 1,000 plants expected to be commissioned by 2030, a cumulative allocation of around ₹10,000 crores is essential to unlock the sector’s potential.\nTo replicate ethanol’s success story, CBG economics must improve. While ethanol enjoys a premium of roughly 120% over fossil petrol, CBG trades at an 85% discount on an energy-equivalent basis. Supplementary revenues depend on market development assistance (MDA) for fermented organic manure and liquid fermented organic manure. Current allocations are inadequate to cover digestate processing costs.\nRevising MDA to ₹3–3.5 per kg for five years would stabilise unit economics during the scale-up phase.\nTaxation is another bottleneck. CBG plants face an inverted GST structure: output is taxed at 5%, while plant and machinery attract 12%, leading to blocked input tax credits and higher effective capex.\nAligning GST for CBG with wind and solar—where rates were rationalised to 5%—would significantly improve project viability.\nLeveraging carbon credit market\nFinally, carbon and renewable gas markets are approaching a turning point. The proposed Renewable Gas Certificate framework and forthcoming carbon credit trading system can provide additional revenue streams. Allowing CBG-linked certificates and carbon credits to be traded domestically and internationally under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement would further strengthen project economics, especially as global carbon prices remain well above India’s current proposed floor.\nGreen Hydrogen: Building homegrown capability\nThe National Green Hydrogen Mission has gained momentum, but achieving the target of 5 million tonnes of annual production by 2030 will hinge on domestic electrolyser manufacturing.\nTargeted customs duty exemptions for patented components and materials not yet manufactured in India can reduce capital costs and accelerate localisation—an approach already adopted for critical minerals and lithium-ion battery components. In parallel, incentives for integrated renewable-hydrogen projects can improve economics by reducing transmission losses and creating clustered industrial ecosystems around hydrogen hubs.\nBattery Storage: Strengthening the renewable grid\nAs solar and wind capacity expands, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) will be critical to manage intermittency and ensure grid stability. However, fragmented GST rates across BESS components inflate project costs. A uniform 5% GST—aligned with other renewable infrastructure—would accelerate deployment.\nIn addition, the viability gap funding introduced for 4 GWh of storage in Budget 2023 should be extended to larger capacities. Scaling storage is essential if India is to reliably integrate 500 GW of renewables into the grid.\nBudget 2026 is an opportunity to convert ambition into execution. By addressing these structural and fiscal gaps, India can strengthen its clean-energy value chains, crowd in private investment, and reinforce its position as a global leader in the energy transition.\n(Ashish Bhandari is MD & CEO, Thermax.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "The Union Budget 2025 continued India’s focus on the climate and sustainability agenda, with measures to advance clean-tech manufacturing, renewable energy adoption, sustainable agriculture and urban development, nuclear power development, and electric mobility, among many others. These steps were aligned with India’s 2070 Net-Zero commitment, supporting tangible progress reflected in rapidly growing renewable capacity, improving rooftop solar uptake, strengthening R&D for climate-focused technologies, and signalling the decarbonisation roadmap for hard-to-abate sectors. The Budget also made space for circular economy initiatives and dedicated support for MSMEs, reflecting an integrated approach to green growth. Building on this momentum, the forthcoming Budget 2026 is expected to deepen these priorities so that India can scale from intent to deliver across the next leg of its transition.\nRenewable Energy, Storage, and Grid Readiness\nEnergy transition remains central to India’s decarbonisation strategy. While renewable capacity additions have been encouraging, the next phase of India’s energy journey must address persistent challenges related to storage and transmission. Customs and tax support for battery manufacturing and the announcement of Viability Gap Funding have been positive, but Budget 2026 will need to deepen this support. Continued incentivisation for storage solutions and encouragement of scalability is a major area to watch. It remains to be seen which mechanisms will be used, given the aggressive pricing environment—whether through tax sops, inclusion under PLI schemes, mandated storage solutions, or financing support.\nAnother lever for strengthening energy security and sustainability has been the push for rooftop solar installations, which received an allocation of Rs 20,000 crore last year, up from Rs 13,500 crore. Ambitious targets and further allocations are expected to support the pace of adoption.\nBeyond core mitigation efforts, India’s environmental agenda requires robust, scalable technologies for air emissions, water efficiency, waste management, and industrial decarbonisation. Early-stage pilots in carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), green hydrogen, and alternative fuels underscore the potential of emerging technologies. However, their viability in the Indian context demands targeted investment, demonstration support, and accelerated commercialisation pathways. Technology and innovation will remain the backbone of India’s climate transition, and a continued push for R&D—particularly in energy-efficient and low-carbon industrial processes, as witnessed last year—is widely expected in the upcoming Budget.\nScaling Climate Technologies and Industrial Decarbonisation\nThe development of climate and sustainable finance, along with related market mechanisms, demands heightened attention. Deepening financial markets and encouraging attractive funding options are critical not only for meeting net-zero ambitions but also for improving efficiency across the system. The announcement and operationalisation of a Climate Finance Taxonomy would enable credible green finance and reduce greenwashing risks, which is crucial for investor and stakeholder confidence. Moreover, a fast-paced transition journey calls for financial incentives for green, social, and sustainable instruments for issuers and lenders.\nSuch mechanisms could be varied—preferential capital treatment, priority tagging and targets for lenders, concessional interest rates, lower processing fees, innovative and longer-tenor financing structures to support project viability, and rewards linked to credible ESG performance and ratings, to name a few. To improve access to green credit facilities and strengthen market discipline, introducing basic ESG disclosure norms for MSMEs and private players would be a positive step.\nMeasures to support a viable carbon market through a clear pricing architecture and robust monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) norms would offer confidence to all stakeholders—carbon credit buyers and sellers alike—and strengthen India’s Carbon Credit Trading Scheme. This would also help industries better prepare for decarbonisation targets and global stakeholder expectations.\nResource Security, Urban Resilience, and Inclusive Growth\nResource security through critical minerals and circular economy measures is another emerging strategic priority. The upcoming Budget is expected to accelerate the National Critical Mineral Mission, which saw a doubling of its allocation to Rs 3,500 crore last year. Given the importance of critical minerals and rare earth metals to manufacturing value chains, further announcements related to resource security are anticipated. Promotion of circular economy and waste-to-wealth initiatives through strong frameworks for inter-industry collaboration, support for related technology platforms, and expanded Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) initiatives would result in more productive and efficient value chains.\nAn update on the implementation and way forward for the Urban Challenge Fund of Rs 10,000 crore for the first year, out of a total planned allocation of Rs 1,00,000 crore, would also place climate adaptation in focus, alongside dispersed economic growth and water infrastructure development. Continued emphasis on irrigation and flood mitigation is anticipated, building on the existing Rs 95,000 crore allocation.\nSocial, Governance, and Sustainability for Inclusive Growth\nRecent labour reform announcements and expanded CSR requirements place greater responsibility on companies, while the Government’s parallel focus on skills development, women’s workforce participation, and social protection will help build a more capable and diverse talent base. On the governance front, initiatives to strengthen frameworks and oversight would be a positive step towards enhancing India Inc.’s long-term resilience and its ability to attract growth capital.\nBudget 2026 should deepen India’s climate and sustainability agenda by accelerating clean-tech manufacturing, renewables, storage, and scalable decarbonisation technologies. Strengthening the sustainable finance ecosystem through a Climate Finance Taxonomy and targeted incentives will be essential to unlocking capital for the transition. Progress on critical minerals and circular economy initiatives will be key enablers, alongside a continued focus on social and governance reforms that enhance India Inc.’s resilience and competitiveness.\n(Sheetal Sharad, Chief Ratings Officer, ICRA ESG.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "India has taken ambitious strides toward establishing a robust domestic carbon market through its Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), while simultaneously promoting a market-based environmental restoration through the Green Credit Programme (GCP). However, a critical oversight in these parallel initiatives threatens to undermine the integrity of both systems: the explicit permission for forestry projects to register under both schemes simultaneously.\nThis allowance, buried in the methodologies of both mechanisms, creates what carbon accounting experts call \"double-counting. When a single tree can generate both a Carbon Credit Certificate (CCC) for its carbon sequestration value and a Green Credit (GCs) for its physical existence, we're essentially allowing the same environmental benefit to be claimed twice. This isn't just an accounting quirk but it's a fundamental threat to India's climate credibility.\nTwo Credits, One Tree\nThe problem stems from the fact that these programmes measure environmental value differently. Under CCTS, forestry projects earn CCCs based on verified greenhouse gas removal, measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. A well-managed forest plantation might sequester 1,000 tonnes of CO₂ over its lifetime, generating 1,000 tradable carbon credits. Meanwhile, the same project earns Green Credits under GCP, one credit for each tree that survives beyond five years, provided the land parcel achieves a minimum canopy density of 40% over a 5-hectare area.\nOn paper, these seem complementary. In practice, they create perverse incentives. A corporate entity could use CCCs to claim carbon neutrality in its sustainability reporting while simultaneously using GCs from the same trees to fulfil compensatory afforestation obligations or Corporate Social Responsibility requirements. The same environmental action, i.e., planting and maintaining trees, gets counted multiple times across different compliance frameworks.\nThis matters because carbon markets only work when credits represent real, additional, and unique climate benefits. When Shell Oil claimed carbon neutrality partly through forest offsets that were also being counted by governments in their national climate pledges, the credibility of voluntary carbon markets took a severe hit. India risks repeating this mistake on its own soil.\nMethodological Confusion\nThe conflict deepens when examining how credits are calculated under each scheme. CCTS forestry methodologies adhere to conventional carbon accounting principles, including establishing baselines, proving additionality, and projecting sequestration over defined crediting periods. These can be either 10-year fixed terms or renewable 5-year cycles, with credits potentially issued based on projected carbon uptake.\nThe GCP takes an entirely different approach. It waits 5 years to verify tree survival and canopy density before issuing any credits. The focus is on ecological restoration outcomes, and only trees that survive the five-year threshold count toward credit generation. However, this methodology is heavily contested by ecologists.\nThese timing mismatches create obvious problems. A CCTS project might claim early-stage carbon sequestration credits while the same trees haven't yet qualified for GCs. Later, when those trees mature and canopy density increases, they also generate GCs. There's no mechanism to reconcile these different timelines or measurement approaches, leaving project developers to navigate conflicting standards without clear guidance.\nWhere Credits Flow\nUnderstanding where these credits ultimately end up makes the concern about double-counting even more pressing. CCCs serve as both compliance and offset instruments in India's carbon market, purchased by obligated entities that fail to meet their emission intensity targets. These credits trade on CERC-approved power exchanges and can be banked for future compliance years or sold to other obligated entities.\nGCs, though non-tradable and non-transferable, can be exchanged once for compensatory afforestation requirements, CSR obligations, or project compliance. While they can't be sold on exchanges like CCCs, they still represent valuable compliance currency for businesses that need to offset their environmental impacts, especially by virtually purchasing forest carbon sequestration.\nThe Indian Carbon Market operates as a closed domestic system, with no linkages to international carbon markets yet. This isolation, while protecting against external manipulation, also means there's no international oversight to catch double-counting problems. The burden falls entirely on domestic regulators to ensure integrity.\nBridging the Gap\nThe solution isn't to eliminate dual registration; the GCP and CCTS seemingly serve different policy objectives. However, the government must urgently address three critical gaps.\nFirst, establish explicit mechanisms to prevent double-counting. If a forestry project generates CCCs based on carbon sequestration, those trees' GCs should perhaps be discounted proportionally, or vice versa. Alternatively, clear guidelines should mandate separate accounting for claims made under each scheme, preventing companies from using both credits toward overlapping compliance obligations.\nSecond, harmonise methodologies where possible. While the programmes measure different things, their verification standards, baseline establishment procedures, and monitoring requirements should align to reduce developer confusion and improve transparency.\nThird, strengthen reporting requirements. Any entity claiming environmental benefits from projects registered under both schemes must disclose this dual registration and clearly delineate which benefits are attributed to which credits. This transparency enables stakeholders to evaluate whether environmental claims are legitimate or exaggerated.\nThe Credibility Cost\nIndia's climate ambitions are substantial, reaching net-zero emissions by 2070 requires mobilising massive private investment into carbon reduction and removal projects. Domestic carbon markets and green credit systems are essential tools for channelling that capital efficiently. But these markets only function if participants trust that credits represent genuine, non-duplicated environmental benefits.\nThe double-counting loophole, if left unaddressed, risks eroding this trust before India's carbon market even matures. International investors, corporate buyers, and civil society watchdogs are increasingly sophisticated in detecting carbon accounting irregularities. India cannot afford to have its domestic climate instruments dismissed as greenwashing vehicles.\n(Shashank Pandey is a lawyer.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stance of this publication.",

        "full_content": "The next phase of India’s climate story will be written not in carbon targets, but in resilient infrastructure and supply chains built to withstand extremes. Studies cited by the Reserve Bank of India estimate that rising heat stress and reduced labour productivity could shave off up to 4.5% of India’s GDP by 2030. Recent heatwaves and localised floods have already disrupted manufacturing clusters and strained urban systems, offering a preview of what lies ahead. Yet adaptation—strengthening systems to withstand these shocks—still receives only a fraction of global climate finance.\nEmission Cuts vs. Adaptation\nIndia today faces a stark paradox. While global negotiations remain focused on emission reductions, the country’s near-term growth already depends on how well it adapts to a hotter, more volatile climate. The UN Environment Programme’s latest Adaptation Gap Report places adaptation costs for developing countries at about US$215 billion per year this decade, rising to nearly US$387 billion annually when countries’ stated priorities are fully included. India’s own Initial Adaptation Communication to the UN climate convention estimates a cumulative adaptation finance requirement of approximately US$673 billion by 2030 to climate-proof agriculture, water systems, infrastructure, and urban development. Despite these needs, most finance continues to flow toward mitigation, leaving a widening gap between climate risks and investment.\nThe Adaptation Economy\nFor business, this imbalance is both a risk and an opportunity. The emerging “adaptation economy” spans infrastructure retrofits, climate-smart agriculture, water security, resilient supply chains, and new forms of climate-linked finance. As Asia becomes the epicentre of climate exposure, India is positioned to lead and capture a meaningful share of what could be a US$600 billion to US$1 trillion global market for climate-resilience solutions by 2030, according to emerging assessments of resilience technologies and services. The message is clear: adaptation is no longer peripheral to growth; it is central to maintaining economic momentum in a decade defined by climate disruption.\nInvesting in Resilience\nThis opportunity is hiding in plain sight. Global adaptation finance for developing countries falls short by an estimated US$200–400 billion annually. This mismatch between risk and investment is why adaptation has become a business issue, not merely a government concern. Large empirical studies by the World Resources Institute, examining hundreds of adaptation projects across countries, show average economic internal rates of return of nearly 27%, with every dollar invested generating more than ten dollars in benefits over a decade. Resilience, in other words, is an investment class waiting to be mainstreamed.\nTechnological Innovation and Financial Tools\nAdaptation is fundamentally the business of continuity. It keeps supply chains functional during extreme weather, allows cities and factories to operate despite floods and heatwaves, and protects workers and consumers in a hotter climate. In infrastructure, this means flood-resistant roads, heat-resilient buildings, and stormwater systems designed for new rainfall patterns. In agriculture, it includes drought-tolerant seeds, climate-indexed insurance, and digital advisory tools that help farmers and food companies manage volatility. In water management, it ranges from desalination and aquifer recharge to mangrove restoration and integrated river-basin planning.\nTechnology and finance are enabling a quiet shift in how resilience is built. Indian startups are developing AI-based early-warning systems, satellite-driven crop analytics, and IoT sensors that provide real-time climate data to insurers, utilities, logistics operators, and municipal planners. On the financial side, parametric insurance— which automatically triggers payouts when defined climate thresholds are breached—is gaining traction. Development institutions and governments are also experimenting with resilience bonds and blended-finance instruments to crowd in private capital for climate-proof infrastructure. The Reserve Bank of India’s increasing emphasis on climate-risk disclosure signals that resilience will soon influence lending decisions, asset valuations, and corporate creditworthiness.\nIndia’s Policy Evolution and Global Shifts\nAsia is warming at roughly twice the global average, according to the World Meteorological Organization, making it the world’s ground zero for climate risk. For India, the stakes are especially high. More than half the population remains dependent on climate-sensitive sectors, and even short periods of extreme heat or erratic rainfall can ripple across food prices, health systems, and industrial output. S&P Global estimates that nearly 60% of India’s listed companies face material physical climate risk by mid-century, underscoring how deeply adaptation will shape future competitiveness.\nIndia’s policy environment is evolving in response. Work is underway on the country’s first National Adaptation Plan, led by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The government has described the plan as a forthcoming national blueprint to embed climate resilience across agriculture, water, infrastructure, health, and coastal protection. This builds on existing pillars such as state climate action plans, heat-action planning, resilient infrastructure missions, and long-term low-emissions strategies that increasingly incorporate adaptation.\nThe outcomes of COP30 in Belém further reinforce this direction. The summit marked a decisive global shift toward adaptation, with countries agreeing to triple adaptation finance by 2035 and accelerate implementation under the Global Goal on Adaptation. These decisions reflect India’s long-standing emphasis on equitable, grant-based finance and recognition of the development needs of emerging economies. For Indian businesses, the signal is unmistakable: future climate finance flows, risk metrics, and investment frameworks will increasingly prioritise resilience and physical risk management. Companies that build early capabilities—whether by assessing asset-level climate risks, upgrading infrastructure, adopting new technologies, or partnering with governments—will be better positioned to attract capital and withstand volatility.\nConclusion: Adaptation as Strategic Necessity\nAdaptation may not command the glamour of net-zero targets, but it determines whether economies like India’s can sustain growth in a world defined by disruption. For corporates, this is no longer about altruism; it is a strategic necessity. Those that invest in resilient operations, products, and supply chains will be the ones to withstand future shocks and shape new market opportunities. The adaptation economy is no longer hidden; it is the foundation of future value creation. For India, leading on adaptation offers not just protection from climate risks, but the opportunity to innovate and build the solutions that a warming world urgently needs.\n(Suryaprabha Sadasivan, Senior Vice President, Chase Advisors.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stance of this publication.",

        "full_content": "As India continues its strategic courtship with several other like-minded developing countries for critical mineral partnership, the emerging architecture is becoming a defining pillar of its geopolitical and industrial strategy.\nIndia’s near-total import dependence on energy transition minerals casts a shadow on supply chain resilience when seen from the dovetailed lenses of geopolitics and its weaponsiation by some countries through export restrictions and more. The dominant policy conversations now revolve around diversification which has become both a mantra and a metric of energy security.\nFrequently, delegation-level talks especially between India and mineral rich regions like African and Latin American countries and India have been making news for acquisition of ores for digging. These are now widely interpreted as tangible evidence of India’s intent to strategically diversify its critical mineral supply base and reduce overdependence on single-source geographies like China for Graphite and Neodymium-Iron-Boron (NdFeB) magnets, both crucial ingredients for electric vehicles, wind turbines, etc., among others.\nBehind the Numbers: The rise of re-export hubs\nAn assessment of India’s critical minerals’ import data recently undertaken by the author shows a mirage-esque situation. The data showed that a portion of India’s so-called diversification is actually routed not through resource-owning states but through re-export hubs like Belgium and Hong Kong (HK) which process or merely redistribute minerals originating elsewhere. The result is a deceptive map of supply chains that projects resilience while masking the very dependencies India seeks to escape.\nBelgium is a striking example. India's trade statistics show growing cobalt imports from Brussels. Imports rose from ₹15.5 crore (~ USD 1.9 million) for ~85,400 kg in 2021 to a peak of ₹51.8 crore (~USD 6.2 million) in 2022 (172,000 kg), before tapering to ₹21.4 crore (~ USD 2.6 million) in 2024. It is important to note that Belgium has no domestic reserves whatsoever and it is the second largest refiner of cobalt in Europe.\nWhat India is importing, therefore, is not cobalt originating in Belgium, but Belgium itself sourcing directly from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) whose majority of mines are Chinese-owned and controlled. The DRC’s cobalt sector is well-documented for systemic governance risks, including labour exploitation, artisanal and informal mining dependency, opaque concessions, and severe environmental impacts.\nLayers of costs and risks\nThe premium prices India pays, often several times the raw-material cost, reflects midstream value capture abroad. This three-way relationship also exposes India to the shifting geopolitical calculus between DRC and Belgium, effectively placing its supply chain at the mercy of external political, regulatory, and industrial shifts beyond its control. In turn, it also adds another layer of vulnerability due to Europe’s tightening ESG norms.\nHong Kong is China’s workaround\nHong Kong is another illustration of a geo-economic buffer that China has adopted as a strategy and it presents as a diversification node for India. Cerium oxides are used in catalytic converters, fuel cells and hydrogen-related applications. China’s cerium exports to India dropped in 2023 (from ~110,000 kg in 2022 to ~178,000 kg in 2023) which reflects that they used HK as a re-shipment hub. Additionally, the dip in volume from China exactly mirrors the increase in Hong Kong imports for that time period.\nThe import value for HK is reported at nil despite huge shipments. This is because trade data only captures the port of export and not the payment partner, further corroborating the findings. There are other countries with a similar trajectory, however, deeper research is needed to ascertain the same.\nDiversification as strategy and illusion\nAcross these nodes, the pattern repeats: intermediary trading partners mask the true origin of minerals, and inflates India’s sense of security and supply chain resilience. Such practices create double dependency structures where India is indirectly tethered not only to China’s dominance but also to the political and trade dynamics of the intermediary state.\nIf geopolitical dynamics shift, for instance, if relations between DRC and Belgium sour, or if India’s own tensions with China deepen, the stability of these mineral flows could be jeopardised from multiple directions. In such a scenario, India’s access to cobalt and similar processed materials would face heightened risk.\nLayered onto this are growing trends of tariffs, sanctions, export controls, and resource nationalism, all of which are now commonplace in the global critical mineral theatre. Together, these forces create a complex web of exposure that weakens India’s bargaining position and limits its strategic flexibility. At the outset, this is not diversification, rather a trend of outsourcing vulnerability into a more complex, and therefore harder to detect form.\nJourney is equally important as the destination\nThis phenomenon is not a statistical quirk, it is a structural market behaviour shaped by logistics and strategic information asymmetries. For India, the implications are profound.\nFirst, policy suffers if diversification indices treat Belgium or Hong Kong as independent supply sources, then India’s import portfolio appears healthier than it truly is, obscuring the underlying problems. Second, these hubs distort pricing and bargaining power. This locks India into a passive buyer role while other nations build strategic reserves, invest in beneficiation, and shape global standards for traceability and sustainability.\nThe deeper threat is, then, normative: re-export hubs make India believe it has hedged against geopolitical risk when in reality it has only multiplied the number of actors who can constrain its access. In doing so, the risk is diluted, not reduced. And diluted risk in the critical minerals landscape behaves like invisible debt, it accumulates quietly until the moment of crisis.\nOrigin is the key\nWhat is required is a shift from import diversification to origin authentication. India must insist on end-to-end provenance through mechanisms such as Battery Aadhaar, bilateral customs-data exchange, and harmonised origin-reporting standards. Only then can policymakers distinguish genuine suppliers from intermediaries.\nIndia also needs to develop its own refining and midstream capacity through robust measures under National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM) and recover from recycling. Without domestic midstream infrastructure, India will always be vulnerable to the pricing power and strategic preferences of re-export hubs.\nThe clean-energy transition requires minerals, but minerals require governance, transparency, and strategic foresight. Unless India recognises the mirage of re-export diversification and confronts it head-on, the country risks building its energy future on unstable foundations. In the geopolitics of critical minerals, the map is never the territory. And unless India reads the map correctly, the path to energy security will remain more fragile than it appears.\n(Meheli Roy Choudhury is a Research Consultant at Chintan Research Foundation.)\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

Narela is recording an AQI of 492, and Okhla Phase 2 is recording an AQI of 474.

With \"Satisfactory\" category, air quality remains acceptable, although sensitive groups such as children, the elderly, and individuals with respiratory conditions may experience slight discomfort.\nThe \"Moderate\" category, ranging from 101 to 200, indicates increasing pollution levels that may trigger respiratory difficulties among individuals with asthma, other lung conditions, or heart disease.\nProlonged exposure to \"Poor\" air can cause breathing discomfort to most people, not just those with pre-existing health issues.\nThis level has become increasingly common in several parts of the capital during winter.\nLevels between 301 and 400 are classified as \"Very Poor\" and pose a risk of respiratory illness, even among healthy individuals, when exposure persists for extended periods. The most hazardous category, \"Severe,\" includes AQI values from 401 to 500. At this stage, air quality becomes dangerous for everyone.",

        "full_content": "Despite clear evidence that plastic is clogging oceans and beaches and breaking down into microplastics that enter our bodies, humans are continuing to produce the material at accelerating rates.\nThe result: Global plastic pollution will hit 280 million metric tons per year by 2040, or a dump truck’s worth every second.\nThat is one of the alarming statistics from Breaking the Plastic Wave 2025, a report by the Pew Charitable Trusts with ICF International. It offers a comprehensive assessment of plastic pollution and its effect on human health and the environment.\nIn August, talks to forge an international treaty to rein in plastic pollution collapsed as countries that produce the majority of the material blocked proposals to limit the amount of new plastic created. Meanwhile, recycling rates have remained low.\nThe new report is a bit of a hybrid. It compiles data from recent research and then runs it through a model to predict outcomes under different policy scenarios. Winnie Lau, director of Pew’s Preventing Ocean Plastics project and one of the authors, said the team “wanted to pull it all together in one integrated analysis to look at impacts across the board.”\nPew published a similar report in 2020, but it limited the scope then to pollution from consumer-facing plastics like packaging that end up in solid waste systems. This report looks far beyond that to include “hidden” plastics, including those used in the construction, agriculture and transportation sectors.\nIf the world continues on the current trajectory, the outlook for 2040 is bleak, the report warns. Global production of new plastic is set to increase by 52%, twice as much as waste-management systems. Plastic-related greenhouse gas emissions are expected to surge by 58%, to 4.2 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year — enough that, if plastic production were a country, it would be the current third-largest emitter. At the root of the problem is the fact that plastics are mostly derived from fossil fuels.\nThere are some 16,000 different chemicals in plastics and scientists have identified more than one fourth of those as possibly harmful to human health. In the five years since the last Pew report, a wave of research has attempted to understand in particular how a class of chemicals known as endocrine disruptors, widely used in makeup and cookware, may affect digestive, reproductive and cognitive function.\nPew also modeled the global health impacts associated with the making and disposal of plastic (excluding microplastics) and related pollution. The authors estimate the world’s population will lose 5.6 million total years of healthy life in 2025 and 9.8 million years in 2040. Primary plastic production accounts for the majority of this via links to cancers and respiratory diseases.\nCountries and communities already have tools at their disposal to reduce the manufacture and use of plastics drastically. They could mandate better product and packaging design and invest in infrastructure to support reuse. (Think of how milkmen would once deliver bottles of milk while carting away the used ones for cleaning and refilling.)\nIn Pew’s ideal scenario, subsidies for plastic production would be eliminated and waste collection would be greatly expanded. If that happened, nearly 100% of consumer packaging could be collected and recycling rates could double, the authors write.\nBut even under perfect conditions, they concede, microplastics would be much harder to control. The main sources of microplastics are vehicle tire dust, paint and agriculture-related products — for example, fertilizer sold in plastic pods that dissolve into soil and plastic sheeting that is used for mulch. There are few straightforward substitutes for these materials.\nAmong Pew’s recommendations are decreasing overall plastic production, using safer chemicals and taking targeted actions to reduce the shedding of microplastics. One anti-plastics group welcomed the report. “We need laws that require fewer toxic chemicals in plastic and less plastic production, and we applaud Pew for prioritizing those measures,” said Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics and a former Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator.\nHowever, Enck said the authors were overly optimistic in projecting that plastic recycling would grow substantially with different policies in place.\n“There’s a good reason why the plastics recycling rate has never reached double digits,” she said. “It’s because its chemical and polymer complexity makes large-scale recycling technically and economically infeasible. We’re wasting valuable time by relying on a system that has not worked for decades.”",

        "full_content": "India’s data centre sector is poised for a massive expansion, driven by the country’s growing digital needs. However, as data centres consume vast amounts of energy—nearly half of which goes into cooling the servers—sustainability must be at the forefront of this growth. One promising solution is repurposing the waste heat generated by these facilities. By capturing, redirecting, and monetizing this heat, India can blend growth with sustainability.\nThe Data Centre Landscape in India\nData centres are large facilities that house servers and other computing equipment. These buildings contain racks of CPUs (Central Processing Units) and GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), the latter of which excel at the parallel processing needed for AI and scientific workloads. With India’s data traffic surging, the country now hosts roughly 276 operational data centres (private) and 41 government (4-Large and 37 small) data centres nationwide. Along with hardware, this expansion will require robust networking infrastructure and renewable energy sources to meet the growing demand, which is projected to rise by 40-45 TWh.\nIndia’s data centre hubs—Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai, Delhi-NCR, and Pune—have high energy demands. But India’s relatively low build cost ($7 per watt compared to $10 in the U.S.) makes it a hotspot for global data centre investment. The challenge, however, is ensuring that this expansion is sustainable by reducing emissions, using renewables, and utilizing waste heat.\nLeveraging Waste Heat for Industrial Use\nData centres can become multi-purpose assets, not only powering digital operations but also providing heat for industrial purposes. By embedding waste heat recovery systems, companies can repurpose the heat for uses like textile dyeing, cement drying, food processing, and greenhouse farming. This dual-use approach reduces energy costs and emissions while benefiting adjacent industries.\nIndustrial clusters and data centres can form a symbiotic relationship. By co-locating data centres near manufacturing hubs, companies can create efficient, sustainable, and resource-sharing ecosystems. This partnership can transform data centres from digital-only assets into multi-utility hubs, where waste heat supports both digital and industrial operations.\nFor example, excess heat from data centres could support logistics and supply chain operations by providing energy to nearby industrial facilities. By embedding waste heat recovery into every stage of data centre operations, India can lead the world in green data centres, turning an environmental challenge into an economic opportunity.\nGlobal Insights: Learning from Europe’s Success\nNorthern Europe, particularly the Nordic countries, is a global leader in data centre heat reuse. Countries like Sweden, Norway, and Denmark have integrated waste heat from data centres into their industrial and urban infrastructure. In Sweden, for example, a 1 MW data centre supplies heat to a greenhouse, significantly reducing operational costs. Similarly, in Norway, the heat from servers is used to warm water for lobster and trout farms, creating a circular system where excess heat cools the data centre and vice versa.\nIn the UK, a company uses server waste heat to warm swimming pools, while in Denmark, Copenhagen’s district heating system serves over 600,000 households, with data centres integrated into the grid. These examples show how data centres can be transformed from energy-intensive facilities into sustainable utilities for both industry and communities.\nFor India, these models offer valuable lessons. The country’s cold winters and industrial needs make it an ideal candidate for leveraging data centre waste heat for applications like textile processing, food production, greenhouse farming, and district heating. Co-location planning is key: a new data centre should ideally be located near industries that can utilize its waste heat, such as in regions with existing manufacturing clusters.\nTransforming Waste Heat into Cooling Energy\nIndia’s hot climate makes cooling the primary challenge for industries like cold storage, food supply chains, and pharmaceuticals. Data centres, however, generate large amounts of waste heat that can be transformed into cooling energy. Technologies like absorption chillers, adsorption systems, and trigeneration setups can convert this waste heat into chilled water or refrigeration, enabling data centres to support cold chain logistics, refrigerated warehouses, and other temperature-sensitive industries.\nBy embedding this waste heat into industrial clusters and smart cities, companies can create circular energy loops where digital intelligence drives both computation and cooling. This would reduce electricity demand for refrigeration, lower carbon footprints, and strengthen resilience in supply chains.\nApplications of Waste Heat\nAdditionally, waste heat from data centres can also be repurposed for: industrial pre-heating for textiles, dairy, and food processing; thermal desalination in coastal cities; greenhouses and polyhouses for year-round farming; aquaculture to maintain warm water for fisheries; seed drying and grain storage to reduce post-harvest losses and absorption chillers for cooling commercial complexes. These applications can turn heat into a valuable resource, improving sustainability and reducing energy waste.\nStrategic Planning and Policy Support\nFor India to tap into the potential of waste heat from data centres, a strategic planning approach is required. The first step is to map out industrial clusters and existing data centres across the country. Platforms like PM GatiShakti, the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), and the National Master Plan (NMP) provide geospatial data and infrastructure insights that can help identify optimal locations for new data centres. By aligning data centres with industrial hubs, renewable energy sources, and urban consumption centres, India can create cost-efficient, sustainable energy loops.\nConclusion\nIndia’s data centre boom need not be solely about expanding digital infrastructure. By capturing and repurposing waste heat, these centres can become dual-purpose assets that power both computation and industrial processes. This integration of waste heat into the industrial and urban landscape will foster efficiency, sustainability, and resilience across the economy. With the right planning and policy foresight, India can lead globally in green data centres, turning an environmental challenge into an economic opportunity.\n(Ateesh Kumar Singh, Joint Secretary at Ministry of MSME.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stance of this publication.",

        "full_content": "When the Amazon climate summit ended in Belém, delegates carried home ambiguity, something that could be seen as worse than outright failure. After two weeks of talks in the gateway city to the world’s largest rainforest, nearly 200 countries produced a Belém Political Package that looked substantive on paper, but was a collection of frameworks that postponed hard questions rather than answer them.\nHost Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva had set expectations high during the opening. “We are moving in the right direction but at the wrong speed,” he had said. By the time negotiators left town, they had demonstrated precisely how right he was.\nWhat the annual climate talks, also known as COP30, needed to deliver was clarity on three fronts -- how the world would finance the transition away from fossil fuels, whether wealthy nations would finally make good on adaptation promises, and how verification could work without becoming another burden on the poor. The summit produced pledges on all three, but it produced certainty on none.\nThat gap between promise and action was the real outcome of the UN climate summit. Markets needed certainty to allocate capital to mitigate or adapt to the climate crisis. However, COP30 left financial systems wondering where capital should go.\nUnanswered trillion dollar question\nThe roadmap to mobilize $1.3 trillion annually in climate finance by 2035 had been the summit’s centrepiece before negotiations began two week ago. The Baku-to-Belém Roadmap was supposed to reform multilateral development banks, reduce debt burdens on vulnerable countries, and channel private capital at scale. What COP30 delivered was that same roadmap with the most critical questions left exactly where they started.\nThis fundamental problem sits at the core of climate finance design. Private investors chase returns. They pour capital into renewable energy and carbon trading because those activities generate profits. The most urgent climate needs in developing nations generate no profits. Adaptation work, or building flood defences, creating drought-resistant crops, establishing early-warning systems, produces no financial returns. Yet these are precisely where poor countries need resources the most.\nAccording to the World Resources Institute, which called the roadmap “one of the most comprehensive attempts yet” to align global financial architecture with climate needs, private investors would shy away from adaptation work. No agreement emerged during COP30 on how to bridge that gap or on how much public money wealthy nations would commit.\nDeveloped nations argued that all countries with capacity should contribute. Developing nations countered that rich countries bore historical responsibility and must lead. Neither side moved. Instead, negotiators moved finance discussions into “presidency consultations,” which is diplomatic language for postponement.\nFor corporations planning billion-dollar investments in adaptation infrastructure or green technology, this creates a problem. Climate finance remains speculative rather than investment-grade. Companies cannot reliably forecast capital flows to emerging markets or predict interest rates. They cannot determine which countries will have resources to absorb climate shocks without disrupting supply chains. Corporate capital will stay cautious after the Brazil summit.\nFossil fuel standoff\nThe summit’s most visible failure concerned fossil fuels. More than 80 countries had pushed for a detailed global roadmap on how quickly the world would abandon oil, gas and coal. Brazil supported the idea and secured widespread backing. Yet even that modest goal proved too contentious.\nResistance from major fossil fuel producers pared back this ambition considerably. What remained was only general language urging transition in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement, with no timeline, pace specification, or enforcement mechanisms.\nMary Robinson, former President of Ireland and a climate advocate, captured the disappointment. “While very disappointingly countries failed to agree on a collective roadmap to phase out fossil fuels or end deforestation, the global direction of travel is clear,” she said. “This deal isn't perfect and is far from what science requires.”\nFor energy strategists at multinationals, this represented the summit’s core weakness. Companies needed coordinated signals from governments. They needed to know whether their strategies would align with the global trajectory or whether each economy would be writing its own energy policy. COP30 left that unresolved.\nWhat emerged instead was commitment to develop a just transition mechanism, a platform for sharing knowledge about shifting away from fossil fuels. But the mechanism produces no capital. “We celebrate the decision to develop the just transition mechanism. We leave Belém with a historic victory for people power, but a devastating failure of political will from the Global North to deliver climate ambition and finance,” said Harjeet Singh, Founding Director of the Satat Sampada Climate Foundation. “Without strong public funding, the transition to a greener future remains a mirage.\"\nTrade tensions surrounding fossil fuels also remained unresolved. The European Union has implemented carbon border adjustment mechanisms. The United States is moving toward similar measures. Developing nations view tariffs as protectionism wearing a climate mask. No framework was worked out to manage the intersection of climate policy and trade rules. For supply chain strategists, this means assuming trade fragmentation rather than harmonization.\nAdaptation promises without timelines\nThe summit promised to triple adaptation finance to roughly $120 billion annually by 2035 and formalised within the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance. The pledge looked substantial until examined. First, the timeline is distant. Countries facing escalating heatwaves, floods and droughts need resources now, not a decade away.\n“Wealthy nations continue to dodge responsibility, pushing loans over grants and refusing clear commitments for a fossil fuel phase-out, deepening the trust deficit,” said Shailendra Yashwant, Senior Advisor at Climate Action Network South Asia. “What South Asia and other regions require is urgent, grant-based, accessible finance that reaches communities now.”\nSecond, accountability remains absent. “The goal of tripling adaptation finance remains vague with no specific accountability of contributors,” said Avantika Goswami, Programme Manager of Climate Change at the Centre for Science and Environment. The 2009 promise of $100 billion in annual climate finance did never fully met on schedule. New promises rest on a track record of broken commitments.\nThird, the funding gap is enormous. The summit announced $135 million for the adaptation fund and $300 million for Brazil's health action plan to protect clinics from climate risks. These sums are small against actual adaptation needs. For companies with supply chains in agricultural regions, healthcare systems or water-stressed areas, this underinvestment means operational risk persists. Farmers without drought-resistant seeds will lose harvests, hospitals without climate-resilient infrastructure will collapse during heatwaves.\nLoss and damage trap\nThe summit did take some incremental steps for the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage, which has been designed to help countries recover from climate disasters. Structurally, this represented progress. But access remained limited. Vulnerable nations wanted the fund to work quickly with guaranteed contributions. Donor countries wanted to move cautiously and assess applications case by case. COP30 produced no mechanism bridging these positions.\nAvinash Persaud, senior advisor to the Inter-American Development Bank, identified the core problem. “The world fell short on more rapid release grants for developing countries responding to loss and damage,” he said. “That goal is as urgent as it is hard.”\nWhen disaster strikes, governments need cash within weeks. The current system operates on timescales measured in months or years. This gap creates economic uncertainty. For multinational corporations, if disaster funds arrive late, local suppliers would lack working capital, which could lead to stopped production, faltering delivery falters and rising costs.\nNo consensus emerged during COP30 on how countries should strengthen national climate plans before submitting new versions in 2025. The World Resources Institute had released sobering research in its State of Climate Action 2025 report. No major economic sector is moving fast enough to limit warming to safer levels, it had said. Research from the Climate Action Tracker had showed that current national plans would still lead to dangerous warming even if every country kept every promise.\nCOP30 left these questions unresolved. Some nations wanted binding commitments and strict review standards. Others wanted flexibility. The underlying tension persisted at the end of the summit. This means 2025 national plans will likely repeat patterns of recent decades, which could translate into ambitious language with inadequate commitments and persistent gaps between what science requires and what policy delivers.\nWhat businesses must understand\nCOP30 edged the world forward, but not decisively. For corporate leaders, the message was unambiguous. They cannot assume policy certainty exists where it does not. They will be compelled to build scenario planning into climate commitments and assume policy fragmentation rather than harmonization.\nThree critical gaps remained unresolved. First, finance clarity never materialized. No one knows how much money will actually flow and when. The roadmap to $1.3 trillion exists as aspiration, not specification. Second, trade frameworks remained absent. No governance mechanism exists for managing carbon tariffs and climate-related trade measures. Third, verification with accountability never emerged. Transparency demands multiplied, while funding commitments stalled.\nThe real test would arrive in 2025, when countries submit new national climate plans. If those plans break the pattern of disappointing ambition, climate action may find momentum. If they repeat history, corporate climate strategies should assume policy fragmentation will persist.\nSupply chain resilience requires local adaptation, not global coordination. ESG investors face continued alignment challenges between corporate targets and government reality. Capital allocation to climate action remains speculative until delivery mechanisms prove real rather than rhetorical.\nCOP30 was supposed to be the summit where the UN process shifted from intentions to implementation. Instead, it demonstrated once more that climate summits only postpone hard decisions. The next year will determine whether Belém was genuinely a turning point, or simply another missed moment. For now, the world remains suspended between hope and hesitation, and businesses must plan accordingly.",

        "full_content": "India has dropped to 23rd place in the Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI), slipping into the report’s “medium” category and losing ground after several years near the top. In the preceding report, India was ranked 10th and placed in the “high” category for overall performance.\nThe new ranking shows rising emissions and slow growth in renewable energy holding the country back.\nThe index, released on 18 November by Germanwatch, NewClimate Institute and Climate Action Network International, rated countries on greenhouse-gas trends, renewable energy, energy use and climate policy. India scored well on energy use per person and on some long-term emissions indicators, but earned a low rating for the share of renewables in its total energy supply and only a medium rating for climate policy. Those factors explain most of the fall, the report said.\nIndia’s slide reflects “steady emissions growth and the lack of a clear plan to end new coal projects,” said Jan Burck of Germanwatch, co-author of the report. India could climb back up the rankings if it slows bringing in new coal to generate electricity and keeps expanding clean energy.\nThe report arrived as negotiators at the UN climate summit (COP30) in Belém in Brazil were close to the finish line. India has made progress in installing solar parks and improving energy efficiency, the CCPI said. But it stressed that the country’s overall energy system is still dominated by coal, and that no national deadline exists to reduce or eventually stop building coal power plants. The authors called for clear timelines and stronger policy signals across sectors.\nIndia’s climate vulnerability\nIndia’s vulnerability to the climate crisis adds pressure to improve its performance. The Climate Risk Index, also published by Germanwatch, listed India among the countries most affected by extreme weather over the past three decades. Floods, heatwaves, cyclones and landslides have caused deaths and billions of dollars in economic losses. The new CCPI said this risk should be central to India’s climate planning.\nScientific evidence has reinforced the concern. A recent study warned that oppressive heatwaves, or periods when heat and humidity together become dangerous, could increase sharply in India as the planet warms. Another study showed residential cooling demand is rising fast in India, and is likely to grow even more unless buildings become more efficient and electricity becomes cleaner.\nThe UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2025 warned that even if all countries meet their current promises, the world is still heading for around 2.3 to 2.5 degrees Celsius of warming this century. The CCPI report said no country was on track for the 1.5-degree goal, and once again left the top three spots on the table empty.\nThe world is at a “turning point,” said Niklas Höhne of the NewClimate Institute, another CCPI author. Global emissions must start dropping quickly to avoid severe impacts, Höhne said. His warning underscored the limits of India’s current pace.\nIndian climate activists were varied in their reactions to the new ranking. “India has a good chance to improve this ranking by preparing a clear-cut coal phase-out plan and facilitating a people-centric just transition plan that not only reduces emissions, but also takes care of inclusive approaches to ecological restoration and economic revival,” said Ranjan Panda, Convenor, Combat Climate Change Network.\nA coal phase-out plan refers to a step-by-step schedule to reduce and eventually end coal use. A just transition means supporting workers and communities during the shift to clean energy.\nNarrow lens of coal usage\n“It is hypocritical to judge India through a narrow lens of coal usage without acknowledging that we are supporting 1.5 billion lives on a fraction of the energy consumed by the West,” said Harjeet Singh, Founding Director, Satat Sampada Climate Foundation. “The world needs a faster phase-out of fossil fuels, but it must be led and funded by wealthy nations, not forced.”\nPublic funding remains critical, according to Janet Milongo of Climate Action Network International. “Energy inequity continues to be a reality for many people in the world,” she said, arguing that more grant-based finance was needed to help countries shift to renewable energy.\nFor India, the latest CCPI results carry both risks and opportunities. They show that the country has strengths, especially in emissions per person and energy use. But they also show that India’s clean-energy share is not rising fast enough to keep pace with growing demand.\nAs COP30 negotiators in Brazil push toward an action outcome before the scheduled end of the summit on 21 November, India has called for more climate finance, more access to clean-energy technology and stronger support for adaptation, or adjusting to the effect of climate change to minimize harm. At the same time, the report signalled that India will face growing pressure to outline a clear path away from coal and toward faster renewable-energy growth.\nThe CCPI is not an indicator of future progress, only of present momentum. But its message for India is direct. The country has the capacity to improve, and the consequences of slow action are already visible on the ground. The decisions taken in the next few years, and in the final hours at Belém, will shape whether India can climb back into the top tier of climate performers.",

        "full_content": "A report released earlier this week showed developing countries, excluding China, need $2.4 trillion annually by 2030, climbing to about $3.2 trillion by 2035. The fourth assessment from the Independent High-Level Expert Group on Climate Finance (IHLEG) at the London School of Economics arrived soon after soon after negotiators gathered in Belém for the annual UN climate summit (COP30).\nIt confirmed what many had suspected. The targets agreed last year fall far short of actual requirements. Last year’s climate meet set an aspirational goal of $1.3 trillion each year by 2035. Wealthy nations committed to provide $300 billion to developing countries, with the remainder expected from emerging economies and private investors. It is clear that the gap between aspiration and documented need is substantial.\nArunabha Ghosh, chief executive of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), argued the framing itself is flawed. Climate finance represents economic necessity, not charity, he said. Without rethinking how markets and governments approach this, climate action will likely stall. The central problem is capital allocation. Money exists in global markets. It simply refuses to flow where most needed.\nNicholas Stern of the London School of Economics, who co-authored the assessment, addressed this directly. “Private finance will not flow at scale without public risk-sharing,” he said. Public money must move first, building confidence to unlock trillions parked in capital markets.\nThe barriers are well documented. Projects in emerging markets carry risk perceptions that often exceed reality. International finance retains systematic biases against developing economies. Countries requiring the largest investments face the highest capital costs, creating a self-reinforcing constraint.\nIndian illustration\nIndia illustrates how this operates in practice. Research from the Centre for Social and Economic Progress estimates that India needs roughly $467 billion by 2030, concentrated in the steel, cement, power and transport sectors. Each presents distinct challenges.\nIndia has amply demonstrated that capital moves when the conditions are right. Renewable energy, for instance, has attracted foreign investment successfully. Inflows have tripled over the past five years through fiscal 2025.\nThe financing structure reveals the current constraints. Equity capital flows into renewable projects where India permits full foreign ownership, but debt creates a bottleneck. Banks face sectoral exposure limits, restricting how much they can lend to specific industries.\nArjun Dutt, who leads climate finance work at CEEW, identified one mechanism that could help. “Introducing a carve out for renewable energy in the credit enhancement facility for corporate infrastructure bonds announced in the last Union Budget could help stimulate the domestic green bond market,” he said. Refinancing existing loans through bond markets would free banking capital for new projects. These tools work better when they are offered on concessional terms, Dutt said.\nHeavily polluting industries present a more difficult proposition. Steel and cement account for over 80% of India’s climate investment needs by 2030 because they require expensive technologies in order to decarbonise. The investment case here demands longer timeframes and patient capital willing to accept both technology and market risk.\nPragmatic approach required\nDutt suggested that India approaches its international commitments pragmatically. The voluntary commitments should be split into two, he said. Unconditional targets would reflect what the country can achieve using domestic resources and organic foreign capital flows. Conditional targets would be more ambitious, dependent on accessing affordable international climate finance.\nIn all scenarios, multilateral development banks remain central to any solution. However, it is evident that they are nowhere near ready for what is required. Assessments by the G20 and the World Bank itself show these institutions must triple their climate lending capacity to meet demand. Reforms to capital frameworks and new financing instruments might help. They will not be sufficient without deeper institutional transformation and sustained political backing.\nPolitics shape these discussions in ways technical assessments cannot capture. Amar Bhattacharya, a Brookings Institution fellow who co-authored the IHLEG report, acknowledged reaching even the $1.3 trillion target will be difficult despite being feasible. Recent political shifts have complicated matters. The US withdrawing from the Paris Agreement has contracted available climate finance, Bhattacharya said. He argued that this should not impede progress by other nations.\nDeveloping countries maintain that historical responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions justifies the burden falling on rich developed nations. They have been insisting at the climate conferences that finance should come without restrictive conditions that constrain development priorities. This approach reflects the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities embedded in international climate negotiations. It also reflects trust deficits accumulated over years of unfulfilled commitments.\nGap between intent and delivery\nThe loss and damage fund demonstrates the gap between stated intentions and actual delivery. Established at recent climate summits to support countries facing the severest climate impacts they contributed nothing to cause, the fund has collected pledges of $788.8 million as of mid-2025. For nations like Bangladesh and Pacific island states seeing significant climate losses, the sum represents a mere fraction of requirements.\nYamide Dagnet of the Natural Resources Defense Council sees potential in the fund’s structure, which focuses on country-owned solutions. The approach matters, she said. “We are at a turning point where we need to make the economic case for adaptation and loss and damage funding, as strong, if not stronger, than the business case for investment in clean energy growth pathways,” Dagnet said. The adaptation finance gap documented by the UN Environment Programme shows how little reaches the most vulnerable regions relative to demonstrated need.\nCurrent global climate finance flows total some $190 billion annually, according to the Climate Policy Initiative's 2024 figures. Reaching the $1.3 trillion target requires increasing flows nearly sevenfold within a decade, which is tough, if not impossible, task.\nThe arithmetic is straightforward. Execution demands mobilizing public finance, reforming multilateral institutions, reducing investment risk, and aligning competing national interests.\nAs negotiations continue in Belém, the test is whether countries can move from setting targets to building mechanisms that channel trillions where required. The decisions being made will shape economic trajectories for developing nations attempting to balance growth with emission reductions. They will determine whether climate finance becomes the transformation engine it needs to be, or remains another area where commitments exceed delivery.",

        "full_content": "Budgets are usually tallied in rupees, but Shaitan Singh Songira, a 44-year-old farmer from Rajasthan’s Sirohi district, demonstrates how the same discipline can be applied to water. As the president of his village’s water committee, he presides over a fragile equilibrium; weighing how much his community can draw now without depriving itself in the future. He measures fields not just in harvests, but in the worth of water that nurtures them.\nReimagining Water Usage in Agriculture\nFor generations, farmers had equated abundance of water with abundance of crops and, by extension, more income. Songira showed them that prosperity could be multiplied even with the same amount of water. Farmers who once inundated their crops with little regard, now practise frugal watering, convinced that restraint can coexist with prosperity. Their experience underscores a larger truth: the endurance of communities, and the livelihoods they sustain, will depend on how optimally water is used.\nIndia holds 18 per cent of the world’s population, yet has access to barely 4 per cent of global freshwater. Agriculture alone consumes more than four-fifths of the nation’s water, and is deeply intertwined with both water availability and economic well-being. Scarcity here is not an ecological concept but a tangible economic deficit.\nA Threat to Both Ecology and Economy\nIndia irrigates extensively but wastefully, using two-to-threefold more water per tonne of crop compared to its global counterparts. Productivity is still gauged by output per hectare rather than efficiency per unit of water. The result is deceptive abundance: farmers harvest more, but their incomes remain precarious as groundwater declines and energy costs of pumping rise. The question one should ask is not “How much can I grow per hectare?” but rather, “How much income can I derive per litre of water?” Reconceptualising efficiency can recast water as a generator of livelihoods rather than a constraint upon them. Taking a ‘One Water’ approach offers a structured pathway for this transition; recognising rainfall, rivers, and even reclaimed wastewater as components of a single interconnected cycle.\nClimate volatility – erratic monsoons, scorching temperatures, and intense, short-duration rainfall events – intensifies pressures on water resources and rural livelihoods. Farmers perceive this disruption viscerally: parched wells, heat-scorched crops, or sudden, unseasonal floods that strip fertile topsoil, yet fail to recognise one of the key underlying drivers – climate change. Farmers should be able to connect observable anomalies to the underlying root causes. It is our imperative to simplify technical concepts such as runoff and precipitation variability, enabling farmers to grasp the “why” behind their lived realities. Only then does informed action emerge, which can manifest in two forms: adaptation and mitigation.\nWater Management as Livelihood Security\nThe very water-budgeting that Songira applies was cultivated with support from industry experts. Through the ‘Water Security Programme’ implemented by the Centre for MicroFinance (CMF), an affiliate of Tata Trusts, his village water committee received structured guidance: crafting water security plans, technical and financial support, seeding water-augmentation and conservation systems, building capacity in panchayats and local institutions, leveraging government schemes, and ensuring quality drinking water. This illustrates a clear lesson: when empowered with knowledge, technical guidance, and institutional backing, people can learn to conserve resources, and more broadly, secure livelihoods, enhance resilience, and create a model for sustainable prosperity for others to emulate.\nIndividual and collective efforts need to address both supply augmentation and demand management. The supply-side measures, including watershed restoration and soil-moisture conservation, must converge with demand-side strategies like crop diversification and water use efficiency that prioritise thrift over excess.\nNo less a priority is cultivating an ethic of vigilance. Too often, water becomes a focus only when there’s news of cuts or shortages – suddenly everyone is alert, suddenly every drop counts. But why wait for a crisis? True sustainability comes with judicious use of water, whether scarcity looms or not. When communities internalise the value of water, every drop can be conserved and utilised with care. The ‘One Water, One Community’ model puts this into practice, organising villagers into committees like Nal Jal Samitis or Pani Samitis to plan, manage, and maintain local water systems. In Gharat, Rajasthan, women-led groups are mobilised to manage the local water scheme, collecting contributions from every household, maintaining accounts, making water security a shared responsibility. This collective action ensures the entire community is invested in long-term water security.\nThe implications extend well beyond agriculture. Water scarcity intersects with health, education, and gender equity. When women and adolescent girls traverse miles to fetch water, opportunities for income and schooling dwindle. When smallholders abandon their fields due to exhausted wells, urban migration intensifies, overburdening already stressed cities. Conversely, when water systems are secure, villages generate not only food but also stability, improving nutrition, reducing migration, and strengthening local economies. Water management, in essence, is livelihood management.\nCollective Responsibility in Sustainable Water Use\nIndia’s water discourse is steeped in apocalyptic narratives – wars over rivers, aquifers collapsing, rivers running dry. Scarcity, when recognized as a collective risk, can spark collective responsibility. Water is not a peripheral resource but the very bedrock of economic life. If the nation can adopt caution not merely in drought years but also in seasons of plenty, it can safeguard both ecology and economy. The choice is unambiguous: extract until exhaustion, or steward until sustainability. The former courts collapse, the latter promises continuity.\n(Divyang Waghela, Head of Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WaSH), Tata Trusts.)\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

Its asset-light model and EBITDA-positive performance since FY24 highlight its improving profitability trajectory,\" the analyst said.\nHe however cautioned that investors should be mindful of the risks and structural constraints. \"Margins remain thin, ROE and ROCE are modest, and revenue is concentrated with its top client contributing around 50%. At the upper price band, the IPO implies an EV/EBITDA of ~106x, which is rich compared with peers, suggesting that current valuations already reflect significant growth expectations,\" he said.\nOverall, Shadowfax offers long-term exposure to India’s logistics and hyperlocal delivery sector, but the IPO is better suited for investors with a long-term horizon, who are comfortable tracking execution, client diversification, and margin expansion over time, the analyst said. He added that for short-term listing gains, the risk-reward appears balanced but neutral.\nFollow all IPO news here.",

        "full_content": "As India’s digital commerce story widens beyond large online marketplaces to include hyperlocal retail and quick commerce, Shadowfax believes it is well placed to ride the next phase of growth in logistics.\nSpeaking exclusively to Moneycontrol, Vaibhav Khandelwal, Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Shadowfax, pointed to India’s still-low digital penetration as a key opportunity. Online commerce accounts for only about 7 percent of overall consumption, and the number of orders per person remains a fraction of what is seen in mature markets such as the US and China. “That gap itself creates a long runway,” he said, adding that growth is expected across express, hyperlocal and quick commerce deliveries.\nStrong revenue momentum, focus on diversification:\nShadowfax has posted a revenue CAGR of over 30 percent between FY23 and FY25, with growth accelerating to 68 percent in the first half of FY26. While management stopped short of offering guidance, it attributed the momentum to a conscious push towards more specialised, value-added services rather than just chasing volumes.\nThe company continues to draw a large share of its business from platforms such as Flipkart and Meesho, a factor investors are closely watching. Khandelwal acknowledged the concentration but said the dependence has been easing gradually. Large clients helped Shadowfax build scale and nationwide infrastructure, he said, after which the focus has shifted to expanding business with D2C brands and smaller enterprises across the country.\nWhat sets Shadowfax apart?\nA big part of Shadowfax’s pitch lies in its value-added offerings — including reverse logistics, doorstep quality checks, open-box deliveries, express services and hyperlocal fulfilment. These, management said, involve solving more complex operational problems and require deeper technology and execution capabilities.\nExpress deliveries, in particular, have seen sharp traction, with Shadowfax’s market share rising to 23 percent from 8 percent in FY22. Hyperlocal and quick commerce deliveries, meanwhile, have a steady base level of demand, helping cushion seasonality.\nProfitability, margins and the road ahead:\nOn profitability, Shadowfax said its improving margins are being supported by express deliveries, hyperlocal and quick commerce, and premium services. The company said it has been profitable for the past 10 quarters, with adjusted EBITDA margins improving from about 1 percent in FY24 to 2.8 percent in H1 FY26. Khandelwal said the journey has been steady, moving from operational profitability to EBITDA and then PAT — with a longer-term ambition to approach early to mid-teens margin levels seen in mature markets.\nThe company added that its crowdsourced delivery model allows it to handle demand spikes without carrying high fixed costs, while keeping cash flows and working capital in check.\nValuation and capital discipline:\nValuations have been a point of debate across several recent IPOs, and Shadowfax is no exception. Market participants have flagged the company’s pricing as steep, particularly when compared with peers such as Blue Dart Express and Delhivery. At the upper end of the price band, Shadowfax is valued at over Rs 7,000 crore. Responding to these concerns, Khandelwal pointed to strong anchor investor participation, improving profitability and a technology-led business model as key factors supporting the valuation. He added that the company remains focused on disciplined capital allocation, prudent working capital management and selective acquisitions in niche, value-added segments.\nFollow all IPO news here.",

Global retail giant Walmart-owned digital payments firm filed draft papers with market regulator SEBI for IPO via the confidential pre-filing route in late September.\nSecond-largest New Economy IPO\nThe public listing of the Bengaluru-based payments giant sets the stage for the second-largest new economy listing after rival Paytm’s IPO in late 2021. Noida-based Paytm’s IPO valuation was around $20 billion, with the IPO size of around Rs 18,000 crore.\nFood and grocery delivery platform Swiggy’s IPO size was around $1.35 billion, with the company raising Rs 11,300 crore in November 2024.\nDominant player in UPI\nPhonePe has around 45 percent market share in the mobile payments platform, UPI, with its nearest competitor, Google Pay, holding around 35 percent market share. More than 85 percent of the country’s digital payments are processed by the UPI platform.\nThe consistent dominance of the UPI space, even as the payment platform continues to see new entrants with deep pockets, is what makes PhonePe’s IPO bid strong.  The continued growth of the platform, along with newer use cases and strong innovation, makes UPI an unrivalled platform for digital payments in the country.\nPhonePe processes close to 10 billion transactions worth over Rs 12 lakh crore every month.\nThe company also has multiple other verticals, from a stock market trading app share.market, lending platform and sale of insurance policies, among others.\nDespite diversification, payments continue to anchor PhonePe’s growth, accounting for over 90 per cent of its total revenue.\nSellers in the IPO\nWalmart, Tiger Global and Microsoft are the three shareholders looking to participate in the offer for sale, which will involve a combined dilution of around 10 per cent stake.\nKotak Mahindra Capital, Citi, Morgan Stanley, and JP Morgan, as advisors for a big-bang IPO, were targeting a listing valuation of up to $15 billion.\nFintech IPOs\nWhile Paytm’s IPO was fully subscribed at $20-billion valuation and Rs 18,000-crore fundraising, its valuation plummeted soon after as multiple analysts downgraded the stock. Paytm’s current valuation is around $9.5 billion.\nWealth-tech platform Groww listed late last year at around $7.5-billion valuation and is now trading at a valuation of around $10.5 billion.\nInsurance marketplace PB Fintech IPO has been a big success, with the company’s current valuation at around $9 billion, compared with the $6 billion it listed at.\nThe initial public offering (IPO) of Pine Labs closed for public subscription on November 11 after being subscribed nearly 2.5 times its offer size on its third and final day of bidding.  The total issue size is estimated at Rs 3,900 crore. This includes a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 2,080 crore, and an offer-for-sale of 8.23 crore equity shares by key investors including Peak XV Partners, Macritchie Investments, Madison India, Mastercard, and PayPal.",

        "full_content": "The IPO of Shadowfax Technologies opened for public bidding on January 20. The maiden public issue of the company has been subscribed 47 percent on Day 1.\nThe initial public offering of the company received bids for 4.18 crore shares, as against an offer size of nearly 8.91 crore shares, according to data on NSE. Retail investors have shown the most interest in the IPO so far, fully-booking their reserved portion (111 percent).\nNon Institutional Investors (NII) have booked 22 percent of the portion kept for them, while Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB) have subscribed 38 percent of their reserved portion.\nShadowfax IPO GMP:\nAhead of listing, the unlisted shares of Shadowfax Tech were trading with 3.23 percent grey market premium (GMP) over the IPO price, according to data on Investorgain. This is lower than the 8.06 percent GMP quoted by the site a day before yesterday, and 4.84 percent quoted yesterday.\nAccording to IPO Watch, the unlisted shares of the company were trading with 4.84 percent GMP over the IPO price.\nAbout Shadowfax IPO:\nBengaluru-based technology-led logistics solutions provider Shadowfax Tech moved to the primary capital market to raise Rs 1,907.2 crore through its initial public offering (IPO), which comprises a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 1,000 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of shares worth Rs 907.2 crore by several investors including Flipkart, Eight Roads Investments, Qualcomm, and NewQuest Asia Fund.\nThe price band for the IPO has been set at Rs 118-124 per share. Investors can bid for a minimum of 120 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,160, and in multiples thereafter.\nThe IPO will remain open for public bidding between January 20 and January 22. The allotments are likely to be finalized by January 23, and the shares are scheduled to be listed on stock exchanges on January 28.\nHow will the IPO proceeds be used?\nThe company proposes to utilise proceeds from the fresh issue towards funding enhancing capacity in terms of network infrastructure, funding of lease payments for new first mile, last mile, and sort centres, as well as towards branding, marketing, and communication initiatives, unidentified inorganic acquisitions, and general corporate purposes.\nShadowfax IPO anchor book:\nA day before the IPO opened for public bidding, Shadowfax announced that it has raised Rs 856.02 crore from 39 anchor investors on January 19.\n\"Out of the total allocation, 3.67 crore equity shares worth Rs 455.73 crore were allocated to nine domestic mutual funds including ICICI Prudential AMC, Nippon Life India, Motilal Oswal AMC, Bandhan Mutual Fund, HSBC MF, Helios MF, JM Financial MF, and Trust Mutual Fund,\" Shadowfax Technologies in its filing to exchanges said.\nICICI Prudential AMC was the largest investor in the anchor book, acquiring 1.53 crore equity shares for Rs 190 crore through its four schemes - ICICI Prudential Flexicap Fund, ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage Fund, ICICI Prudential Transportation and Logistics Fund, and ICICI Prudential Exports and Services Fund.\nShould you apply for Shadowfax IPO?\nThe Indian logistics industry is entering a strong growth phase, driven by the rapid expansion of online retail and quick commerce, said Master Capital Services. It added that the industry is valued at Rs 21-23 trillion in FY2025, reflecting its scale and importance in supporting trade and consumption.\nOnline retail is the fastest growing channel in organized retail and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 20-25% from FY25 to FY30, the brokerage said, adding that within this, quick commerce is the fastest growing segment, expected to expand at an exceptional CAGR of 50-62% till FY30, highlighting rising consumer demand for faster and on-demand deliveries.\nE-commerce (excluding quick commerce) accounted for around 6% of the total Indian retail market in FY2025 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 15–20%, reaching a 9–10% market share by FY30, Master Capital Services said, adding that the number of online shoppers in India is also expected to grow at an 8–10% CAGR by FY30, providing a strong volume base for logistics services.\n“In this evolving landscape, Shadowfax Technologies Ltd is strategically positioned as a technology-led 3PL platform, enabling scalable, reliable, and time-sensitive logistics solutions across e-commerce, quick commerce, and hyperlocal delivery. With strong exposure to high-growth segments and a digital-first operating model, the company stands to benefit significantly from the structural growth of India’s logistics ecosystem. Investors may consider the IPO as a potential long-term investment opportunity,” the brokerage said.\nGaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk, noted that Shadowfax offers a compelling play on India’s rapidly growing e-commerce and quick-commerce ecosystem. \"With pan-India reach across over 14,700 pincodes and a client roster that includes Flipkart, Meesho, Swiggy, Zomato, and Blinkit, the company has demonstrated strong revenue growth (~32% CAGR FY23–25) and operational scalability through its large gig-based delivery network. Its asset-light model and EBITDA-positive performance since FY24 highlight its improving profitability trajectory,\" the analyst said.\nHe however cautioned that investors should be mindful of the risks and structural constraints. \"Margins remain thin, ROE and ROCE are modest, and revenue is concentrated with its top client contributing around 50%. At the upper price band, the IPO implies an EV/EBITDA of ~106x, which is rich compared with peers, suggesting that current valuations already reflect significant growth expectations,\" he said.\nOverall, Shadowfax offers long-term exposure to India’s logistics and hyperlocal delivery sector, but the IPO is better suited for investors with a long-term horizon, who are comfortable tracking execution, client diversification, and margin expansion over time, the analyst said. He added that for short-term listing gains, the risk-reward appears balanced but neutral.\nFollow all IPO news here.",

        "full_content": "The shares of UltraTech Cement jumped nearly 4 percent on January 27 after the company released better than expected results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. Brokerages have issued bullish calls for the stock.\nThe shares of the cement-maker jumped to Rs 12,825.00 apiece in the morning trading hours of Tuesday. This is the highest level seen by the stock since early September last year.\nUltraTech Cement Q3 Results:\nUltraTech Cement on January 24 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,725.40 crore attributable to the firm’s owners for the third quarter of the ongoing financial year 2025. This marks a 27 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from the Rs 1,359.43 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25.\nNotably, the net profit reported during the quarter included an exceptional item of Rs 88.48 crore due to the one-time impact of the New Labour Codes which took effect from November 21.\nThe firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile grew around 23 percent YoY to Rs 21,829.68 crore in Q3 FY26, from Rs 17,778.83 crore in Q3 FY25. Its consolidated sales volumes grew 15 percent to 38.87 mtpa during the quarter under review.\nJM Financial on UltraTech Cement:\nJM Financial said that UltraTech Cement reported a strong Q3 FY26 earnings performance with consolidated EBITDA rising 35 percent YoY to Rs 3,920 crore, beating its estimates primarily due to lower-than-estimated cost/tn.\n“Management highlighted robust demand momentum is likely to sustain supported by infra projects. The industry has taken price hikes in Jan’26 and anticipates further price hike likely supported by improving demand. We argue UltraTech is poised for structural improvement in return ratios over the next three–four years owing to: i) rising asset turnover; ii) low cost of expansion; and iii) improving profitability. Factoring in the 3Q performance and improving demand/pricing, we are increasing EBITDA by 6% for FY26E and 1–3% for FY27E–28E,” the brokerage said.\nIt maintained its ‘Buy’ rating on the stock, while raising its target price to Rs 14,500 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 17 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.\nChoice Broking on UltraTech Cement:\nChoice Institutional Equities said that it continues to remain positive on UltraTech Cement due to ambitious and continuous capacity expansion plan to add 8 mnt of capacity in Q4 FY26, and 12 mnt in FY27, funding expansion outlay largely via internal accruals, proactive cost-optimisation strategy, favourable sectoral pricing environment and significant demand growth in expected from the southern market.\nThe domestic brokerage maintained its ‘Buy’ rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 15,210 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 23 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.\nMotilal Oswal on UltraTech Cement:\nMotilal Oswal said that UltraTech Cement’s Q3 FY26 EBITDA was above its estimate, led by higher-than-estimated volume growth and lower-than-estimated opex/t. “Management indicated a positive demand outlook, highlighting a multi-year infrastructure pipeline across all regions, led by roads, metros, railways, ports, airports and housing segments,” the brokerage noted.\n“We largely maintain our FY26 EBITDA estimate and raise FY27/28 EBITDA estimates by 4% each, considering high volume growth vs. previous estimates. We increase our FY27/28 EPS estimates by ~5% each. We value UTCEM at 18x FY28E EV/EBITDA to arrive at a TP of INR14,200. Reiterate BUY,” it added.\nUltraTech Cement share price:\nUltraTech Cement shares have gained more than 7 percent in the past one month, and over 6 percent in 2026 so far.\nFollow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "The shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank tumbled more than 5 percent on January 27 after the company released its results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. Brokerages have mixed views for the stock, with some cutting forecasts after the lender’s earnings missed estimates.\nThe shares of the heavyweight lender dropped to Rs 400.5 apiece, recording the sharpest single-day fall since July 2025.\nKotak Mahindra Q3 Results:\nKotak Mahindra Bank on January 24 reported a standalone net profit of Rs 3,446.14 crore for Q3 FY26. This marks a 4 percent year-on-year increase from the Rs 3,305 crore net profit reported in the same quarter of the previous financial year.\nThe bank's results missed estimates, as analysts had expected a profit of Rs 3,572 crore, according to data compiled by LSEG.\nNet Interest Income (NII) increased more than 5 percent YoY to Rs 7,565 crore during the quarter under review, from Rs 7,196 crore a year ago. However, net interest margin (NIM) declined to 4.54 percent from 4.93 percent in the third quarter of the previous financial year.\nAsset quality slightly improved sequentially, with gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio moderating to 1.30 percent as on December 31, 2025, from 1.50 percent a year ago. Net NPA also eased to 0.31 per cent from 0.41 per cent at the end of December 2024.\nHDFC Securities on Kotak Mahindra Bank:\nHDFC Securities noted that Kotak Mahindra Bank’s Q3 earnings were below estimates, as flattish margins, soft traction in fee income, and relatively high opex intensity was partly offset by higher growth on both sides of the balance sheet.\n“Healthy loan growth (16% YoY) was driven by mortgages, business banking, SME segments. Deposit growth (~14% YoY) was strong with CASA ratio at 41.3% (-101bps QoQ) and softer than usual traction in CA balances. While the stress in unsecured segments has largely abated, stress in retail CV segment remains elevated. We are constructive on KMB, expecting growth momentum to sustain in RoA-accretive segments such as LAP, CV/CE, tractors, business banking, and SME, concomitantly reshaping its unsecured segment strategy,” the domestic brokerage said.\nIt cut the lender’s FY26E/FY27E earnings forecasts by 5/2 percent, factoring in softer margins and fee income. It maintained its ‘Buy’ rating for the stock, with a target price of Rs 495 apiece, implying an upside potential of more than 17 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.\nWhile growth is picking up, higher opex was seen after four quarters of managing it well, noted CLSA. Emkay meanwhile expects Kotak Mahindra Bank to report a relatively moderate RoA of 1.9 percent in FY26E, albeit with an improvement to 2 percent in FY27/FY28E as margins and loss -loss provisions normalize\nMotilal Oswal on Kotak Mahindra Bank:\nMotilal Oswal said the lender’s NII and other income stood largely in line with its estimates. Operating expenses came in higher than anticipated, while provisions were lower than estimates.\n“The decline in the unsecured portfolio has now been arrested, and the bank has reiterated its guidance for stronger growth in the coming quarters, which should also support margins. Overall loan growth is guided at 1.5-2.0x nominal GDP, driven by stable momentum in retail and unsecured segments. Given the continued growth traction, we believe the bank is well positioned to deliver a healthy ~16% loan CAGR over FY26-28E,” the domestic brokerage said.\nMotilal maintained its earnings estimate, along with a ‘Buy’ call on the stock with a target price of Rs 500 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 18 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.\nKotak Mahindra Bank share price:\nKotak Mahindra Bank shares have fallen more than 5 percent in the past one month, but gained around 4 percent in the past six months.\nThe stock which currently has a P/E ratio of 22.50, is currently the top loser on benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty, as well as the Nifty Bank index.\nFollow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "Shares of Adani Group companies rebounded sharply by up to 5 percent in early trade on Tuesday, January 27, with Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone emerging among the top gainers on the Nifty. The recovery in Adani group stocks today follows a steep selloff in the previous session triggered by US regulatory developments.\nAdani Enterprises shares rose nearly 5 percent to around Rs 1,955, while Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone gained over 4 percent to Rs 1,363, placing both stocks among the top of the Nifty gainers’ list in morning trade. The rebound follows a sharp decline on Friday, January 23, when Adani group stocks fell as much as 14 percent amid reports that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had sought court permission to serve legal summons on billionaire Gautam Adani and group executive Sagar Adani.\nOther Adani group stocks also traded higher on Tuesday. Adani Green Energy advanced nearly 4 percent to about Rs 802, Adani Energy Solutions rose close to 4 percent to around Rs 844, and Adani Power was up over 2 percent at roughly Rs 136.\nEarlier, on January 23, Adani Enterprises had closed nearly 11 percent lower, its lowest level since May 19, 2023. Adani Green Energy stock had slumped more than 14 percent, while Adani Ports had ended the session down about 7 percent. Adani Energy Solutions had fallen 10 percent, marking its biggest single-day percentage drop since November 21, 2024.\nThe selloff was sparked by reports that the SEC had asked a US court for permission to directly email summons to Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani in connection with an alleged fraud and a USD 265 million bribery scheme. According to Reuters, the SEC told the court that it did not expect service to be completed through existing channels after India declined two earlier requests to serve the summons.\nAdani Group has rejected the allegations, calling them “baseless”, and has said it would pursue “all possible legal recourse”. In June, Gautam Adani had stated that “despite all the noise”, no one from the Adani Group had been charged with violating the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or conspiring to obstruct justice.\nSeparately, Adani Enterprises informed stock exchanges that it is not a party to the legal proceedings referenced in recent media reports and that the matter does not trigger any disclosure requirements under India’s listing regulations. Responding to queries from BSE and NSE following a media report, the company said there are “no allegations made against the Company” and that it is not involved in the proceedings cited. It added that the reported developments do not have any bearing on its disclosure or compliance obligations under SEBI regulations.\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "Shares of Axis Bank Ltd jumped nearly 4 percent in early trade on Tuesday, January 27, after the private sector lender reported a better-than-expected results for Q3 FY26. The strong financial performance drew a string of bullish brokerage responses on earnings visibility, asset quality and valuations.\nAxis Bank stock was trading at Rs 1,306.6, up 3.86 percent, extending its strong run over the past year. The stock has gained 37.3 percent over the last 12 months, sharply outperforming the Nifty 50, which is up about 9.7 percent over the same period.\nAxis Bank Q3 results beat estimates\nAxis Bank reported a 3 percent year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 6,489.6 crore for Q3 FY26, beating the CNBC-TV18 poll estimate of Rs 6,046 crore. Net interest income grew 5 percent on-year to Rs 14,286.4 crore, also ahead of Street expectations, reflecting steady core lending performance.\nAsset quality improved sequentially, with gross NPAs easing to 1.40 percent from 1.46 percent in the September quarter and net NPAs declining to 0.42 percent from 0.44 percent. In absolute terms, gross NPAs fell quarter-on-quarter, while net NPAs edged up marginally.\nAxis Bank stock call: Brokerages turn more bullish\nBrokerages were largely positive on the stock outlook, citing improving credit cost visibility, resilient profitability metrics and attractive valuations.\nCiti upgraded Axis Bank to a ‘Buy’ and raised its target price to Rs 1,436, implying an upside of over 14 percent. Citi highlighted another core earnings beat and return on assets of around 1.5 percent. The brokerage flagged stable slippages despite agricultural seasonality, lower-than-expected credit costs and improved cost efficiency, even as treasury gains and fee income remained muted.\nCLSA maintained its ‘Outperform’ rating with a target price of Rs 1,500, calling asset quality the key highlight of the quarter. It noted that excluding technical slippages, gross slippages declined sharply on-year, driven by unsecured retail credit, while credit costs came in below estimates.\nBernstein, which has an ‘Outperform’ rating and a target of Rs 1,480, described the quarter as mixed, with healthy loan and deposit growth offset by margin pressure and elevated credit costs. Still, it said return on assets was sustained at around 1.5 percent.\nNomura reiterated its ‘Buy’ call with a target price of Rs 1,540, pointing to improving credit cost visibility and strengthening growth trends. The brokerage expects return on assets of 1.7-1.8 percent and return on equity of around 15 percent over FY27-28, with earnings CAGR estimated at 26 percent.\nHSBC also maintained a ‘Buy’ rating, setting a target price of Rs 1,580, and said the upgrade thesis was playing out as expected, supported by sharp improvement in credit costs and strong growth and margin performance. Jefferies retained its ‘Buy’ call with a target of Rs 1,550, citing a profit beat driven by stronger topline, lower credit costs and controlled operating expenses.\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "Asian equities edged lower as tariff concerns resurfaced after President Donald Trump threatened to raise levies on South Korean goods. The yen held its gains.\nThe Kospi Index, one of the world’s best-performing benchmarks this year, fell 0.9%, while the South Korean won weakened after four days of gains. Japanese shares fell for a second day, weighed down by a stronger yen.\nThe yen traded near around 154 per dollar after gaining on the greenback over the past two sessions amid speculation the US may coordinate intervention with Japan. A gauge of the dollar was steady Tuesday, hovering around levels last seen in 2022. Gold and silver also traded near their record highs on Tuesday.\nWhile much of the market’s focus has been on currencies and the risk of yen intervention, tariff concerns have also resurfaced after Trump warned of 100% levies on Canada. The added uncertainty comes in a pivotal week for investors, with megacap technology earnings set to test whether the artificial-intelligence driven rally can be sustained.\n“Tech has become more of a show-me story,” said Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer for wealth and investment management at Wells Fargo, which manages $2.3 trillion. “If Big Tech can continue to deliver, I think capital will start flowing in tech’s direction again.”\nIn the US, companies accounting for roughly a third of the S&P 500’s market capitalization report this week.\nThe US president has ratcheted up trade tensions with several allies in recent weeks, threatening to raise duties on Canadian products to 100% if Ottawa signed a trade deal with China. Trump attributed a 25% tariff hike on South Korean goods to the country’s legislature failing to codify a trade agreement reached with the US last year.\nTrump had earlier threatened to slap new charges on European countries’ goods over his quest to seize control of Greenland. He then backed off.\nMeanwhile, the yen’s gains remained in focus after comments from Japanese officials fueled speculation that the government may intervene in the market to prevent the currency from resuming its slide. To some, however, the recent rally has partly neutralized the likelihood of intervention.\n“The dramatic recovery in the yen suggests that actual intervention is not needed,” said Marc Chandler at Bannockburn Capital Markets.\nElsewhere, US power grids are under mounting pressure following a winter storm that unleashed deep cold and heavy snow and ice from Texas to Maine. That’s knocked an estimated 12% of US natural gas production off-line and forecasts for frigid weather caused prices to soar.\nUS natural gas prices jumped around 30%.\nTreasuries remained in a narrow range on Monday with the Federal Reserve expected to pause its rate cuts when it announces its policy on Wednesday.\nFed officials are expected to hold rates steady following three straight cuts at the end of 2025, as a steadier jobs market restores a degree of consensus at the central bank after months of growing division. Chair Jerome Powell is likely to telegraph his view that policy is well-positioned for now, but refrain from signaling much about where rates are headed.\nExpectations about Fed policy have been shifting in response to changes in the consensus view on whom Trump will nominate to succeed Powell, whose term expires in May.\n“Even though the Fed isn’t expected to cut interest rates, Powell’s press conference may be as much about Fed independence as it is policy,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.",

The daily, weekly and monthly strength RSI is in positive territory, signalling rising strength. The daily and weekly Bollinger Band signals indicate increased price movement.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 1,800, Rs 1,850\nStop-Loss: Rs 1,640\nBank of India | CMP: 159.65\nOn the weekly chart, Bank of India has confirmed a “multiple resistance” breakout at the Rs 154 level on a closing basis, along with huge volumes, which signifies bullish sentiment. The stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100- and 200-day SMA, and these averages are also inching up along with rising prices, which reconfirms a bullish trend. The weekly and monthly strength RSI is in positive territory, signalling rising strength.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 180, Rs 185\nStop-Loss: Rs 154\nPG Electroplast | CMP: Rs 510.35\nOn the daily and weekly charts, PG Electroplast is in a downtrend, forming a series of lower tops and bottom formations. It has also decisively broken a 5–6 month up-sloping trendline on a closing basis, along with huge volumes, indicating selling pressure. The stock is sustaining below its 50-, 100- and 200-day SMAs, which reconfirms a short-term downtrend.\nThe daily, weekly and monthly strength indicator RSI remains weak, indicating continued weakness in the recent downturn. Investors should consider exiting long positions as well as initiating fresh shorts in this stock.\nStrategy: Sell\nTarget: Rs 470, Rs 450\nStop-Loss: Rs 550\nRajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One\nHindustan Unilever | CMP: Rs 2,409.50\nWhile the benchmark index Nifty ended the week with a decline of around 2.5 percent, Hindustan Unilever acted as a defensive outperformer, gaining nearly 2 percent during the week and exhibiting strong relative strength.\nOn the daily chart, prices are forming a bullish Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern and are placed above all major moving averages, which supports the buy view. Additionally, the smoothened RSI has generated a fresh buy signal, with a bullish crossover above its signal line on both the daily and weekly charts. Hence, we recommend buying Hindustan Unilever in the range of Rs 2,410–2,400.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 2,550\nStop-Loss: Rs 2,330\nMax Financial Services | CMP: Rs 1,599\nMax Financial Services has been trading in a range over the past three months and, after failing to cross the Rs 1,750 mark on two occasions, has now breached key support levels, confirming a topping-out formation in the form of a Double Top.\nPrices have also slipped below the crucial 89 DEMA, which earlier acted as support and now signals a change in polarity. On the indicator front, the RSI remains in the negative zone, further reinforcing the sell view. Hence, we recommend selling Max Financial Services around Rs 1,595.\nStrategy: Sell\nTarget: Rs 1,500\nStop-Loss: Rs 1,640\nAnshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments\nShriram Finance | CMP: Rs 1,003.55\nShriram Finance is forming a classic pole-and-flag structure on the daily chart, with the flag marked by low-volume sideways consolidation between Rs 961 and Rs 1,025.6. The contraction reflects healthy digestion after a strong impulsive pole, not distribution. Institutional volumes during the pole were clearly accumulative, lending credibility to the continuation setup.\nA pre-emptive long around Rs 1,003 offers a front-running opportunity with a favourable risk–reward ratio ahead of confirmation. However, real momentum acceleration will only emerge on a decisive breakout above Rs 1,025. A sustained breach of this ceiling is likely to unleash sharp follow-through buying, projecting an initial upside toward the Rs 1,100 zone. Until then, the flag structure remains constructive, with dips likely to be absorbed rather than sold.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 1,100\nStop-Loss: Rs 960\nBank of Maharashtra | CMP: Rs 65.63\nBank of Maharashtra is on the verge of resolving a powerful 371-day rounding base, with a very shallow handle making it a textbook cup-and-handle structure. The base has seen clear institutional accumulation, while the right-side development shows tight price action with sharply dried-up volumes, signalling calm before expansion. This contraction reflects absorption, not supply.\nThe breakout pivot is precisely placed at Rs 67.63, and a decisive breach with follow-through would confirm momentum ignition. Given the strength of the base, the move is likely to be fast and directional. On confirmation, the stock can propel toward the Rs 78–79 zone initially. With a pre-budget tailwind building across PSU banking names, the risk–reward favours an upside resolution, while failure to clear the pivot would only delay, not negate, the broader bullish structure.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget: Rs 79\nStop-Loss: Rs 62\nUnion Bank of India | CMP: Rs 172.77\nUnion Bank of India has delivered a decisive breakout from a massive 2,002-day VCP (Volume Contraction Pattern) structure, marking a major long-term trend shift. Post breakout, the stock has paused into an eight-day tight flag, acting as a pit stop rather than exhaustion. This brief consolidation has allowed short-term indicators and momentum to cool off without damaging the structure.\nMoving averages across daily and weekly charts remain bullishly aligned and continue to act as a launchpad. The setup signals stored energy ahead of expansion. A clean breakout and sustain above Rs 176 would trigger the next momentum leg, opening an initial move toward Rs 189. Beyond that, the multi-year high near Rs 220 becomes the next logical zone where profit booking may emerge. Until then, the structure favours continuation over consolidation.\nStrategy: Buy\nTarget; Rs 189, Rs 220\nStop-Loss: Rs 164",

Reasons include a diversification away from US assets and rising defense spending boosting demand for base metals as well as AI-related demand.",

A gauge of the dollar fell to the lowest in nearly four years during the previous session, making gold more affordable for most buyers, while US President Donald Trump threatened to hike tariffs on South Korean goods to 25%.\nGold’s dramatic rally – the metal has more than doubled over the last two years – drives home bullion’s historic role as a gauge of fear in markets. Fresh from its best annual performance since 1979, it’s gained a further 17% so far this year due largely to the so-called debasement trade, whereby investors retreat from currencies and Treasuries. A massive selloff in the Japanese bond market is the latest example of investors rejecting heavy fiscal spending.\nIn recent weeks, the Trump administration’s actions — attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve, threats to annex Greenland, military intervention in Venezuela — have also shaken markets. The US leader’s warning to South Korea follows a threat to Canada over the weekend to impose 100% tariffs if Ottawa makes a trade deal with China.\nOptions traders are betting gold will rally further as investors diversify from American assets. Implied volatility of Comex gold futures climbed to the highest since the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, while volatility on State Street’s SPDR Gold Shares — the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund — has also broken out higher.\nLooking ahead, investors will also be keeping a close tab on the Federal Reserve’s actions on Wednesday, with the US central bank widely expected to halt its rate-cutting cycle as a steadier jobs market restores a degree of consensus after months of growing division.\nGold rose 0.9% to $5,051.50 an ounce as of 8:15 a.m. in Singapore. Silver advanced 3.6% to $107.49 an ounce, having hit an all-time high above $117.71 in the previous session before retreating.

The safe-haven metal is up more than 17% this year, after soaring 64% in 2025.\nThe London Bullion Market Association's annual precious metals forecast survey shows analysts projecting gold rising as high as $7,150 and averaging $4,742 in 2026.\nGoldman Sachs has raised its December 2026 gold price forecast to $5,400 from $4,900.\nIndependent analyst Ross Norman expects a high of $6,400 this year, with an average of $5,375.\n\"The only certainty at the moment seems to be uncertainty, and that's playing very much into gold's hands,\" Norman said.\nGEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS\nGold's recent rally has been fuelled by geopolitical tensions, from the U.S.–NATO friction over Greenland and tariff uncertainty to rising doubts over the independence of the U.S. Federal Reserve, among others.\n\"With the upcoming U.S. mid-term elections, political uncertainty may increase further. At the same time, persistent concerns about over-valued equity markets are likely to reinforce portfolio diversification flows into gold,\" said Philip Newman, a director at Metals Focus. [MKTS/GLOB]\n\"After crossing the $5,000/ounce milestone, we expect further upside,\" he added.\nROBUST CENTRAL BANK PURCHASES\nCentral-bank gold buying, a key driver of prices in 2025, is expected to stay strong this year.\nGoldman Sachs forecasts purchases to average 60 metric tons a month as emerging-market central banks continue diversifying reserves into gold.\nPoland's central bank, which held 550 tons of gold at end-2025, aims to lift reserves to 700 tons, Governor Adam Glapinski said this month.\nThese plans reaffirm the view that the key driver behind the spike in gold is central banks \"looking to de-dollarise ... and where else could you go except into gold?\" Norman said.\nChina's central bank extended its gold-buying spree for a 14th month in December.\nETF INFLOWS, RETAIL DEMAND\nInflows into gold-backed ETFs, which store bullion for investors and account for a significant amount of investment demand for the metal, are also underpinning prices as markets expect further U.S. rate cuts this year.\n\"There's an opportunity cost to holding gold which has no yield. As interest rates decline, so does this opportunity cost. If the Fed continues to lower rates in 2026, demand for gold should rise,\" said Chris Mancini, co-portfolio manager of the Gabelli Gold Fund.\nGold ETFs saw record inflows in 2025, led by North American funds, according to World Gold Council data, with annual inflows surging to $89 billion. In tonnage terms, inflows totalled 801 metric tons, the highest since their record in 2020.\nGold demand for jewellery has weakened amid high prices, partly offset by a strong appetite for small bars and coins in key markets such as India.\nBar-and-coin buying is also evident in Europe, though some investors are taking profit, analysts said.\nFor many retail investors, gold's appeal lies in its simplicity, said Frederic Panizzutti, global head of sales at Numismatica Genevensis, which trades precious metals coins.\n\"You don't need to analyse a balance sheet, assess credit risk or worry about a country or sovereign risk,\" he said. \"Your only risk with physical gold is the price direction. And as geopolitics and geoeconomics have become more complicated ... that simplicity has become more attractive.\"\nWHAT'S NEXT FOR GOLD?\nAnalysts say several factors could trigger a correction, including a pullback in U.S. rate-cut expectations, margin calls in equities, and easing concerns about Fed independence.\nHowever, most expect any pullback to be short-lived and treated as a buying opportunity.\n\"A meaningful and sustained decline in gold would require a return to a more stable economic and geopolitical backdrop, which currently appears unlikely,\" Newman added.",

The ongoing crisis in Ukraine and Gaza, and the US capture of the Venezuelan President, have also kept the price of gold high. On Saturday, the US President threatened a 100 percent tariff on Canada if it strikes a trade deal with China.\nMarket sentiment also improved with heightened expectations of monetary easing as Trump is expected to appoint the next Fed Chair, with markets pricing in a more dovish candidate.\nGold price outlook\nCommodity analysts now predict the price of yellow metal to hit $5,550 and up to $7,000 per ounce in the long term.\n\"Gold prices are trading at multi‑year highs, reflecting robust investor demand amid geopolitical and macro risks. In the short to mid term, gold is expected to climb another 10–20 percent, supported by persistent safe‑haven flows, continued central bank accumulation, and broad ETF inflows,” said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market, an online trading platform.\nRenisha Chainani, Head of Research at Augmont, also agrees that the price of gold in the short-to mid-term will likely remain firm with an upside bias. “Prices could move toward $5,500, with interim consolidation along the way.”\nCiting Fibonacci extension analysis, Apurva Sheth, Head of Market Research at Samco Securities, said that the next major target zone near $7,040 indicates further upside potential as the cycle progresses.\n“Looking ahead, while interim consolidations are natural after a strong run-up, the broader setup suggests gold remains well-positioned over the coming years. Overall, gold continues to behave as a reliable long-term portfolio anchor, rather than a short-term trade,” Sheth said.\nIndeed, with real yields still muted amid geopolitical uncertainties, gold is likely to stay on an upward path. A softer dollar, rising global debt, and continued central-bank buying should also keep the yellow metal well supported.",

        "full_content": "Gold rose beyond $5,000 an ounce for the first time, extending a breakneck rally fueled by US President Donald Trump’s reshaping of international relations and investor flight from sovereign bonds and currencies.\nBullion climbed to around $5,040, having gained more than 8% last week as geopolitical risks and dollar weakness reinforced demand. A key gauge of the US currency posted its biggest weekly decline since May, making precious metals cheaper for most buyers. Silver also advanced to a record, having crossed $100 an ounce in the previous session.\nGold’s dramatic rally – the metal has more than doubled over the last two years – drives home bullion’s historic role as a gauge of fear in markets. Fresh from its best annual performance since 1979, it’s gained more than 15% so far this year due largely to the so-called debasement trade, whereby investors retreat from currencies and Treasuries. A massive selloff in the Japanese bond market last week is the latest example of investors rejecting heavy fiscal spending.\nIn recent weeks, the Trump administration’s actions — attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve, threats to annex Greenland, military intervention in Venezuela — have also spooked markets. For investors looking to navigate this uncertainty, the haven appeal of gold has rarely been more attractive.\n“Gold is the inverse of confidence,” said Max Belmont, a portfolio manager at First Eagle Investment Management. “It’s a hedge against unexpected bouts of inflation, unanticipated drawdowns in the market, flare-ups in geopolitical risk.”\nBeyond geopolitics, swelling public debt in advanced economies has become another key pillar of gold’s rally. Some long-term investors, convinced that inflation will become the only path to state solvency, have piled into gold as a way to preserve purchasing power.\n“People have become a lot more worried about the long-term debt trajectory over the past three years,” said John Reade, chief strategist at the World Gold Council. “The place that I have found the debasement and debt arguments come through the most has been with family offices. They’re thinking about generational wealth protection, rather than the short term.”\nThis debasement trade reached its zenith in late 2025, when prominent investors like Citadel Securities Chief Executive Officer Ken Griffin and Bridgewater Associates Founder Ray Dalio pointed to gold’s rise as a warning signal.\nInvestors are now waiting for Trump’s pick for the next Fed chair after the US president said he has finished interviewing candidates, reiterating that he has someone in mind for the job. A more dovish chair would increase bets on further interest-rate cuts this year — a positive for non-yielding bullion — after three successive reductions.\nGold rose 1% to $5,035.25 an ounce as of 8:12 a.m. in Singapore. Silver advanced 2.2% to $105.50. Platinum edged lower, having earlier hit a record high, while palladium climbed. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was down 0.2% after losing 1.6% last week.",

        "full_content": "Silver delivered a strong performance between January 19 and January 22, posting double-digit gains and reaffirming its status as one of the better-performing commodities this cycle. Supported by firm industrial demand, persistent supply constraints, and its dual role as an industrial metal and monetary hedge, the move was fundamentally healthy rather than speculative. While short-term pauses are normal within an ongoing bull phase.\nA large section of investors who chose to participate through silver ETFs ended the period with returns that were materially lower than the performance of silver itself. Some even saw sharp drawdowns toward the end of the week, despite no comparable weakness in the commodity.\nThe First Signal: Price Moves That Didn’t Match the Asset\nThe above table compares daily price changes in MCX Silver with those of five major silver ETFs. The contrast is immediately visible. While MCX Silver posted strong cumulative gains over the period, ETF returns were uneven and, in aggregate, remained in single-digit.\nMore importantly, on the final day of the period (i.e., January 22), silver prices held firm while several ETFs corrected sharply. This is not a comment on volatility alone. It is a reflection of a deeper issue: the gap between asset performance and investor outcome.\nWhere the Gap Emerged: Trading Price vs True Value\nThe second table shows the premium or discount at which silver ETFs traded relative to their Net Asset Value.\nDuring the rally, several ETFs traded consistently at elevated premiums. In simple terms, investors were paying more than the value of the silver held by the fund. This excess did not represent higher silver prices. It represented pressure created by rapid buying and limited liquidity.\nAs buying intensity eased, prices gravitated back toward NAV. That adjustment reduced ETF prices even though silver prices remained resilient. The outcome felt like a loss, but it was not caused by silver. It was caused by how the entry was executed.\nHow Mispricing Turns Into Volatility\nThe third table captures intraday volatility, measured as the high-low range relative to the closing price. Here, the pattern becomes even clearer. Silver ETFs showed significantly wider intraday ranges compared with MCX Silver, particularly on the day premiums reversed. This isn’t accidental. Volatility rises when prices drift from value, even though the underlying asset remains stable.\nWhat This Means for Investors\nFor investors, the lesson is practical rather than theoretical.\n** Always compare the ETF market price with the indicative Net Asset Value (i-NAV) before buying.\n** Avoid entries when premiums stretch meaningfully above fair value.\n** Prefer staggered participation over urgency-driven buying.\nExpense ratios are predictable and gradual. Premiums are immediate and reversible. The difference between the two can decide whether a rally translates into wealth or frustration.\nETFs remain effective instruments when price discovery is orderly. When it is not, outcomes become uneven — even in rising markets. So, participating in a bull market is not only about choosing the right asset. It is also about ensuring that the chosen instrument allows the investor to actually receive the return the asset delivers.\nA Larger Market Consideration\nEpisodes like this highlight a structural gap in market design. When traded prices drift too far from the underlying value, volatility spikes, and outcomes increasingly disadvantage less-informed investors. Markets work best when price and NAV stay closely aligned, keeping volatility contained while allowing rallies to play out smoothly.\nFrom a regulatory standpoint, a few market-friendly measures could meaningfully improve outcomes:\n** Encourage tighter alignment between ETF market prices and i-NAV through clearer premium–discount tolerance bands. A clear realignment of circuit filters of ETFs and its underlying commodity (silver in this case) market should be looked into.\n** Introduce calibrated daily price range limits to prevent sharp, value-detached moves during periods of heavy flows.\n** Strengthen real-time i-NAV visibility to aid better price discovery for retail participants.\nSuch measures would be in line with the motto of the regulator: enhance stability, protect investors' interests, participation, and reinforce confidence without restricting access or innovation.\nClosing Thought\nSilver moved in the right direction this week. The difference lay in how efficiently that reward reached investors. Understanding the difference between market direction and market structure is no longer optional. It is essential. Because in modern markets, returns are earned not only by being right on the asset, but by choosing the right way to own it.\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "Markets were turbulent this week ended January 23, driven by Trump’s Greenland shifts, fears of a transatlantic trade war and renewed US–Iran tensions.\nThe Dollar Index slipped to 97.42, its lowest level since September 2025, amid heightened volatility and shifting geopolitical dynamics. President Trump’s tariff threats against Europe and renewed push to acquire Greenland unsettled investors. Trump warned of “big retaliation” if European countries were to sell US Treasury holdings in response to proposed tariffs targeting NATO partners, amid speculation that Europe could use US assets as leverage.\nMeanwhile, strong US economic data, including an upward revision to Q3 GDP to 4.4%, lower jobless claims, and steady PCE inflation, point to a reduced need for immediate policy easing. Still, US equities closed the choppy week with a second consecutive, albeit modest, weekly loss, as US–EU relations remained strained despite Trump stepping back from immediate tariff action and easing concerns of a US-EU trade war.\nBullion delivered a powerful breakout, with gold and silver posting fresh all-time highs amid surging safe-haven demand. Comex gold jumped over 8% on the week, extending gains for a third straight week to settle near $4,990 per troy ounce, marking its strongest weekly percentage advance since mid-2020, while Silver surged more than 14%, breaking the $100 per ounce level for the first time and settling above $103.\nThe rally was fueled by waning confidence in US assets, renewed trade frictions, a weaker dollar, ongoing geopolitical risks, and sustained central-bank buying. Concerns around US fiscal discipline, Federal Reserve independence, and stress in Japanese government bonds further amplified demand. MCX prices showed even higher volatility ahead of India's February 1 Union Budget.\nGold & Silver Rates Today\nTuesday, 27th January, 2026\nGold Rate in Mumbai Today\nTuesday, 27th January, 2026\nSilver Rate in Mumbai Today\nBase metals posted broadly positive performance, led by nickel, which climbed over 6% on renewed supply uncertainty after Indonesia signaled tighter ore quotas and stricter enforcement against illegal mining. Copper advanced more than 2% to finish above $13,100 per tonne, though prices retreated from intraday highs toward the week’s end. Lead was the sole underperformer, slipping nearly 1%.\nCopper reflected a rebalancing between lingering supply risks and improving near-term availability. Support came from production disruptions at Capstone Copper’s Mantoverde mine in Chile due to a labour strike, partially offset by progress toward restarting Freeport-McMoRan’s Grasberg operations. However, rising Comex inventories above 500,000 tons, global exchange stocks at their highest since 2018, and a deepening LME cash-to-three-month discount signaled easing tightness.\nWTI crude oil ended the week modestly higher, rebounding sharply on Friday to a one-week high of $61.4 per barrel after the US imposed new sanctions on vessels and firms transporting Iranian oil, reviving geopolitical risk. Prices had earlier slipped below $59 per barrel following optimism around potential Ukraine-Russia-US talks, before reversing as Iran-US tensions escalated.\nOn the daily chart, MCX Crude Oil futures saw a strong rally last Friday, closing above the prior swing high of Rs 5,613 per barrel. With the price currently above both the Supertrend (7,3) and the 20 EMA, the trend bias is bullish. Momentum is expected to continue upward next week, facing initial resistance near Rs 5,820, then Rs 5,900. Support on any pullback is positioned at Rs 5,400.\nWith Iran warning that any attack would be treated as “all-out war,” markets remain alert to the risk of disruptions through the Strait of Hormuz, which carries roughly 20% of global crude flows. Looking ahead, steady inflation and resilient consumer spending in the US are likely to keep the Fed on hold in the upcoming meeting, while Trump’s speech, US PPI, and durable goods data will shape policy expectations.",

        "full_content": "Silver crossed the $100 mark for the first time on Comex today (January 23) at 4:25 pm GMT, representing 4.24 percent gain from its previous close. The metal has been on a record spree driven by geopolitical concerns, especially around US-Iran relations, a weaker dollar, and a rise in industrial demand.\nOn MCX, silver domestic futures hit the record peak at Rs 3,41,300 per kilogram on Friday (11:21 am IST), and continued to hover at Rs 3,39,217, up 2.05 percent from the previous close of Rs 3,32,393. The price previously peaked at Rs 3,38,804 on January 22, as recorded on MCX.\nThe Indian Bullion Jewellers Association (IBJA) pegged silver's price at Rs 3,17,705 per kilogram on its 18:30 rate session, which is approximately a 6 percent gain from Rs 2,99,711 in the last 24 hours.\n“Silver touching the $100 per ounce on Comex is a powerful psychological milestone. The surge has been driven by a rare convergence of factors— geopolitical uncertainty, currency debasement, strong industrial demand, and speculative momentum following silver’s breakout to fresh all-time highs,” said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market, an online trading platform.\nWhy is silver up?\nSilver has been on a record spree driven by a historic short squeeze, strong retail participation, and China’s tightening export controls, adding to supply concerns.\nThe metal’s dramatic record surge to the triple digits comes just a day after investors rushed to book profits amid President Trump’s renewed stance on Greenland and withdrew proposed tariffs on European imports.\nMarket sentiment shifted after the US President Donald Trump said a fleet of American warships was heading to the Middle East and that Washington was watching Iran closely. A day before, Trump claimed that a NATO deal would give the US permanent access to Greenland, though specifics are still unclear. Meanwhile, as Trump pulled back from proposed tariffs against the EU countries, the day (January 22) saw a dip in prices.\nMeanwhile, markets look forward to another rate cut by the US Fed in their upcoming policy meeting scheduled on January 27-28.\nShould investors buy, hold, or sell?\nKhoo advises investors not to chase the rally blindly. “Price action at these levels is extremely sensitive. From a tactical perspective, short-term traders may consider booking partial profits or tightening stops, as volatility is likely to spike around the $100 handle.”\nFor long-term investors, silver still makes sense as a strategic hedge against monetary instability and as a beneficiary of structural demand from energy and technology sectors.\n“However, fresh buying is better deferred until a consolidation or pullback toward key support zones, rather than entering at euphoric highs. The bias remains constructive, but disciplined position management is crucial at current levels,” he added.\nThe Augmont Bullion, published on January 23, noted that silver prices have corrected but continue to act as strong support. “As long as silver trades above the $90.5 level (Rs 3,00,000), the metal retains the potential to move higher towards the $99-$100 range (Rs 3,45,000). Overall, dips are likely to attract buying interest rather than signal a trend reversal.”",

Gold also climbed to a fresh record, edging closer to $5,000 an ounce.\nInvestor demand for precious metals intensified during the first year of US President Donald Trump’s second term in the White House, amid growing uncertainties over trade, geopolitics and monetary policy. Worries that silver could be hit with US tariffs triggered a rush to ship metal to New York, culminating with a historic short squeeze in London in October.\nSilver’s advance this week was fueled by a rift in Washington’s relations with European allies, while the latest attempts to reach a deal to end the war in Ukraine have so far failed to reach a breakthrough. Challenges to the Federal Reserve’s independence have also fanned demand.\nMeanwhile, the global silver market has been in a supply deficit for five years. As prices push higher, there’s been a wave of retail buying. And in China, investors have piled into silver as an affordable alternative to gold, while in the US, there’s been a frenzy that’s overwhelmed dealers.\nSome banks had already forecast silver to break into three figures. In a January note, Citigroup Inc. upgraded its near-term outlook for a jump to $100 an ounce, along with a prediction that gold could surge to $5,000 an ounce.\nPrecious metals have also found support after Trump said he had concluded interviews for the next Federal Reserve chair, a move that has revived concerns about the central bank’s independence.\nThe metal’s climb came despite a decision by the US in January to hold off from imposing import tariffs on critical minerals. Trump said he would negotiate bilateral agreements to ensure adequate supplies of the materials, floating price floors, while not ruling out levies.\nIn addition to being a financial asset, silver also has a key industrial role given it’s an efficient conductor of electricity, with the solar industry a major buyer.\nStill, costlier prices have prompted some firms to cut back, with substitution and an anticipated slowdown in global solar installations,set to cut the sector’s silver consumption by about 17% this year, Shanghai Metals Market data show.\nSpot gold traded at $4,961.74 an ounce as of 11:02 a.m. in New York and is on track for an 8% weekly gain, its strongest performance since March 2020. Silver was 3.8% higher at $99.93 an ounce. Platinum also hit a record Friday.",

        "full_content": "Gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) have recorded a significant recovery on January 23 to resume their record rally, after a crash during the previous session. Analysts have suggested which precious metal sees more upside amid this volatility.\nTata Silver ETF, which had crashed up to 24 percent yesterday, hitting a low of Rs 25.56 apiece. The ETF rebounded sharply today, rising more than 17 percent to hit the day’s high at Rs 33 apiece. This marks a 29 percent jump from the low hit by the ETF earlier yesterday.\nGroww Gold ETF is currently the top gainer among all the gold ETFs. The ETFs jumped 7 percent to trade at Rs 155.97 apiece today. The sharp surge in gold and silver ETFs is a clear reflection of how aggressively investors are repositioning toward safe-haven assets amid heightened global uncertainty, said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market.\nShould you buy gold or silver?\nMotilal Oswal Financial Services in its latest note highlighted that silver has delivered an exceptional rally of over 200 percent in the past 12 months, sharply outperforming gold’s 80 percent rise during the same period. This made silver one of the strongest-performing assets globally.\nHowever, the domestic brokerage noted that this sharp outperformance of the white metal has led to a significant compression in the gold–silver ratio, which has fallen from pandemic highs of 127 to around 50 at the beginning of 2026.\n“This reset suggests that while the long-term outlook for precious metals remains constructive, the near-term risk-reward equation may now be shifting in favour of gold after silver’s outsized run,” Motilal said.\n“Silver has delivered sharp outperformance in a short span, and with the gold–silver ratio now near lower levels, the near-term risk-reward is turning more favourable for gold. While we remain positive on both metals and silver continues to have long-term upside backed by industrial demand and tight physical market conditions, the recent rally has also increased near-term volatility. In this phase, a higher allocation to gold can help manage fluctuations while staying invested in precious metals,” said Navneet Damani, Head of Research Commodities and Manav Modi, Commodities Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.\nHowever, the domestic brokerage emphasized that it does not have a negative view on silver. But, it suggests a risk-managed reallocation strategy after an aggressive up move. It added that silver has become more volatile with sharper price swings, while gold continues to offer relatively better stability—making it a preferred near-term hedge in uncertain market conditions.\nDespite the sharp surge in prices, global silver ETFs have seen outflows of over 3 million ounces since the start of 2026, while gold ETFs have witnessed comparatively steadier inflows, reflecting investor preference for more defensive positioning, Motilal added.\nThe brokerage advises investors a 75 percent allocation to gold and 25 percent to silver, indicating a preference for gold as a relatively steadier hedge in the current environment, while still retaining meaningful exposure to silver’s long-term structural upside.\n“Going forward, we believe investors can benefit from a rebalanced precious metals strategy—retaining silver as a long-term structural theme, while increasing gold allocation to manage near-term volatility and capture a potentially stronger risk-adjusted opportunity in the next phase of the cycle,” Damani said.\nLong-term investors may consider staggered allocation within asset allocation limits, while short-term traders should remain cautious amid continued volatility, said Aditya Agrawal, Chief Investment Officer at Avisa Wealth Creators.\nFollow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "Gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) rebounded sharply on January 23, recovering strong losses which were recorded earlier yesterday. Experts have commented on whether the rally in the precious metals will continue, and what lies ahead.\nNotably, today’s sharp recovery in ETFs come as precious metals soared to fresh all-time highs. The ETFs however are still away from their 52-week highs, which they had hit a day before yesterday before taking a breather from the rally.\nTata Silver ETF, which had crashed up to 24 percent yesterday, hitting a low of Rs 25.56 apiece. The ETF rebounded sharply today, rising more than 17 percent to hit the day’s high at Rs 33 apiece. This marks a 29 percent jump from the low hit by the ETF earlier yesterday.\nGroww Gold ETF is currently the top gainer among all the gold ETFs. The ETFs jumped 7 percent to trade at Rs 155.97 apiece today.\nThe sharp surge in gold and silver ETFs is a clear reflection of how aggressively investors are repositioning toward safe-haven assets amid heightened global uncertainty, said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market.\nShould you buy ETFs now?\nSpeaking about yesterday's crash, Prasenjit Paul, Equity Research Analyst at Paul Asset & Fund Manager at 129 Wealth Fund said that what unsettles investors on days like yesterday is not the fall in gold or silver, but the illusion of stability that ETFs create. “Precious metals are volatile assets, ETFs make them feel tradable like stocks, encouraging investors to react to daily price moves. The real risk is owning them without clarity on allocation or purpose or without a proper entry-exit plan,” he explained.\nPrecious metals experienced sharp volatility in late December 2025 and early January 2026. Despite price swings, the fundamentals of precious metals are compelling, driven by near-record industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles and AI infrastructure, said Tanvi Kanchan, Associate Director at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers.\n“Given the current geopolitical landscape—from ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine to U.S.-China tensions and uncertainty around trade policies under the new Trump administration—precious metals maintain their relevance as portfolio hedges. However, after such explosive gains in 2025, timing a single-entry point is treacherous,” the analyst said.\nAccording to Kanchan, investors should consider spreading purchases over the coming weeks or months, instead of deploying capital all at once. For conservative investors, allocating 5-10% of portfolios to precious metals ETFs through systematic purchases reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to an asset class that benefits from geopolitical instability and monetary policy uncertainty, she said.\nWhile the momentum remains intact, such elevated levels also increase the risk of short-term volatility and profit-taking, cautioned Khoo. The analyst added that ETF demand still suggests investor conviction in precious metals as a strategic hedge remains robust.\nGold or silver?\nMotilal Oswal believes the gold looks more favourable now, after silver's massive rally. \"Silver has delivered sharp outperformance in a short span, and with the gold–silver ratio now near lower levels, the near-term risk-reward is turning more favourable for gold. While we remain positive on both metals and silver continues to have long-term upside backed by industrial demand and tight physical market conditions, the recent rally has also increased near-term volatility,\" said Navneet Damani, Head of Research Commodities and Manav Modi, Commodities Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.\nThe analyst said that in this phase, a higher allocation to gold can help manage fluctuations while staying invested in precious metals.\nFollow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here.",

        "full_content": "Gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) rebounded sharply on January 23, rising as much as 17 percent as the precious metals regained ground after some correction.\nThis comes a day after the ETFs crashed significantly following a record rally, as tariff concerns eased. While the ETFs are still away from their recent highs, the precious metals surged to fresh lifetime highs.\nPrecious metals hit fresh all-time highs:\nGold futures with February expiry on MCX hit fresh all time high of Rs 1,59,226 per 10 grams. The contracts with April and June expiries also hit lifetime highs at Rs 1,68,000 per 10 grams and Rs 1,73,676 per 10 grams, respectively.\nSilver futures with March expiry jumped to a fresh all time high of Rs 3,39,927 per kilogram. The contracts with May and July expiries were also at all-time high levels. This comes after the contracts fell around 4 percent yesterday.\nCOMEX silver contract neared $100 per ounce and the gold contract neared $5,000 per ounce, as geopolitical tensions lingered even as US President Donald Trump walked back on his threats of imposing tariffs on European Union nations in his push to acquire Greenland.\nThe commodity prices also rose as the US dollar remained weak. The dollar remained down on Friday, to record its worst week so far in a year, after falling the most in a month in the US trading session. A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities such as gold cheaper for those holding other currencies, aiding demand.\nThe safe-haven demand for both precious metals continued to rise amid uncertainty around the Greenland issue despite Trump's statements about working towards a future deal. Details of the \"framework\" of the deal have been hazy, and European officials on Thursday appeared to be willing to talk about it only in vague terms, Dow Jones reported.\nEuropean Union leaders met for a summit late on Thursday after Trump stepped back from his threat to impose new tariffs over Greenland, Blomberg reported. While Trump's step back has removed the immediate threat to European economic and geopolitical sovereignty, leaders are beginning to sift through the longer-term implications, the report said.\nDuring the summit, European leaders said they wanted an EU-US trade deal to be back on track after the European Parliament suspended its ratification in protest over Trump's threats. However, Trump's threats shook Europe's confidence in its partner, Reuters reported, quoting EU officials and leaders as saying. \"Transatlantic relations have definitely taken a big blow over the last ‌week,\" the report quoted the bloc's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas as saying. While saying ‌they want to work on strengthening transatlantic cooperation, the EU leaders warned that they were ready to act if Trump was to threaten them again, the report said.\nGold ETFs:\nGroww Gold ETF, Invesco India Gold ETF, Motilal Oswal Gold ETF and Axis Gold ETF climbed around 4 percent each, while 360 ONE Gold ETF, Bandhan Gold ETF, Tata Gold ETF, Angel One Gold ETF, Zerodha Gold ETF, Quantum Gold ETF, ICICI Prudential Gold ETF, Edelweiss Gold ETF and Union Gold ETF meanwhile gained more than 3 percent each.\nLIC Mutual Fund Gold ETF, Nippon Gold ETF, Nippon India ETF Gold Bees, HDFC Gold ETF and others meanwhile gained around 3 percent each.\nSilver ETFs:\n360 ONE Silver ETF was the top gainer, jumping more than 10 percent, while Tata Silver ETF, which had crashed up to 24 percent yesterday, jumped 9 percent today. Mirae Asset Silver ETF, Axis Silver ETF, Edelweiss Silver ETF, Aditya Birla Sun Life Silver ETF, DSP Silver ETF, ICICI Prudential Silver ETF and others gained around 9 percent each.\nNippon India Silver ETF, HDFC Silver ETF, Zerodha Silver ETF and others gained more than 8 percent each.\nWhat lies ahead?\nDespite price swings, the fundamentals of the precious metals are compelling, driven by near-record industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles and AI infrastructure, said Tanvi Kanchan, Associate Director, Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers.\n\"Rather than deploying capital all at once, investors should consider spreading purchases over the coming weeks or months. This approach captures the dip while protecting against further corrections that could see silver test,\" the analyst said.\n\"For conservative investors, allocating 5-10% of portfolios to precious metals ETFs through systematic purchases reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to an asset class that benefits from geopolitical instability and monetary policy uncertainty. The structural deficits and industrial demand provide a floor, but expect continued volatility as the market digests 2025's historic run,\" she added.\nThe sharp surge in gold and silver ETFs is a clear reflection of how aggressively investors are repositioning toward safe-haven assets amid heightened global uncertainty, said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market.\n\"Gold prices trading near $4,950–$4,970 per ounce on COMEX, while silver rallies close to $99 per ounce, have pushed both metals firmly into record territory. This strength is being reinforced by a softer US dollar, persistent geopolitical tensions, and growing concerns around currency stability, all of which are driving strong ETF inflows as investors prefer liquid, regulated exposure. The move is equally striking, with gold prices approaching ₹1.6 lakh per 10 grams and silver nearing ₹3.5 lakh per kg, underscoring the global nature of the rally,\" the analyst said.\nWhile the momentum remains intact, such elevated levels also increase the risk of short-term volatility and profit-taking, Khoo said, adding that ETF demand still suggests investor conviction in precious metals as a strategic hedge remains robust.\nFollow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here.",

Silver hit a record high of Rs 3,35,521 on January 21.\nHere is how a kilogram of silver has moved.\nCity-wise silver prices\nSilver rates across India’s major cities showed remarkable uniformity, with only marginal differences due to local taxes, jeweller margins, and logistics costs.\nHow is silver down?\nProfit booking has played its role in the recent decline. Silver’s rapid descent, dropping nearly 8 percent from its record peak, underscores its role as a high-velocity gauge of global risk. The sudden 'Davos De-escalation,' marked by the withdrawal of tariff threats against European allies and a new NATO framework for the Arctic, has punctured the geopolitical bubble that drove the white metal to $95.\n\"The correction may continue as prices are still far from their immediate crucial support of the 20-DEMA level placed at 272,150. Also, Daily SAR is currently placed at 274,300. In the previous bull run, we have observed a decline in OI levels, which signifies a Long unwinding by traders in silver.\n\"Along with that, we have observed an RSI divergence in the daily chart, which is a classic 'Red flag' for building any fresh buying. We can observe an OI decline to 9650 lots so far, which signifies that there is no interest coming up for the long position with perspective to expiry from traders,\" said Aamir Makda, Commodity & Currency Analyst, Choice Broking.\nIs it the right time to buy silver?\n\"In our view, this is not the right time to buy Silver at this moment, as this fall may continue. If price stables over support levels, then traders may consider it as a buy-on-dips,\" Makda said.",

The price stood at $4,954 per ounce (1:55 am GMT), representing 0.84% gain from its previous close.\nOn MCX, the domestic futures price closed the Thursday session at Rs 1,56,540 per 10 grams of 24 carat purity, which is a 0.13 percent gain from its previous close at Rs 1,56,341. The metal surged to its peak performance at Rs 1,58,475 as recorded on MCX on January 21, 2025.\nGold was slightly under pressure on Thursday as the geopolitical risk sentiment triggered partial profit booking in Indian markets after comments from President Trump indicated that \"the US will have a good trade deal with India\".\n\"Gold’s record-breaking rally has hit a diplomatic speed bump. The pivot from aggressive tariff threats to a 'NATO framework' for Greenland has effectively dissolved the immediate geopolitical risk premium.

A key gauge of the US currency’s strength is down 0.8% so far this week.

        "full_content": "Silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) tumbled up to 24 percent in trade on January 22 amid easing tariff concerns. This came even as the future contracts of the precious metal fell only up to 4 percent on MCX.\nAnalysts have explained why ETFs saw a sharper crash than silver itself, and what investors should do in such times of decline.\nWhy silver ETFs fell more than silver itself?\nTata Silver Exchange Traded Fund saw the most decline on January 22, declining nearly 24 percent to its day's low of Rs 25.56 apiece before recovering some losses.\nSilver futures with March expiry meanwhile dropped 4 percent to its day's low before recovering some losses.\nThe sharper fall in silver ETFs compared to silver futures on MCX is largely a function of how Indian silver had moved into a speculative premium ahead of the Budget, rather than a sudden collapse in underlying global fundamentals, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS.\nHe highlighted how silver on MCX, which represents Indian prices, had outperformed COMEX levels, which represent global prices, over the past two sessions. The analyst explained that this was mainly driven by expectations around an import duty tweak or a policy signal in the Budget.\n\"At its peak, Indian silver was trading near $107 per ounce, almost $13 above the COMEX price of around $94, which is an unusually wide premium by historical standards,\" he said.\nDasani added that the premium that Indian silver prices enjoyed over global prices was not driven by physical tightness alone - it was largely sentiment-led and expectation-driven. \"Once it became clear that no immediate duty relief was forthcoming, that excess premium started unwinding,\" he said.\nExplaining the sharper fall in ETFs, Dasani said that they are priced off domestic spot benchmarks but also reflect investor flows and arbitrage pressures. Hence, they tend to react faster in such \"premium collapse\" phases. \"When retail investors rush to book profits, ETF units face additional selling pressure even if MCX futures are still stabilizing,\" he said.\n\"So what we are seeing is not a bearish signal on silver as an asset class, but a normalization of an India-specific price distortion that had built up ahead of a policy event,\" he added.\nHence, today’s fall shows that the ETF price is getting rationalised and more aligned with the actual market price of the metal. Amar Ranu, Head - Investment Products & Insights, Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers Limited, said, \"Gold and Silver ETFs saw significant drawdowns today...thereby bringing the ETF’s price almost in line with domestic physical and international market prices. (MCX prices of silver have dropped by 3% - 4%in comparison).\"\nWhat should you do?\nDespite price swings, fundamentals are compelling, driven by near-record industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles, and AI infrastructure, said Tanvi Kanchan, Associate Director, Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers.\nThe analyst however cautioned that after the record bull run, timing a single entry point is \"treacherous\". \"Rather than deploying capital all at once, investors should consider spreading purchases over the coming weeks or months.

The structural deficits and industrial demand provide a floor, but expect continued volatility as the market digests 2025's historic run,\" she added.\nTo check if a silver ETF is at premium or discount against MCX prices:\n1. Find daily NAV on AMC site (for example, Nippon India for Silver Bees) or NSE India/Moneycontrol.\n2. Compare to live market price on NSE/BSE.\nIf market price is greater than NAV, then the ETF is trading at a premium to MCX price. If it is lower than NAV, then the ETF is at a discount.\nFair NAV is calculated from MCX silver closing price minus expenses, and is updated daily by AMC.",

Motilal Oswal Silver ETF meanwhile gained more than 10 percent from its day’s low.\nGold ETFs also staged a partial recovery, with today’s top loser Birla Sun Life Gold ETF recovering around 6 percent from its day’s low.\nWhy are silver prices falling today?\nTrump said that he had reached the outlines of a deal with NATO on the island's future. \"Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in Davos. He did not give details of the deal.\nAdditionally, he also said that US will not use military force to seize Greenland. \"I won't do that,\" Trump said. \"Okay? Now everyone's saying 'oh, good' that's probably the biggest statement I made because people thought I would use force. I don't have to use force, I don't want to use force, I won't use force,” he added.\nEarlier, gold and silver prices had sharply shot up earlier after Trump threatened to use military force to acquire Greenland, triggering tensions between US and EU nations. The tariff threats further fuelled the geopolitical tensions, and thereby safe-haven assets like gold and silver due to a rise in risk-off sentiment.\nWhat should you do?\nDespite price swings, fundamentals are compelling, driven by near-record industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles, and AI infrastructure, said Tanvi Kanchan, Associate Director, Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers.\nThe analyst however cautioned that after the record bull run, timing a single entry point is \"treacherous\". \"Rather than deploying capital all at once, investors should consider spreading purchases over the coming weeks or months. This approach captures the dip while protecting against further corrections that could see silver test,\" she said.\n\"For conservative investors, allocating 5-10% of portfolios to precious metals ETFs through systematic purchases reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to an asset class that benefits from geopolitical instability and monetary policy uncertainty. The structural deficits and industrial demand provide a floor, but expect continued volatility as the market digests 2025's historic run,\" she added.\nFollow all LIVE updates from the stock markets.",

        "full_content": "Even as the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has been setting new records for transaction volume and value every month, with an annual growth rate of around 30 percent, the industry is expecting a higher subsidy for the ecosystem in the 2026 Union Budget.\nThe Payments Council of India and other payment companies have requested a higher subsidy for UPI from the finance ministry this year, according to three separate sources.\nDigital transactions carry what is called a merchant discount rate (MDR), a fee that banks collect from merchants at the point of sale for facilitating digital payments. UPI MDR was 30 basis points before the government waived it in 2020. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.\nTo promote the adoption of digital payments, the government mandated that UPI transactions remain free for users, and in return, it will compensate payment firms for the costs they bear to facilitate them.\n“Since there has been no announcement on MDR since the subsidy allocation, we would like to have a higher subsidy than was announced last year. But we are not sure what the government is planning. But for UPI to reach rural areas and new segments of population, MDR is essential,” said a senior executive with a payments firm that has been part of the process to reach out to the finance ministry\nHowever, last year, the central government announced Rs 1,500 crore as a subsidy for UPI transactions at merchants, as against the industry expectation of around Rs 5,000 crore.\nIn 2024, the government subsidy for UPI was Rs 3,500 crore. As per the government policy, it provides 15 basis points (bps) of subsidy for UPI transactions below Rs 2,000.\nIn 2025, the likely subsidy bill would have been around Rs 6,000 crore, indicating a shortfall of Rs 4,500 crore in FY 2025.\nUPI is the country’s most popular digital payment method, facilitating around 85 percent of all online transactions. The platform run by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) sees over 21.5 billion transactions in a month, worth over Rs 28 lakh crore.\n“The budget is a significant contributor to the continuity of UPI transactions being supported by zero MDR, in particular, for small-value merchant-to-client payments (M2C) for amounts up to Rs 2,000,” said Rohit Mahajan, founder and managing partner of PlutosOne, a technology infrastructure firm that works with payment firms.\nWith UPI becoming the primary option for conducting financial transactions, it is essential for both merchants and the industry to benefit from MDR subsidies, Mahajan said, adding, “For the payment firms to continue to develop in the direction of financial inclusion and support innovation in the next stage of India’s digital finance evolution, this needs to be addressed.”\nPCI, which represents payment and fintech companies, has requested the reintroduction of 30bps or 0.3 percent as MDR on UPI payments for large merchants. Large merchants are those with a turnover of over Rs 40 lakh annually.\nIt also demanded that the government consider MDR for all Rupay Debit card transactions, which aligns with the existing MDR structure for credit cards (around 2 percent) and for non-Rupay debit cards (around 0.75-0.9%).",

Now we feel more confident about how to handle it,\"he added.\nHe said Zoho believes it is now in a stronger position to both “AI-proof” and “AI-boost” its business, allowing it to resume geographic expansion.\nThe Uttar Pradesh move is expected to follow Zoho’s hub-and-spoke model, similar to its centres in smaller towns such as Tenkasi and Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu.\nSeparately, Vembu said Zoho continues to invest in semiconductor design but has put its semiconductor fabrication plant plans on hold. “We are investing in semiconductor design right now.\nThe fab plan has been paused because we have too many things going on, especially with AI. We will revisit it in a couple of years,” he said.\nHe added that building a chip fabrication unit is a capital- and resource-intensive exercise, and the company wants to prioritise its core software and AI strategy before taking on such a large-scale project.\nZoho’s semiconductor design efforts remain part of its long-term roadmap, but manufacturing will wait until the company has greater clarity and bandwidth.\nThe model was first implemented in Tenkasi in 2011, which later grew into one of Zoho’s most important development centres outside Chennai. Madurai functions as another regional hub within Tamil Nadu.\nBeyond Tamil Nadu, Zoho has expanded this approach to Andhra Pradesh, with Renigunta acting as a key centre, and has also begun building its presence in Uttar Pradesh, where the company has indicated that more focused expansion plans will follow.\nThe company has also set up operations in parts of Kerala, including smaller towns, in line with its decentralisation strategy.\nZoho has consistently said a significant portion of its workforce in such centres is hired locally, supported by internal training programmes such as Zoho Schools of Learning instead of conventional campus recruitment.",

        "full_content": "Former Google and Airbnb executive Peeyush Ranjan, who also served as CTO of Walmart-owned Flipkart, and Mukesh Bansal, co-founder of Myntra, on January 23 launched Fermi.ai, an AI-first edtech startup focused on high-school STEM education in India and the United States.\nThe startup, which has emerged from the Meraki Labs ecosystem, is headquartered in Singapore and operates through subsidiaries in India and the US. Fermi.ai is available free on the cloud, as the company remains in a pilot and product-discovery phase, Ranjan told Moneycontrol.\nThe launch comes at a time when the edtech sector is recalibrating after a funding boom-and-bust cycle, even as generative AI tools such as ChatGPT become deeply embedded in how students study. Ranjan said the company was built to address growing concerns that AI is increasingly being used as a shortcut rather than a learning aid.\n“Students are getting answers faster than ever but their understanding is getting weaker,” Ranjan said. “Learning happens through productive struggle. What we’ve tried to build is an AI tutor that supports that struggle instead of replacing it.”\nDesigned to guide, not give answers\nUnlike most AI-powered learning tools that surface solutions quickly, Fermi.ai is designed to withhold final answers, guiding students through problems step by step instead. The platform uses a stylus-first, canvas-based interface, allowing students to write equations, draw diagrams and work through reasoning in a format closer to pen-and-paper problem solving.\nThe product currently covers maths, physics and chemistry and is built around four core components: an adaptive real-time tutor, a handwriting-first canvas, a curriculum-linked concept graph with an exam-aligned question bank (including AP, IB and JEE), and diagnostic tools that show students and teachers where reasoning breaks down.\nBansal said the platform is meant to surface gaps in thinking rather than mask them. “AI can solve any equation but it can’t yet explain why a student’s logic failed at step three,” he said. “Fermi.ai is meant to show students how they think and give teachers visibility into silent struggles.”\nThe platform uses multiple large language models, including OpenAI and Google models, benchmarking each for different tasks and integrating them into a single system. Ranjan said the company does not train on school-owned data, with teacher-uploaded content remaining with institutions.\nPilot results and measured rollout\nBefore the rollout, Fermi.ai ran a three-month pilot with 79 students, covering more than 15,000 concept tests. According to data shared by the company, students who initially scored two out of ten or lower improved by an average of 4.68 points by their final attempts, while overall mastery scores rose by 2.6 points between early and later practice attempts.\nThe company is running pilots in Bengaluru, north India and Silicon Valley, with discussions underway to expand pilots to additional regions. While the platform is now accessible globally, Ranjan said the company will remain hands-on over the next few months rather than pursue aggressive scale.\n“We want to be sure we’re landing with a great product before we start scaling hard,” he said.\nMonetisation, funding and next steps\nDespite the launch, monetisation has not yet been finalised. Fermi.ai is currently free and pricing discussions are expected once product capabilities and customer segments are clearer. The likely model is per-student, per-seat pricing, with teachers accessing the platform at no cost.\nThe platform is positioned as a supplemental learning tool, acting as a teacher’s assistant in classrooms and as a standalone tutor outside school. It is designed to work on devices with a Chrome browser and stylus support, including Chromebooks and tablets, without requiring dedicated hardware investments.\nFermi.ai is fully funded by Meraki Labs and has not raised external capital. Ranjan said the company is not actively fundraising and will consider raising a dedicated round after finalising the product and pricing strategy.\nThe launch adds to the growing influence of the so-called “Flipkart mafia ”— former Flipkart founders and senior executives who have gone on to build and back startups across sectors. With Fermi.ai, Ranjan and Bansal are extending that operating experience into AI-driven education, even as many founders tread cautiously around mass-market K–12 plays.\nFor now, the founders say the focus is on refining the product and validating the model before scaling, as AI continues to reshape how students learn and how teachers respond.",

This marks the second liquidity event facilitated by the company within a year.\nJuspay plans to deploy the funds to expand its footprint across Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, Europe, the UK and North America.\nThe company will also invest in strengthening its payments infrastructure and advancing its artificial intelligence capabilities to improve merchant experience and internal productivity.\n“Our focus over the last decade has been on solving the core complexities of global payments through first-principles engineering and design,” said Sheetal Lalwani, co-founder and chief operating officer of Juspay.\n“This round reflects our growth and provides liquidity opportunities for our early investors and team members who have been part of this journey,\" he added.\nWhy did WestBridge invest in Juspay?\nWestBridge Capital said Juspay’s evolution into a full-stack payments infrastructure provider was a key factor behind the investment.\n“They have moved from payment orchestration to building core payments infrastructure for banks and enterprises, while maintaining a sustainable growth trajectory,” said Deepak Ramineedi, partner at WestBridge Capital.\nWhat does Juspay do?\nFounded in 2012, Juspay provides payment infrastructure to enterprises and banks, enabling them to process large-scale digital transactions reliably.\nIn April 2025, Juspay secured $60 million in a Series D ongoing funding round led by private equity firm Kedaara Capital. The round included a mix of primary and secondary investments, with participation from existing backers SoftBank and Accel.\nThe company processes over 300 million transactions daily and has crossed an annualised total payment volume of $1 trillion. Its customers include companies such as Agoda, Amazon, Flipkart, Google, HSBC, IndiGo, Swiggy, Zepto and Zurich Insurance.\nJuspay said it is focused on building open, interoperable and modular payments infrastructure that can support global commerce at scale. It is also investing in artificial intelligence to improve efficiency across operations and merchant-facing platforms.\nJuspay turned profitable in FY25, reporting a profit of Rs 115 crore before exceptional items and tax. Revenue from operations rose 61 per cent year-on-year to Rs 514 crore, driven by higher digital transaction volumes and operational efficiencies.\nIn FY25, Juspay recorded a Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs 27 crore and a Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs 62 crore. The PAT figure is higher than PBT due to deferred tax adjustments.",

In about eight years its assets under management (AUM) has already crossed the $1 billion mark, as per Kapoor.\n“India, both in terms of performance and growth, has been actually one of our stronger performing markets…it continues to be one of our top three conviction markets going forward,” he said.\nMore recently it also raised a Rs 5,000 crore fund which is expected to be deployed “relatively quickly” indicating a more aggressive pace for Investcorp in India.\nWhile several investors look to invest in data centres in India, Investcorp is staying away from that theme, at least for now.\n“There is so much capital that has gone into data centres that it has compressed returns to levels where they are not necessarily the most optimal for our investors,” Kapoor said.\n“So, instead, the broader agenda around AI, cloud computing, digital architecture and infrastructure and digitisation of corporate value chains is what we are liking a lot,” he concluded.",

He will be based in the United States and report to Pocket FM co-founder Prateek Dixit.\nSharma previously worked at Meta’s Facebook AI Research (FAIR) unit for nearly three and a half years, where he contributed to several multimodal and large language model projects.\nThis includes the frontier open AI model Llama, as well as Chameleon, MaVIL (Masked Audio-Video Learners), and various next-generation audio-video foundation models. He was with the social networking giant. He also held positions at Citadel and Amazon Lab126.\nWhat will Vasu Sharma's key focus areas be at Pocket FM?\nDixit told Moneycontrol that Sharma's primary focus will be building underlying foundational models and modules to bolster existing products, particularly the AI-powered writing assistant CoPilot.\nSharma will play a crucial role in developing new fiction-writing models, building creator-first AI tools, and scaling high-quality AI-assisted production workflows while maintaining a human-first ethos.\nHe will also look at areas such as multimodal content generation through company initiatives like Blaze, an AI-powered studio that helps creators convert text into comics.\nAdditionally, Sharma will be responsible for hiring and building the company's research and applied AI base to set up a full-fledged presence in the United States, Dixit said.\n\"Pocket FM sits at a rare intersection of AI, creativity and global storytelling. Very few companies in the world have this combination of scale, AI and a mature creator ecosystem,\" Sharma said.\n\"My focus will be to advance the Pocket LLMs and evolve the AI CoPilot into the definitive creative assistant for writers everywhere, helping them ideate richer plots, preserve voice and emotional cadence, and localise stories with cultural precision. Our ultimate objective is to unlock a new generation of IPs, powered by AI and enabled by humans,\" he added.\nRead: Pocket FM now lets Hindi writers in India create AI audio series in a single click\nWhy is Pocket FM building AI models?\nSharma noted that existing foundational AI models are generally English-centric and not designed for story writing.\n\"This needs a fundamental research scope, where we build models from the ground up to suit our use cases. That involves significant core AI research and development: how to train these models, how to get the data, and how to evaluate them. There’s a lot of core foundational work that goes into it,\" he said.\nCurrently, CoPilot and the Pocket LLMs underpin the company's creative workflow, facilitating everything from story ideation and drafting to plot design, collaborating with other writers, editing, emotional toning, and multi-language adaptation with support for over 10 languages.\n\"When we talk to hobby writers, they have great ideas but developing a full-fledged long-form story is always a challenge. That will be the key focus point for us,\" Dixit said.\nGoing forward, the startup plans to develop multimodal capabilities across various formats such as voice, videos, and language.\nWhy are Pocket LLMs needed?\nDixit noted that while AI chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT are effective at writing shorter stories, complexity increases with long-form stories spanning 500-600 hours \"Not just coherency or fluency, even the logical consistency becomes a challenge over time,\" he said.\nIn terms of AI video creation, Sharma said the barrier to video production has lowered significantly, hence the company aims to capture that potential, starting with anime-based videos and eventually moving to full-fledged live-action dramas.\n\"We just want to democratise people's creative thoughts and ideas, and how quickly they can go from a thought to something tangible that they can share with the world,\" he said.\nWhat does Pocket FM do?\nPocket FM is the flagship product of Pocket Entertainment, which also operates the bite-sized online novel app Pocket Novel, the AI-first webcomics platform Pocket Toons, and the micro-drama app Pocket TV.\nThe service offers more than 100,000 audio series, spanning genres such as romance, drama, thriller, fantasy and science fiction, from a community of over 300,000 writers worldwide.\nThe platform claims to have over 250 million listeners who on average spend more than 125 minutes a day.\nStarted by Dixit, Rohan Nayak and Nishanth KS, Pocket Entertainment was last valued at $750 million when it raised $103 million in March 2024.

        "full_content": "Travel gear startup Escape Plan has raised $25 million in a Series A funding round led by existing investor Jungle Ventures, with participation from Fireside Ventures and IndiGo Ventures, the corporate venture capital arm of IndiGo Airlines, which has joined the company as a strategic investor.\nHow will Escape Plan use the fresh capital?\nThe fresh capital will be deployed primarily towards accelerating offline retail expansion, strengthening supply-chain and pricing capabilities to lower category price points, and widening Escape Plan’s reach beyond the top 25–30 percent of India, founder and CEO Abhinav Pathak told Moneycontrol. The company will also invest in technology to improve availability and consistency across channels, while expanding into adjacent travel categories.\n“Once we started hitting meaningful scale, the idea was to start building new territories, new categories and new geographies,” Pathak said. “That was the intent of the fundraise. We’re still a very lean team, so we also wanted to double down on building the organisation the right way.”\nWho backed the round—and what is the funding history?\nThe Series A comes less than a year after Escape Plan raised $5 million in a seed round led by Jungle Ventures with participation from Fireside Ventures in July last year, barely two months after the company began operations.\nBoth Jungle Ventures and Fireside Ventures are existing investors who have doubled down in the Series A, while IndiGo Ventures has come in as a new, strategic investor.\nPathak said the fundraising process was swift. “From the first conversation to money in the bank, it took hardly two to two-and-a-half months,” he said.\nHow big is Escape Plan today?\nFounded by Pathak, who earlier built retail-tech startup Perpule (acquired by Amazon), Escape Plan is positioning itself not as a single-brand luggage player but as a platform-led travel products company, spanning online marketplaces, direct-to-consumer channels and a growing offline retail network.\nThe company is currently operating at a Rs 300 crore-plus annualised revenue run rate, driven largely by luggage sales across channels. Escape Plan operates 25-plus offline stores, serves 6–7 lakh customers, and ships around two lakh pieces of luggage every month, according to the founder.\nWhat is driving revenues, and how is the product mix evolving?\nLuggage remains Escape Plan’s largest revenue contributor, but the company is now expanding into softer travel categories, including travel accessories such as neck pillows and passport covers.\n“Over the next six months, we’ll bring all possible travel categories under Escape Plan,” Pathak said. “Today, we are very luggage-first, but that will change.”\nHow aggressive is the offline expansion plan?\nA significant portion of the Series A capital will be channeled into expanding Escape Plan’s physical retail footprint, with the company targeting 200-plus stores over time.\nThe focus, Pathak said, is on unlocking markets where the company has so far been constrained by price points or limited physical presence.\n“Today, we are restricted to the top 25–30 percent of India by geography,” he said. “The goal is to start playing in 90 percent of India. That means pulling multiple levers—pricing, stores, ecommerce penetration and marketing.”\nWhat does IndiGo Ventures bring to the table?\nIndiGo Ventures’ participation adds a strategic layer to the round, even as the specifics of collaboration are still evolving. IndiGo said Escape Plan’s focus on reliability, scale and customer experience aligns with the rapid expansion of air travel in India.\nWhat are the challenges in scaling travel gear in India?\nDespite its rapid growth, Pathak acknowledged the structural challenges of the travel gear market, which grows largely at inflationary rates and has long been dominated by incumbents.\n“Once you hit Rs 300–500 crore in revenue, you become a meaningful part of the category,” he said. “From there, growth becomes harder, and mistakes become very expensive.”\nBrand or platform—what is Escape Plan really building?\nEscape Plan’s long-term bet is that category-led, platform-style ownership, rather than single-brand D2C plays, will create defensibility in travel gear.\n“Everyone else is building brands. We’re building a platform,” Pathak said. “Like Decathlon for sports or Lenskart for eyewear, we want to solve for every travel need, across price points and geographies.”",

        "full_content": "“A large part of Blinkit’s turnaround in recent months is certainly because of Deepinder’s operating muscle. He’s an execution machine and knows how to get stuff done the right way,” a senior executive who has worked closely with Blinkit chief Albinder Dhindsa told Moneycontrol early last year.\nThe executive paused before adding a caveat that, in many ways, summed up how the industry had long viewed Blinkit’s leadership equation. Dhindsa, he added, was “a solid guy”, but the contrast was hard to ignore. Why hadn’t the same results shown up during the Grofers years? And how had Blinkit suddenly begun firing on all cylinders?\nVersions of that assessment, sometimes kinder and sometimes sharper, have circulated quietly across the startup ecosystem. For years, many industry stakeholders believed that Eternal founder Deepinder Goyal was the brain and the engine, the operator who stepped in when things needed fixing, while Dhindsa played a more muted, secondary role, particularly after Blinkit was acquired by Zomato.\nOn January 21, Eternal’s board decisively upended that long-held perception.\nIn a move that closes one chapter of India’s consumer internet story and opens another, Goyal stepped aside as Group CEO, naming Dhindsa as his successor. For a founder who was asked to step down, twice, in three years, after the Blinkit acquisition, the appointment is less a sudden elevation and more the culmination of a decade-long test of endurance, execution and relevance inside one of India’s most unforgiving businesses.\nA relationship forged long before startups\nThe Dhindsa–Goyal story predates venture capital, valuations and quick commerce.\nAs chronicled in Unseen: The Untold Story of Deepinder Goyal and the Making of Zomato, the two first met as teenagers at a National Talent Search Examination (NTSE) camp in Chandigarh in the late 1990s. Dhindsa, from Patiala, and Goyal, from Muktsar, were among high-performing students suddenly stripped of hometown validation and thrown into a fiercely competitive environment.\nFrom school mates to studying at the prestigious IIT Delhi, the duo had endured one tough lesson: progress would be incremental, and nothing would be guaranteed.\nThat shared grounding - competitive, bruising and formative - shaped a relationship built less on hierarchy and more on mutual testing under pressure, a dynamic that would resurface repeatedly in their professional lives.\nThe familiarity ran deeper than friendship alone. Dhindsa’s wife, Akriti Chopra, was among Zomato’s early co-founders, part of the core team during the company’s formative years. As a result, Dhindsa’s association with Zomato, and with Goyal, was never episodic or transactional, but rooted in shared institutional memory of building the company from scratch.\nThose overlapping personal and professional ties meant that even as Dhindsa went on to chart his own path, the trust between the two founders was tested, strained and recalibrated, but never absent.\nDifferent instincts, early on\nDhindsa’s professional path diverged early from the archetypal consumer-internet founder.\nAfter IIT Delhi, he worked as a transportation analyst at URS Corporation and later as a senior associate at Cambridge Systematics, focusing on infrastructure planning, logistics modelling and network optimisation. He went on to earn an MBA from Columbia Business School, with a brief stint at UBS Investment Bank in New York, as per his LinkedIn profile.\nThe pattern was clear: Dhindsa gravitated toward systems, cost structures and execution, not visibility or evangelism.\nIn December 2011, he joined Zomato as head of international operations, working closely with Goyal during the company’s aggressive global expansion phase. By May 2014, he left to build Grofers.\nGrofers and the long, uneven build\nGrofers was never a linear success story.\nFounded as a hyperlocal delivery platform, it cycled through multiple models — neighbourhood pick-ups, marketplace grocery, inventory-led commerce — often ahead of consumer adoption and ecosystem readiness. For much of its early life, Grofers struggled to find sustained product-market fit and viable unit economics.\nDhindsa raised capital, pivoted repeatedly and stayed largely out of the spotlight. Compared with peers, Grofers often looked perennially stuck.\nThe pandemic, and what followed, changed the trajectory.\nBlinkit, Zomato — and the “Z factor”\nIn 2021, Grofers rebranded as Blinkit and made an aggressive bet on dark stores and ultra-fast delivery. Zomato soon followed with a stake purchase and then a full acquisition.\nAfter Zomato bought a 10 percent stake in Blinkit in March 2022, Deepinder Goyal spent the next several months closely examining the company’s inner workings to assess whether it could realistically be turned around.\n“Only after spending nearly six months diving deep into Blinkit’s operations did he get convinced that the business could be fixed. That’s when Zomato decided to go ahead with the acquisition,” an industry executive had told Moneycontrol earlier.\nFrom being acquired for just $568 million in 2022 to now being worth a significant portion of Eternal’s $30 billion empire, Blinkit, being quick commerce’s market leader, is on a tear.\nExecutives familiar with the process say Goyal’s reputation for fast decision-making and aggressive cost control — already visible in Zomato’s own turnaround and run of profitability — shaped Blinkit’s operating reset. Zomato’s capital, data stack and the backing of Hyperpure, its wholesale arm, strengthened Blinkit’s inventory backbone at a critical juncture.\nThe perception hardened: Blinkit was improving, but many believed Zomato, and Goyal, were the decisive force.\nThe reckoning inside Blinkit\nThat belief was not confined to the outside.\nIn a recent podcast with Raj Shamani, Goyal said he had asked Dhindsa to step down as Blinkit CEO twice after the acquisition. The period, he said, marked “rock bottom”, and he doubted whether Dhindsa could operate within Zomato’s structure at the pace required.\nDhindsa agreed, according to Goyal, but did not leave. Instead, he stayed on and rebuilt.\nThe turnaround that changed the conversation\nOver the next two years, Blinkit’s performance shifted materially.\nThe company tightened dark-store economics, improved inventory predictability, reduced stock-outs and built repeatable city-level density. By 2024, Blinkit had emerged as Eternal’s fastest-growing vertical and a central pillar of its investor narrative.\nThis was not a cosmetic turnaround. It required relentless execution across supply-chain design, operating cadence and cost discipline — areas Dhindsa had spent his career working in.\nIn his letter to shareholders announcing the leadership change, Goyal acknowledged this explicitly. Blinkit’s journey from acquisition to breakeven, he wrote, happened under Dhindsa’s leadership, crediting him with building the team, culture, supply chain and operating rhythm.\n“He has the DNA of a battle-hardened founder and his ability to execute far exceeds mine,” Goyal said.\nBlinkit at the centre of Eternal’s future\nWell before the leadership transition, Goyal had publicly framed Blinkit as central to Eternal’s next phase.\nSpeaking at Startup Mahakumbh in March 2024, he described quick commerce as part of what he called “Zomato version 4”.\n“Blinkit is a part of Zomato version 4, and in one year’s time, Blinkit would be bigger than Zomato. So, I don’t know for how long Zomato will have its relevance,” Goyal said.\nThat prediction came true.\nThe remark also underscored why a leader steeped in execution — not just strategy — would become indispensable to the group’s future.\nA parallel shift in focus\nThe transition also reflects how Goyal’s focus has broadened in recent years.\nEven as he remains vice chairman of Eternal, Goyal has invested $25 million from his personal wealth to Continue, his longevity-focused initiative, invested in and is raising $50 million for Temple, his wearable technology startup, and taken an active role in LAT Aerospace. He has also led or participated in funding rounds in deep-tech and space startups such as Pixxel, Moneycontrol had exclusively reported earlier.\nIn his shareholder letter, Goyal acknowledged that running a public company demands singular focus and risk discipline — constraints that sit uneasily with his appetite for experimentation.\nWhy Dhindsa, despite everything\nEternal today is no longer a single-product company. It is a public-market institution balancing mature cash flows with capital-intensive growth bets. The next phase is less about ideation and more about execution under scrutiny.\nDhindsa’s rise, then, is not accidental.\nHe was underestimated — by the market, by peers, and at one point, by the founder who would later appoint him Group CEO. He ran a company that looked stuck until the ecosystem caught up. He stayed through an acquisition that nearly ended his leadership role.\nAnd then, he showed his execution chops.\nIn stepping into Eternal’s top job in a matter of a few days, Albinder Dhindsa is not replacing Deepinder Goyal so much as completing a cycle that began decades ago in a classroom in Chandigarh — two students navigating failure, pressure and ambition side by side.\nThe industry may still debate who the “brains” are. Eternal’s board has made its call on who runs the machine.",

Albinder Dhindsa (Albi) will be Eternal's new Group CEO,” Goyal said in his letter to shareholders.\nThis decision comes as Goyal explores different ideas. “Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation. These are the kinds of ideas that are better pursued outside a public company like Eternal,” he said in his letter.\n“If these ideas belonged inside Eternal’s strategic scope, I would have pursued them within the company. They do not.”\nMoneycontrol has reported in the past Goyal has been spending more time raising funds for his other ventures. In December, Moneycontrol exclusively reported Goyal is raising $50 million for Temple, his wearables startup, from early investors of Zomato.\nGoyal is also likely to lead a new funding in Pixxel, a space tech company, by investing around $25 million personally, Moneycontrol had exclusively reported earlier this month.\nGoyal also runs Continue, a longevity focused research arm and LAT Aerospace, an aviation company meant for short duration flights.\n\"This transition allows Eternal to remain sharply focused, while giving me the space to explore ideas that do not fit Eternal’s risk profile,\" he told shareholders.\nHis fortunes will however be largely tied to Eternal's financial performance.\n\"My financial future remains meaningfully tied to Eternal, and my incentives remain aligned with long-term shareholder value creation. As part of this transition, all of my unvested ESOPs will revert to the ESOP pool. This ensures that Eternal continues to have meaningful wealth-creation opportunities for its next generation of leaders, while strengthening long-term retention without incremental shareholder dilution,\" his letter read.\nHe however allayed concerns and said he will continue to oversee operations, this transition is a mere change in title.\n\"The centre of gravity for operating decisions moves to Albi. As Group CEO, he will own day-to-day\nexecution, operating priorities, and business decisions. Blinkit's journey from acquisition to breakeven happened under his leadership.

        "full_content": "Swiggy-backed ride-hailing unicorn Rapido crossed the Rs 900 crore revenue milestone in FY25 while sharply cutting its losses, signalling improving operating leverage as its mobility and delivery businesses scaled up.\nRoppen Transportation Services, which runs the Rapido platform, reported operating revenue of Rs 934.4 crore for the year ended March 2025, a 44 percent rise from Rs 648.1 crore in FY24. Total income, including other income, stood at Rs 1,002.9 crore, compared with Rs 695.3 crore in the previous year.\nThe company reduced its net loss by about 30 percent to Rs 258.4 crore in FY25 from a loss of Rs 370.7 crore in FY24, even as expenses rose with higher activity levels. Total expenses increased to Rs 1,261.3 crore in FY25 from Rs 1,066 crore a year ago.\nEven though Rapido’s total expenses rose in FY25, its performance improved because revenues grew at a much faster pace, creating operating leverage.\nEmployee benefit expenses climbed to Rs 207 crore from Rs 172.5 crore, reflecting higher headcount and stock-based compensation. Other expenses, which include rider incentives, marketing, platform costs and operational spending, rose to Rs 1,048.7 crore from Rs 887 crore in FY24. Finance costs remained low at Rs 5.6 crore, while depreciation and amortisation stood at Rs 50.5 crore.\nIn FY24, Rapido had posted operating revenue of Rs 648 crore, up nearly 46 percent year-on-year, and had cut its losses to Rs 371 crore from Rs 675 crore in FY23, driven by tighter control over employee and marketing expenses.\nFounded in 2015 by Aravind Sanka, Pavan Guntupalli and Rishikesh SR, the Hyderabad-based company operates across bike taxis, auto-rickshaws, cabs and hyperlocal parcel delivery, and competes with Ola, Uber and Namma Yatri in India’s crowded ride-hailing market.\nRapido entered the unicorn club in July 2024 after raising about $120 million (around Rs 1,000 crore) in a Series E round led by WestBridge Capital. Earlier, it raised $180 million in a Series D round in April 2022 led by Swiggy, with participation from TVS Motor Company, Shell Ventures, Nexus Venture Partners and WestBridge.\nThe stronger financial performance comes as Rapido has launched Ownly, its food delivery app, starting with Bengaluru’s Koramangala, HSR Layout and BTM Layout. The company is making its first large push into a market dominated by Zomato and Swiggy.\nOwnly has been positioned as a zero-commission platform, offering customers meals at offline-equivalent prices while allowing restaurants to avoid high platform fees and hidden charges. The service has started in these three neighbourhoods and will be expanded to other parts of the city in phases.\nRapido plans to fulfil food orders using its existing bike taxi rider network. The company operates in over 500 cities, completes about 4 million rides every month and has nearly 30 million monthly active users. It believes lowering the overall cost of ordering food online will help attract price-sensitive customers who have been impacted by rising platform charges and restaurant mark-ups.\nSeparately, investor activity around the company has also picked up. In November 2025, TVS Motor Company said it had entered into an agreement to sell shares worth Rs 287.93 crore in Rapido to Accel. Moneycontrol had first reported on September 24 that Accel was in talks to invest in Rapido along with Prosus.\nAs part of the transaction, TVS Motor will sell 11,997 Series D compulsorily convertible preference shares (CCPS) to Accel India VIII (Mauritius) for Rs 143.96 crore, and 10 equity shares along with 11,988 Series D CCPS to MIH Investments One BV, an arm of Prosus, for Rs 143.97 crore, according to a stock exchange filing.",

It counts CRED, PharmEasy, Shiprocket, Flipkart, and Shell among its clients. The voice agents operate across 18 languages, including 10 Indian languages, as well as English, Arabic, Spanish, French, German, and Bahasa.\nThe startup plans to launch three new products, including call-deflection agents, an AI-native CRM with a memory layer, and an app store for community-built workflows.\nArkam Ventures managing director Rahul Chandra said, “AI is super charging the way enterprises deploy their voice stack across processes. Voice, with its natural ease of adoption opens the enterprise to far greater levels of automation than what pre-AI voice era allowed for. Ringg.ai has the distinction of being live across the most number of scaled up enterprise use cases compared to peers\".\nRingg AI had earlier raised seed funding from Capital2B and angel investors.",

        "full_content": "India continues to stand out as a key growth market, Mahindra Group managing director and chief executive officer Anish Shah told Moneycontrol at the World Economic Forum 2026 in Davos.\n“Perception on India is continuously very positive because India is a bright spot from a growth standpoint,” Shah said, adding the country is likely to remain a major growth destination for companies worldwide.\nShah said global trade conditions will play a critical role in shaping growth opportunities for conglomerates such as Mahindra.\n“Having tariff barriers removed clearly will help and that is something that we are looking for,” he said, referring to ongoing discussions around trade with the US and the European Union. Lower trade friction would support competitiveness and cross-border expansion of Indian manufacturers, he said.\nDespite geopolitical uncertainty, Mahindra continues to see strong traction across its businesses. “Auto as well as other businesses are continuing to see great demand,” Shah said, noting that the group is preparing to add capacity to meet sustained market needs. The outlook remains positive across automotive, farm equipment and other industrial segments, supported by steady domestic consumption.\nOn capital allocation, Shah said Mahindra’s approach is driven by long-term competitiveness rather than trade-offs between businesses. The group continues to back its “growth gems”, a portfolio of high-performing companies that have seen a sharp rise in valuation over recent years. “We continue to invest in our growth gems, and we feel that they have potential to grow even more significantly from here,” he said.\nShah also highlighted the increasing role of artificial intelligence across Mahindra’s operations. While productivity gains dominate global discussions on AI, he said Mahindra is seeing strong impact in quality improvement and plant efficiency. “We see a lot more benefits from quality, from uptime of plants,” he said, adding AI is being deployed across manufacturing processes from paint shops to welding applications, helping improve energy efficiency and operational reliability.\nRecent Union Budgets have laid a strong foundation for long-term growth, Shah said, batting  for continuity. “We have seen some very good budgets over the last few years,” he said, pointing to the focus on capital expenditure, infrastructure creation and fiscal discipline. Continuity in this direction would be supportive for industrial expansion and private investment, he said.\nShah said Mahindra’s ability to navigate volatility comes from decentralised decision-making and strong leadership across businesses, allowing the group to stay resilient and growth-focused even in an uncertain global environment.",

It’s in a very competitive space but we are the market leader there,” Shah said, adding Mahindra holds over 40 percent market share in the segment.\n“That is a business that we feel is almost ready for an IPO. Within the next year it will be and we shall then take it to market then,\" he said, as he also highlighted momentum across Mahindra’s core automotive and industrial businesses.\nHe said demand across the auto and farm equipment segments continues to remain strong. “Auto as well as other businesses are continuing to see great demand, and we are now looking at adding more capacity,” he said.\nShah said Mahindra’s aerostructures business has emerged as a fast-growing vertical. “The business is growing at a very rapid pace,” he said, adding the immediate priority is maintaining quality execution. Mahindra has won $1.2 billion worth of aerostructure orders in the last 12 months and Shah said the focus now is on delivering “a very high level of quality” before pursuing further expansion.\nOn rare earths, Shah said Mahindra’s primary interest is as a consumer rather than a direct investor. The company uses permanent magnets in its motors, especially for electric vehicles.\n“Our play is to offer long-term contracts and commit to paying a slightly higher price to ensure stability of supply,” he said, noting this is critical for building domestic self-sufficiency in the sector.\nMahindra, he said, remains focused on scaling businesses with strong fundamentals and long-term growth visibility.",

He said the India team remains active and will sign more deals this year. “We are excited to see the AI businesses coming out of India, especially AI services businesses which will build on the IT services background that India has…you'll see more out of us in 2026.”\nMore IPOs\nThe Indian startup ecosystem, the third-largest in the world, needs to see more companies going public, more firms being acquired by larger rivals and more share sales by existing shareholders, as per Ganguly.\n“IPOs can only do so much. We need to see more M&As, we need to see more secondaries. The maturing of the Indian venture capital ecosystem will lead to more liquidity coming in,” he said in the interview.\n“However, the ecosystem has made huge strides over the last couple of years, and the domestic IPO market is largely responsible for that.\"\nALSO READ: Davos 2026: AIF structure in India’s GIFT City has been a phenomenal regime for Kedaara, says chief Manish Kejriwal\nA part of the reason why B Capital has stayed away from India is also because some of its portfolio companies did not yield desired results in the recent years.\n“Startups have learnt lessons, but more importantly, we as investors have learnt lessons...the whole investor ecosystem has learnt a lot...and governance is key because governance in India and governance in emerging markets is something that keeps foreign investors away.”",

You have to fight for the deposits,” he said, adding that the efforts of the Reserve Bank of India and the government are helping to shore up the deposit growth, will help sustain the healthy credit growth.\n“RBI confirming and repeatedly assuring everyone that they will bring about a durable liquidity in the market, and the government hopefully starts funding again, you will see deposit growth inching up slowly from here. It could take some time, but my hope is it has to inch up,” Chaudhry said.\nHowever, he warned that if the deposit growth does not grow as expected, it will have an impact on the credit growth and could ultimately start impacting the economic growth.\nConsolidation and foreign investment\nThe Indian banking sector has attracted interest from overseas financial institutions over the last year and could help in the consolidation of the industry.\n“That also brings stability and kind of a lot of growth capital to some of these banks. The government is also talking about merging some of the larger public sector banks to create the bigger banks,” Chaudhry said.\nImproving asset quality could also facilitate the growth of the industry, and the retail asset quality improves dramatically as banks strengthen their underwriting.\nExpectation from the budget\nChaudhry also expects the union budget to move towards fiscal consolidation even as they spur the capital expenditure cycle.\nSome support needs to be provided to the MSMEs who have lost out in this whole tariff cycle.\n“The fundamental question is what they are doing in pushing Research & Development, pushing startup ventures. Can they do much more than what is being done at this stage? We are definitely falling behind to some extent,” Chaudhry said.\nHe pointed out that India should not fall into the middle-income trap.\n“We need global patents, global brands coming out of India. And at the pace at which it is happening today, I might not be sufficient. So we need to do more,” he added.",

        "full_content": "Bharat Forge chairman and managing director Amit Kalyani said rising tariffs risk making manufacturing uncompetitive and added that India’s upcoming Union Budget must focus on easing pressure on exporters, boosting research and development, and lowering the overall cost of doing business.\n“Increasing tariffs increases the cost base for critical inputs, makes you uncompetitive, leads to inflation, and reduces demand,” Kalyani told Moneycontrol on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. He said the US also faces structural constraints in raw material availability.\n“They do not have aluminum smelters and only do secondary processing. The price differential of steel and aluminum in the US versus the rest of the world is a big dampener on competitiveness,” he said.\nKalyani said while local manufacturing is becoming essential in the US, especially for passenger vehicles under USMCA and ‘Make in the US’ norms, higher input costs could hurt long-term competitiveness in critical sectors such as aerospace and automotive.\nOn Budget expectations, Kalyani said the government must support companies affected by export tariffs and significantly step up incentives for innovation.\n“There should be incentives for research and development because we are far behind China and many other countries,” he said. He also called for a reduction in the cost of doing business. “The cost of energy, manpower, infrastructure, and the quality of infrastructure need to improve substantially,” he added.\nKalyani said India is entering a multi-decade growth phase similar to what China experienced between the mid-1990s and 2020. “India will grow from close to $5 trillion to $20–25 trillion over the next 20 years. That creates huge opportunities,” he said, adding that the absence of mega manufacturing companies presents an opening for firms with technology, capital, and execution capabilities.\nHe said growth at Bharat Forge will come from multiple sectors including automotive, industrials, defence, rail, marine, and emerging areas like unmanned systems.\nOn artificial intelligence, Kalyani said industrial AI will be a major force multiplier. “AI will help India bridge knowledge and time gaps. It will reduce non–value-added work and improve productivity,” he said, adding that AI adoption in Indian companies is already ahead of much of Europe.\n“We are far ahead of Europe in AI adoption, and that creates an opportunity for Indian companies to partner globally and accelerate digital transformation,” he said.",

        "full_content": "Bajaj General Insurance company is addressing 95 percent of customer grievances through generative Artificial Intelligence chatbots, managing director and CEO Tapan Singhel told Moneycontrol on January 20 at the Davos World Economic Forum.\nHe pointed out that the achievement has been complemented by one of the highest Net Promoter Scores (NPS) or customer satisfaction with the company.\n“Insurance has a huge amount of data, and where data is there AI plays a big role. And if I look at the industry, be it underwriting, claims, contact centres, reaching out to consumers, Gen AI is going to play a big role. More than 95% of customer grievances are being handled by bots,” Singhel said.\nHowever, he emphasised the critical need for constant training to counter the tendency of AIs to \"hallucinate.\" \"You have to look at how to constantly improve and integrate it,\" Singhel said, calling the acceleration of AI's pace \"marvellous.\"\nWhile AI can easily manage the most common customer inquiries, such as policy clarification or delays, more complicated cases are still escalated to human agents, who are better equipped to handle them. Additionally, AI is currently assisting the company with basic underwriting and claims redressal.\n\"It has to move to the next level. I predict that in two years, you will see that it gets much, much better than what it is today,\" Singhel said.\nFDI and Market Expansion\nIn a recent development, Bajaj completed the acquisition of its partner Allianz's stake, making it a 100 percent Indian entity. This move follows the central government’s recent amendment to the insurance bill, which aims to enhance Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the sector.\nSinghel welcomed the FDI enhancement, pointing out the capital required for new entrants—a new insurance company needs approximately Rs 1,000 crore. He drew a comparison: while the US has over 6,000 insurance companies, India has only 17.\n\"Let's say 1,000 insurance companies enter India. You are talking about Rs 1,00,000 crores in investment,\" Singhel said. \"An insurance company generates at least 25,000 minimum jobs, so you are talking about a couple of crores of employment generation.\"\nSinghel also highlighted India's low insurance penetration, arguing that increased competition could solve the problem. Around 90 percent of Indian SMEs and MSMEs lack coverage, and a quarter of them go bankrupt following an untoward incident.\nHe suggested the upcoming Union Budget should address this by mandating compulsory insurance for both employees and MSMEs. \"Make it mandatory for all employers to cover all employees. Take care of SME, MSME, take care of sectors where we have an issue in terms of when something goes wrong, and the impact it has on the economy,\" Singhel urged.",

        "full_content": "Primary market issuances have cooled sharply, with January seeing only three initial public offerings so far, as sustained volatility in equity markets has prompted companies to remain on the sidelines.\nAfter a record year in 2025, when companies raised Rs 1.76 trillion through IPOs, fundraising activity in 2026 has remained muted so far. January till date, only three companies have launched public issues this year, collectively raising about Rs 4,765 crore. These include Bharat Coking Coal, Amagi Media Labs and Shadowfax Technologies.\nIndustry experts said while a few IPOs could enter the market in the coming months, many companies are likely to defer listing plans due to continued market uncertainty. Several firms that have already received regulatory approval may delay launches as volatile conditions make pricing difficult. Prolonged delays could also result in the expiry of financial statements included in draft prospectuses, requiring companies to update disclosures with the latest financials and further postponing fundraising plans.\nGaurav Bhandari, Chief Executive Officer of Monarch Networth Capital, said the slowdown in primary market activity is largely due to the meaningful correction witnessed across broader market and mid-cap indices. He said intense selling in these segments has created opportunities at lower valuations, prompting investors to deploy capital toward averaging existing holdings rather than subscribing to new issues, resulting in muted IPO activity.\nDespite the slowdown, the IPO pipeline for 2026 remains strong. More than 200 companies are preparing to tap the markets. Of these, 88 firms have already secured Securities and Exchange Board of India approval to raise over Rs 1 lakh crore, while others are awaiting clearance for an additional Rs 1.5 lakh crore. The pipeline includes several large names such as Hero Fincorp, Reliance Jio, Flipkart, PhonePe, HDFC Securities, OYO, Zepto and Boat.\nExperts said the pace of IPO launches seen over the past two years will depend heavily on overall market conditions and cannot be viewed in isolation. IPO activity is influenced not only by institutional participation but also by sentiment among high-net-worth individuals and retail investors, making secondary market stability a key factor for revival. They added that activity may remain subdued for a few months until broader markets stabilise, unless supported by major policy or budget-related announcements. Predicting an exact recovery timeline remains difficult, as market normalisation depends on multiple domestic and global factors.\nVinit Bolinjkar, Head of Research at Ventura, said progress on trade agreements between India and key global partners, including the United States, along with improved global economic stability, could act as meaningful catalysts for renewed momentum in the primary markets.\nSome experts also noted that the size of the IPO pipeline has contributed to caution, with concerns that multiple large offerings launched simultaneously could strain market liquidity. As a result, issuers are opting to stagger launches rather than rush multiple offerings at the same time. They added that muted post-listing performance of some recently listed companies has further cooled investor sentiment, although this phase does not indicate the end of the IPO cycle.\nUday Patil, Executive Director at PL Capital Markets, said companies had filed IPO documents based on pricing assumptions prevailing under earlier market conditions. With sentiment having changed, issuers may now need to revise valuation expectations. However, regulatory limits on reducing issue sizes have prompted several companies to defer launches instead of cutting prices sharply.\nPatil added that investors have become increasingly selective, preferring offerings at more reasonable valuations. He noted that some recent IPOs have been priced at discounts to earlier private placement valuations, reflecting current market conditions.",

        "full_content": "Swedish telecom gear maker Ericsson is doubling down on India, with CEO Börje Ekholm describing the country a “front-runner” and strategically prioritised market — not just for its scale but for its rapid technology adoption and portfolio relevance.\nIn an interview to Moneycontrol, Ekholm mentioned India’s world-leading data consumption and record-fast 5G rollout and said the surge in data usage will translate into fresh network investments over time, even if near-term spending moderates. He also spoke about India’s three-player market structure after the AGR relief for Vodafone Idea, the company’s India plans and the ongoing restructuring. Edited excerpts of the interview:\nHow do you view the government's move to offer relief to Vodafone Idea on the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) issue? Could it unlock new investments, given Vodafone Idea is a large customer for Ericsson?\nVodafone Idea should comment on its own situation but this development, in a way, solidifies India as a three-player market. That is still a good market structure.\nI am optimistic that, over time, this will lead to innovation on top of a very robust mobile network in India.\nDo you see a better outlook for the Indian telecom industry this year compared to last year?\nYes, I think this year we will see improving conditions in India for us.\nIndia contributes about 5 percent to Ericsson’s revenue. Could this go back to 7 percent as seen in the year-ago quarter?\nI do not want to guide specifically on that. However, you can hear me say that I am very optimistic about the development. We will see where it ends up.\nYou said in the post-earnings call that Ericsson expects to continue to reduce headcount. Will this impact operations in India where you have a large workforce?\nWe try to make ourselves efficient on a global basis. India has a highly skilled workforce and we have a very strong presence there. This allows us to use capabilities in India globally.\nExactly how this will pan out, I cannot say. Any efficiency measures we undertake globally will, of course, be considered across markets but India is a very material and strategic asset for the company.\nAlso, India has a slightly different voluntary attrition pattern compared to other countries, which in a way resolves redundancy situations relatively quickly.\nHow important is India for Ericsson today?\nIndia is today a front-runner market for us. It is a strategically prioritised market. Of course, you can look at it from a size point of view but it is equally important from an adaptability and front-runner portfolio perspective.\nIndia has one of the highest data consumption levels per capita. I believe that comes from the ambition to digitalise India from the government, as well as the strong growth and prospects in the country. When you look at the need in networks, it comes from this expanding consumption. The growth we continue to see will, over time, lead to investment needs. It will fluctuate a bit — up and down quarter over quarter and year over year.\nWe had the fastest 5G build-out ever in India. When that was completed in 2023, it created massive capacity that usage is now growing into. So you may see a slightly slower market in the short term but in the longer term, I am equally optimistic that it will return to a much better investment climate.\nLast year, we discussed Ericsson’s investments in India, including manufacturing and partnerships. Can we expect more announcements this year?\nIt is all linked to business volume, of course. What we have done over the past few years — and what will continue — is that since India is a key market for us where we need a strong presence, we want to be part of the ecosystem in India.\nThat means investing in R&D, manufacturing and overall presence. Exactly when and how future investments will look, we will come back to but our commitment to being a strong partner in India’s digitalisation is very firm.\nAI has been a major theme globally and in telecom. Nvidia recently announced a billion-dollar deal with Nokia for AI RAN and data centre solutions. Is Ericsson pursuing similar collaborations? Could there be strategic changes this year?\nOur strategy has been firm for quite some time. We collaborate with all hardware providers. We believe AI will be critical in RAN, which is why we are part of the AI RAN consortium.\nWe already use AI in our networks — for energy efficiency, spectrum efficiency, and overall network operations. AI is already an integral part of our networks.\nA billion dollars is a significant investment but we spend about $5 billion annually on R&D. Consider the scale. Our strategy is to separate hardware and software, making our solutions hardware-independent.\nThe reason is to give customers flexibility to choose the most competitive hardware layer at any point in time. It could be GPUs or x86 — we do not know yet. We have chosen a slightly different strategic approach.\nGiven the ongoing geopolitical tensions, tariffs and concerns around critical minerals, how is Ericsson navigating supply-chain challenges?\nWe may have taken a slightly different approach than many others. Instead of trying to predict an uncertain world, we focus on being as flexible as possible.\nWe have designed our supply chain to be flexible across different regions, including India. The same applies to R&D. While we cannot predict global developments, we can ensure flexibility to manage different situations. So far, the impact of tariffs on us has been very limited.",

That is still a good market structure. I am optimistic that, over time, this will lead to innovation on top of a very robust mobile network in India,” Ekholm told Moneycontrol in an interview.\nThe government in December froze Vodafone Idea’s adjusted gross revenue dues at Rs 87,695 crore, while approving a staggered repayment plan allowing the debt-laden telco to clear the liabilities between FY32 and FY41.\nSignalling a stronger year ahead, Ekholm said operating conditions in India are set to improve, even as the industry transitions beyond the peak of its record 5G rollout cycle. “I think this year we will see improving conditions in India for us,” he said.\nIndia accounted for 5 percent of Ericsson’s global revenue in the October–December quarter. Asked whether this could scale up to 7 percent, as in 2024, on the back of higher expected capex by telcos, he said, “I am very optimistic about the (AGR) development. We will see where it ends up.”\nIndia a strategic asset\nEricsson is expected to continue with lay-offs as part of its cost-cutting and restructuring effort, having reduced headcount by 5,000 over the past year.

But our commitment to being a strong partner in India’s digitalisation is very firm,” he said.\nEricsson operates major R&D centres in Chennai, Bengaluru and Gurugram across packet core, transport, OSS/BSS, cloud and AI, with around 2,300 professionals in India. Recently, it expanded into ASIC development in Bengaluru, adding over 150 roles and deepening its footprint in the semiconductor ecosystem.\nThe company is also setting up a new RAN Software R&D unit in Bengaluru to develop 5G and 5G Advanced features for its 5G baseband, in close collaboration with global RAN teams.\nIndia is a front-runner market for the Swedish telecom gear maker, he said, adding that it is a strategically prioritised market. “You can look at it from a size point of view, but it is equally important from an adaptability and front-runner portfolio perspective.

        "full_content": "The proposed free trade agreement (FTA) between India and the European Union (EU) may not lead to immediate price reductions for most luxury cars sold in the country, with manufacturers saying the impact on consumer pricing is likely to be limited in the near term. Industry executives and analysts said while certain niche, fully imported models could benefit over time, the bulk of the luxury car market is unlikely to see a material change.\nAfter nearly a decade of negotiations, India and the EU are expected to announce the conclusion of the proposed trade deal on January 27.\nMore than 90 percent of luxury vehicles sold in India — around 51,000–52,000 units annually — are assembled locally. Brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover and Audi operate assembly facilities in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, producing vehicles that often retail above Rs 1 crore. These models are assembled from completely knocked down (CKD) kits imported from overseas manufacturing hubs.\nCKD kits attract an import duty of 15 percent along with a 1.5 percent social welfare surcharge, taking the total to 16.5 percent. In contrast, completely built units (CBUs) face substantially higher duties of 70 percent or 110 percent, depending on vehicle value. Under the proposed FTA, duties on fully imported vehicles could be reduced to around 40 percent initially, with a phased reduction to 10 percent over time.\nGiven that locally assembled luxury vehicles already attract comparatively lower duties, the scope for meaningful reductions in the prices of these models remains limited. Responding to a query from Moneycontrol, Santosh Iyer, managing director and CEO of Mercedes-Benz India, said the agreement was unlikely to materially influence pricing. With over 90 percent of Mercedes-Benz India’s sales coming from locally assembled models and only about 5 percent from EU CBUs, the company does not anticipate any near-term price relief stemming from the FTA, he said.\nFollow our live blog for the latest on India-EU FTA\nMercedes-Benz assembles its vehicles at its Chakan plant near Pune, importing kits primarily from Germany. The company recently began local production of the Mercedes-Maybach GLS — its first such move outside the US — which resulted in a price reduction of about Rs 42 lakh, or roughly 13 percent, compared to the imported version, underscoring the impact of localisation rather than trade concessions.\nBMW, the country’s second-largest luxury carmaker, follows a similar approach, with nearly nine of ten models assembled locally. While the company does not expect immediate price changes to its current lineup, it views the proposed FTA as a longer-term opportunity. BMW Group India president and CEO Hardeep Singh Brar said lower duties on CBUs could help broaden the brand’s portfolio by enabling the introduction of globally popular models and allowing manufacturers to test demand before committing to deeper localisation.\nAlso read: FTA with EU could give an initial $5 billion boost to Indian exports\nJaguar Land Rover also signalled that trade agreements are unlikely to translate into immediate price changes for its India-assembled models. The company assembles several Range Rover and Discovery models at its Pune facility, with a larger plant near Chennai expected to get operational soon. Even as the proposed Indo-UK FTA awaits implementation, the company has indicated that customers should not expect near-term pricing benefits.\nIndustry observers said the biggest beneficiaries of lower import duties could be niche supercar manufacturers such as Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini and Porsche, all of which import fully built vehicles into India. Similarly, UK-manufactured ultra-luxury brands such as Rolls-Royce and Bentley could see some benefit under a future Indo-UK trade agreement.\nThat said, analysts caution that currency movements may offset a significant portion of any duty-related gains. Luxury carmakers implemented multiple price hikes in 2025 and again in early 2026, largely due to exchange-rate pressures. “The rupee depreciated by nearly 19 percent against the euro in 2025 alone, which could dilute much of the benefit from lower import duties on fully built cars in the next couple of years,” a market expert said.\nWhile trade agreements may gradually reshape the structure of luxury car imports into India, meaningful price relief for most premium car buyers is likely to remain a longer-term prospect rather than an immediate outcome.",

        "full_content": "On January 17, India’s civil aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), made public the findings of a four-member inquiry committee constituted to investigate the unprecedented operational disruption faced by IndiGo in early December.\nThe committee’s conclusions were unequivocal. The crisis, it said, was not triggered by a single event, but by a combination of over-optimisation of operations, inadequate regulatory preparedness, deficiencies in system software support, and, most critically, shortcomings in IndiGo’s management structure and operational control.\nAt the heart of these findings was IndiGo’s Operations Control Centre (OCC), a function widely regarded as the nerve centre of any airline. The DGCA’s subsequent regulatory action squarely focused on the OCC and its leadership—specifically Jason Herter, Senior Vice President in charge of the OCC.\n'Unprecedented operational breakdown'\nBetween December 3 and December 5, IndiGo cancelled more than 2,500 flights and delayed over 1,850, leaving upwards of 300,000 passengers stranded across airports in the country. The scale of the disruption also triggered a cascading impact on the operations of other airlines, placing stress on airport infrastructure, ground handling resources and air traffic management systems.\nIn response, the DGCA constituted the inquiry committee on December 6 to undertake a review the circumstances that led to what it said was an unprecedented operational breakdown.\nAccording to the committee report, IndiGo’s management failed to adequately identify planning deficiencies, maintain sufficient operational buffers and effectively implement the revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) provisions. These failures, the report said, directly resulted in widespread delays and large-scale cancellations.\nThe inquiry also highlighted an overriding focus on maximising utilisation of crew, aircraft and network resources. Crew rosters were designed to stretch duty periods to their limits, with increased dependence on dead-heading, tail swaps, extended duty patterns and minimal recovery margins. While such measures can improve efficiency under stable conditions, the committee noted that they significantly reduced roster buffers and compromised operational resilience when disruptions occurred. In effect, IndiGo’s operating model left little room for error.\nFollowing the inquiry, the DGCA ordered IndiGo to reduce its daily flight operations by 10 percent — amounting to a cut of just over 200 flights from its usual schedule of 2,050–2,100 services a day. The regulator also directed the airline to compensate affected passengers as per applicable regulations and imposed a financial penalty of Rs 22.2 crore.\nLeadership under fire\nHowever, the most stringent action was taken against IndiGo’s top operational leadership. The DGCA ordered the removal of Jason Herter, senior vice president (Operations Control Centre), from current operational responsibilities and barred him from holding any accountable position. The regulator cited failures in systemic planning and the timely implementation of revised FDTL provisions.\nThe OCC is often described as an airline’s nerve centre. It exercises operational control over flights and is responsible for the real-time coordination of aircraft, crew, flight dispatch and network decisions. The OCC continuously monitors weather patterns, airspace restrictions, aircraft technical status, crew duty limitations and airport conditions.\nWhen disruptions arise—whether due to bad weather, technical snags, airspace closures or crew shortages—the OCC decides whether flights should operate, be delayed, diverted or cancelled. It also oversees route planning, fuel requirements, alternate airports and compliance with regulatory limits.\nCrucially, the OCC ensures that flight crews are properly qualified, legally rested and available at the right place and time. Any misjudgement in this complex balancing act can rapidly snowball into widespread disruption, particularly for a high-frequency, tightly scheduled airline such as IndiGo.\nHerter has served as IndiGo’s Senior Vice President (OCC) since July 2023 and is among the airline’s senior leadership. A former Group Head of the Network Management Centre at AirAsia, he was set to complete a decade with IndiGo in September 2026.\nHis responsibilities include oversight of the OCC, crew resources and operations management systems. This spans crew manpower planning, roster and training planning, crew scheduling, network management and flight dispatch—functions that sit at the core of day-to-day airline operations.\nMore than a week after the DGCA order was issued, IndiGo is yet to formally comply with the directive to remove Herter from operational responsibilities. Responding to queries, IndiGo chief executive officer Pieter Elbers said the airline had received the order and was evaluating it.\n“The board and the management of IndiGo are committed to take full cognizance of these orders and will in a timely manner take the appropriate measures,” Elbers said.\nHe added that an in-depth review of the robustness of IndiGo’s internal processes is underway and that the airline is engaging with the regulator. A key focus, he said, is ensuring continuity and stability of operations as the revised FDTL norms are lifted on February 11.\nThe December disruption has underscored a fundamental truth of airline operations: efficiency without adequate buffers can quickly turn into fragility. For an airline of IndiGo’s scale, the OCC is not merely a back-office function, but the command centre that safeguards safety, compliance and operational continuity.\nAs the DGCA’s findings suggest, failures at the OCC level can have consequences that extend far beyond a single airline—affecting passengers, airports and the wider aviation ecosystem.",

It is the second generation of an AI chip called Maia that Microsoft introduced in 2023.\nThe Maia 200 comes as major cloud computing firms such as Microsoft, Alphabet's Google and Amazon.com's Amazon Web Services - some of Nvidia's biggest customers - are producing their own chips that increasingly compete with Nvidia.\nGoogle, in particular, has garnered interest from major Nvidia customers such as Meta Platforms, which is working closely with Google to close one of the biggest software gaps between Google and Nvidia's AI chip offerings.\nFor its part, Microsoft said that along with the new Maia chip, it will be offering a package of software tools to program it. That includes Triton, an open-source software tool with major contributions from ChatGPT creator OpenAI that takes on the same tasks as Cuda, the Nvidia software that many Wall Street analysts say is Nvidia's biggest competitive advantage.\nLike Nvidia's forthcoming flagship \"Vera Rubin\" chips introduced earlier this month, Microsoft's Maia 200 is made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co using 3-nanometer chipmaking technology and will use high-bandwidth memory chips, albeit an older and slower generation than Nvidia's forthcoming chips.\nBut Microsoft has also taken a page from the playbook of some of Nvidia's rising competitors by packing the Maia 200 chip with a significant amount of what is known as SRAM, a type of memory that can provide speed advantages for chatbots and other AI systems when they field requests from a large number of users.\nCerebras Systems, which recently inked a $10 billion deal with OpenAI to supply computing power, leans heavily on that technology, as does Groq, the startup that Nvidia licensed technology from in a reported $20 billion deal.",

        "full_content": "PVR INOX’s decision to exit gourmet popcorn brand 4700BC will not dent its food and beverage business, and will, in fact, improve its earnings profile, the multiplex chain said on Monday.\nThe company announced on January 26 that it has divested its stake in Zea Maize, the owner of 4700BC, selling the brand to FMCG major Marico for Rs 226.8 crore. PVR INOX had acquired a 70 percent stake in the company in 2015 for around Rs 5 crore.\nPopcorn and profit\n“The sale of 4700BC will have no impact on our food and beverage revenue. When we sell this business, it removes a loss-making subsidiary and is therefore accretive to our earnings,” said Gaurav Sharma, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of PVR INOX told Moneycontrol. “It also presented a timely monetisation opportunity for a non-core asset to unlock shareholder value.”\nSharma said the popcorn brand contributed about Rs 100 crore in annual revenue, accounting for less than one percent of PVR INOX’s total F&B sales. In contrast, 4700BC reported an EBITDA loss of nearly Rs 14 crore in FY25 and a total loss of about Rs 16 crore.\nAlso read: Inside PVR Inox’s popcorn strategy: Driving F&B spends amid weak box office in FY25\n“The big benefit is that this business was loss-making. By exiting, we remove that drag on earnings,” he said, adding that the divestment will have “zero impact” on PVR INOX’s in-cinema and home delivery operations.\nMoviegoers will continue to see 4700BC popcorn at PVR INOX theatres, as the brand will remain available as a third-party offering.\nIn terms of returns, Sharma said the company had invested a total of Rs 94.6 crore as equity in 4700BC over time, with the bulk of the capital infused post-Covid as the brand expanded onto quick-commerce platforms.\n“This transaction delivers a very healthy return. We will receive Rs 226.8 crore in cash, translating into an internal rate of return of around 24.5 percent on our total equity investment,” he said.\nThe immediate cash infusion of Rs 227 crore used to deleverage reduces net debt by around 25 percent, accelerating the goal of near-zero debt by FY27, noted Karan Taurani, Executive Vice President at Elara Capital.\nThe company will be able to save Rs 18-20 crore in annual interest cost, as it currently has a net debt of Rs 600 crore.\nAlso read: PVR INOX exits gourmet popcorn brand 4700BC for Rs 226.8 crore, stake sold to Marico\nUse of funds\nThe proceeds will be deployed across three priority areas: reducing debt, strengthening the balance sheet, and funding the core cinema business.\n“We have been pivoting towards a more asset-light model with more franchise-led expansion. But there are still large opportunities in markets where multiplex penetration is low,” Sharma said. “So, the use of proceeds will be a combination of deleveraging and funding growth.”\nOn the F&B front, PVR INOX plans to continue building its in-house brands. The company currently has around 10 food and beverage brands, including Dogfather, its hotdog concept.\n“Our focus is on building brands in fast-growing categories where there are no strong players today,” Sharma said. “4700BC is more of an FMCG and QSR-style business.”\nHe added that 4700BC has built a strong multi-channel presence across digital commerce, modern retail and institutional channels, but its next phase of growth requires deeper FMCG capabilities.\n“We realised that at this stage, the brand is better supported by a larger FMCG platform like Marico, which brings wider distribution, faster product expansion and more capital,” Sharma said.",

        "full_content": "As India looks to sustain deal momentum amid global uncertainty, tax clarity has become as critical as tax rates. For the M&A ecosystem, Budget 2026 comes at a time when deal structuring is increasingly shaped by tax certainty, dispute risk and execution timelines. The Budget therefore presents an opportunity to address issues that continue to influence deal activity.\nClarity after the Tiger Global judgement\nAs the taxpayers and advisors prepare for the landscape post the Supreme Court’s Tiger Global judgement, it is critical that the government provides clarity particularly on the fate of past cases and concluded transactions. Guidance on the applicability of the General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR), especially for investments made before 1 April 2017 which were grandfathered, would help reduce uncertainty and potential litigation.\nTax neutrality for fast-track demergers\nSection 233 of the Companies Act was introduced to expedite demergers and to make intra-group and smaller restructurings faster. Such demergers though fast tracked still require filings with the regulator and compliances to be undertaken. As per the government, fast track demergers are not tax neutral since they are not court-monitored and thus could potentially result in tax avoidance. In the absence of tax neutrality of demergers, the fast-track option becomes commercially meaningless. Apprehensions of the revenue could be addressed through clear valuation norms, further, GAAR could help address any avoidance arrangements. That would align tax policy with the stated ease-of-doing-business intent.\nService sector mergers\nGiven the increased prominence of the service sector in India growth story, it would be pertinent to extend the benefit of carry forward of losses in the case of mergers of service sectors and should not be restricted to manufacturing/hotels/industrial undertakings.\nTax certainty for global capability centres (GCC) in India - supporting a strategic growth engine\nGCCs in India have been rapidly growing with many multinationals setting their GCCs in India due to availability of skilled labour at reduced costs, ease of language, political stability and business friendly environment. With the growth of GCCs, host of tax aspects become relevant including permanent establishment (PE) concerns. It would be helpful if the government comes out with some safe harbours from PE rigours especially on cross-border secondments and remuneration for the GCCs including introduction of concessional tax regimes for GGCs, data centres, etc.\nTax neutrality for cross-border mergers and restructurings\nIndian businesses are increasingly global in their footprint and investor base. Yet outbound mergers, where an Indian company merges into an overseas company, often face immediate tax implications even when there is no monetisation. One of the long-standing demands of the tax community has been for the government to provide neutrality on outbound mergers or business combinations. While there are provisions providing exemption to inbound mergers, lack of clarity on outbound mergers has often caused hinderances in Indian companies going global.\nAlso, in the case of foreign mergers, particularly with wholly owned subsidiaries, tax neutrality is uncertain since the condition of issuing shares to oneself, required for tax neutrality, is practically impossible to fulfil. This condition is already relaxed in the case of domestic mergers. A similar relaxation should be extended to foreign mergers, along with a shareholder-level exemption where such mergers indirectly result in the transfer of Indian share.\nOther clarifications\nTaxpayers would also expect clarifications on safe harbours for buying out listed companies through the off-market process from the trigger of Section 56(2)(x) of the Income-tax Act, 1961, since at occasions, it can be difficult to match the market price, especially where there is gap between signing and closing of the transaction. In addition, rationalising the holding period for slump sales, currently set at 36 months, as against 12 or 24 months for most of the asset classes, could be a welcome step. Further, clarity on the timing of taxation of contingent consideration, by taxing such amounts as capital gains only upon actual crystallisation rather than upfront at closing, would better align taxation with the commercial realities of milestone-based M&A transactions.\nWith Budget 2026 around the corner, targeted interventions in these areas could go a long way in improving business sentiment, reducing disputes and enabling deal activity that supports economic growth.\n(Vinita Krishnan is Executive Director and Bharat Jain, Principal Associate at Khaitan & Co.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "India's top multiplex chain PVR INOX that is often called as one of the biggest food brands as well has exited from gourmet popcorn brand 4700BC owned by Zea Maize.\nThe theatre company has sold its stake in Zea Maize to Marico for Rs Rs 226.8 crore.\nPVR INOX had acquired a 70 percent stake in Zea Maize for around Rs 5 crore in 2015.\nZea Maize, which owns the premium popcorn and snacks brand ‘4700BC’ recorded 35 percent revenue growth, crossing Rs 102 crore in sales in FY25, up from Rs 75.8 crore a year ago.\nThe brand, which has evolved from gourmet popcorn to over 10 categories, is set to enter its next phase of growth, fueled by wider distribution reach, entry into general trade and modern retail, and expansion into complementary snacking segments.\nIndia’s snacking market, valued at Rs 45,000 crore in FY23, is projected to nearly double to Rs 85,000 crore by FY30, growing at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 9 percent. The premium snacking category is expected to grow at 20 percent CAGR, reaching Rs 24,000 crore by FY30. 4700BC aims to have a significant share in this space while diversifying into more snacking categories.\nPVR Inox invested Rs 44.7 crore in Zea Maize in FY25 to increase production capacity for existing products, increase presence across retail outlets, hire senior talent across leadership roles in sales, operations and marketing.\n“We recognised the potential in 4700BC at a very early stage and supported the brand through its formative years. From a niche gourmet popcorn offering, it has grown into a nationally recognised premium snacking brand. As it looks to scale further and broaden its ambition, the brand is well positioned under the stewardship of a scaled FMCG leader like Marico. For PVR INOX, this transaction represents a natural culmination of our strategic role and enables us to monetise a non-core asset,” said Ajay Bijli, Managing Director, PVR INOX.\nSaugata Gupta, MD and CEO, Marico Limited said, “The investment in 4700BC aligns well with Marico’s ambition to participate in fast-growing food categories through distinctive, future-ready brands. We see immense potential in 4700BC as a premium snacking brand with deep consumer connect and proven execution. Together, we will tap the opportunity to leverage our existing scale in foods to broaden the brand’s presence across channels, while staying true to its consumer-first ethos and harnessing its top-notch innovation capabilities.”",

The agreement is expected to pave the way for setting up a Final Assembly Line (FAL) in India for Embraer’s civilian aircraft, sources said.\nEmbraer manufactures commercial jets with seating capacity of up to 150 passengers. The proposed FAL will mark Adani Group’s entry into aircraft manufacturing, expanding its footprint in India’s rapidly growing aviation ecosystem.\nOne of the sources said that, over time, Adani Group is also likely to begin manufacturing aircraft components once the assembly line becomes operational.\nIn a joint media invitation issued by the two companies for a briefing in the national capital on January 27, they said that “a historic development in India's commercial aviation ‘Make in India’ journey will be announced.”\nEmbraer has been stepping up its focus on the Indian market to tap into long-term growth opportunities. In October 2025, the Brazilian aircraft maker opened a new office in New Delhi.\nThe proposed venture with Adani Group is expected to give Embraer a significant boost in India’s civil aviation space, where it aims to offer cost-competitive regional jets.\nEmbraer’s E-Jets began operating in India in 2005, and the company currently has nearly 50 aircraft in the country. These serve the Indian Air Force, government agencies, business jet operators and regional airline Star Air.\nAccording to Embraer, the Indian aviation market is expected to require at least 500 aircraft in the 80–146 seat segment over the next 20 years. The company highlighted this projection in a release issued on January 21.\nIn the defence segment, Embraer Defense & Security had, in 2024, signed an MoU with Mahindra Defence Systems to explore a joint bid for the Indian Air Force’s Medium Transport Aircraft (MTA) programme using the C-390 Millennium platform.\nEmbraer is also looking to strengthen its presence across multiple aviation segments in India, including commercial aviation, defence, business jets, services and support, as well as urban air mobility.\nMeanwhile, the government is working on measures to boost civilian aerospace manufacturing and maintenance activities in the country. In November 2025, French aerospace major Safran announced that its maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility for LEAP engines in India would become operational this year.",

What we are seeing is customers, against that uncertainty, make decisions which prompt an investment, and that's what we're looking to. That's what we are intersecting with, and that's what's inspiring the confidence that we've got about Q4 and the next fiscal year.\" He was responding to a query on the growth outlook in the midst of tariff wars and geopolitical uncertainty.\nFor FY26, he said,\"We will look to drive sequential double-digit growth (from) Q3 to Q4 and then we expect double digit growth organically next year.\" In the third quarter ended December 31, 2025 the company had posted a consolidated revenue from operations at Rs 1,365.73 crore as against Rs 1,317.38 crore in the year-ago period.\nReferring to the company's 75 million euros (over Rs 775 crore) acquisition of Germany-based ES-Tech GmbH and its subsidiaries last year, Harris said,\"…that will represent about USD 40 million of additional business for us and we expect that business to grow…In addition to the organic double-digit growth, that business will be included in our numbers.\"\nNoting that the company expects volume to translate into significant margin improvement, he said,\"We are looking at a very good year next year, both top line and and bottom line.\" When asked about possible hiring to meet growth expectations, Harris said.\n\"As we move into the year (next fiscal), we don't need any more resources, but as we move through the year and as the anticipated growth continues, then we will need to start to add headcount.\"\nDespite the company investing very heavily in AI, he said,\"We do not need to do any retrenchments in a material way, and we will drive incremental growth next year but it will be in a way that will complement the investments we are making in AI and digital.\" The company has been investing very heavily and reskilling its teams to ensure that the capability matches the demand in the market, Harris said, adding \"we have been relatively lean in terms of things like overhead and bench\".\nOn the expectations from the upcoming Union Budget, he said the government has been very supportive of the manufacturing sector and specifically the automotive industry and the company would like to see the government continue the support they provided for those sectors.\n\"It is really accelerating, not just the size of the manufacturing sector, and specifically the automotive sector, but also the maturity of the industries here in India,\" Harris noted.",

        "full_content": "Tata Motors managing director and CEO Girish Wagh has said the strong uptick in demand for trucks and buses has prompted a strategic revaluation of the company’s manufacturing capacity.\nIn an interview to Moneycontrol, he said the company is looking at squeezing out incremental volumes from its existing plants through process optimisation and “de-bottlenecking” to keep up with robust demand. Edited excerpts of the interview:\nOn January 20 you launched a large set of new products in one go. What segment will they cater to?\nWe launched 17 vehicles in three-four themes. Never have we done this kind of a wide launch before. In the multi-axle segment, we have four tonnage points; 28, 35, 42 and 48 tonne. We have studied the regulations and the kind of maximum loads is allowed per axle, and the how much the road can bear and based on the allowed framework, they have redesigned the suspension of a tandem axle.\nWhat is a tandem axle?\nA tandem axle is a combination of two axles in the rear, which distributes the load between the two more evenly and therefore, stay within the road limit. Therefore, there is an increase in the payload by around 1.8 tonne. Likewise, a 28 tonne vehicle will become a 30 tonne vehicle and so on.\nHow were they different previously?\nNot more than six years back, they increased the axle load regulation, where the maximum GVW (gross vehicle weight) of a 5-axle truck used to be 37 tonne and 3718 was the highest selling vehicle. Through this innovation, a four-axle truck will have 37 tonne capacity.\nWhat are the other launches you have planned?\nIn ILMCV (intermediate, light and medium) segment, we are launching the Azura brand. We are also launching a range of electric trucks in the 9, 12, 19 28, 55 tonne configuration. These trucks will come with our new intelligent, modular, EV architecture, which consists of modular battery packs and in-house battery management system and in-house developed e-axles.\nHow much has Tata Motors invested in the development of these new products?\nWe have been saying that we will stay within 2-4 percent of the revenue as the capex. More than half of this is R&D. A good part of the capex has been routed towards electrification, connectivity and autonomous. Its not just the vehicle architecture that has been improved, it’s the powertrain too which can take us right up to 2040 and the new-gen battery electric architecture which can also take us beyond that.\nWith these new launches and demand uptick, are you looking at capacity creation?\nWe are not looking at greenfield expansion because we have sufficient space among all our plant. But with some of the migrations that has happened within a segment to a different model, there are specific areas where we are revisiting our capacity and capex requirement. During this year, we have increased the capacity of bus-body building. We are doing it in a selective manner and this is going to be a de-bottlenecking exercise rather than full-fledged capacity greenfield creation.\nWhat is the capacity utilisation rate?\nOur Jamshedpur and Lucknow plants' capacity utilisation are upwards of 80-85 percent. Depending on the vehicle, our Pantnagar plant will be around 50-60 percent. At Dharwad, again depending on the vehicle, could be operating at 60-70 percent utilisation and Pune could be at 60-85 percent.\nWhat has been the jump due to the GST cut?\nGoing by the Vahan data, Q3 over Q2 (FY26) ,the industry has grown by 25.8 percent and our volumes grew by 29.4 percent. Post-GST there are certainly some segments that have started to do well. Car carriers and e-commerce have been doing very well. Steel, cement have done well. Tipper and mining trucks have gone up well. ILCV and heavy have seen very good growth.",

        "full_content": "Sun Pharma on Thursday said it has received approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to manufacture and market a generic version of semaglutide injection for chronic weight management in adults.\nThe drug will be launched under the brand name Noveltreat after the expiry of the semaglutide patent in India, the company said in a press statement to exchanges, signalling the entry of a domestic player into a category currently dominated by high-priced innovator products.\nSemaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist used for weight management alongside a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. Sun Pharma said the approval followed a Phase III clinical trial conducted in India, addressing a key regulatory requirement for local evidence.\nNoveltreat will be available in five dose strengths, 0.25 mg/0.5 mL, 0.5 mg/0.5 mL, 1 mg/0.5 mL, 1.7 mg/0.75 mL and 2.4 mg/0.75 mL, with a recommended maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly. The drug will be administered through a prefilled pen designed for self-use.\nThe approval positions Sun Pharma to compete in India’s fast-growing obesity and metabolic disease market once patent barriers fall, the company said.\nKirti Ganorkar, managing director of Sun Pharma, said the company aims to expand access to GLP-1 therapies after patent expiry, adding that Noveltreat meets global quality standards and is backed by Indian clinical data on safety and efficacy.\nMedical experts cautioned that GLP-1 therapies are not standalone solutions. Dr Unnikrishnan A G, chief endocrinologist and CEO of Chellaram Diabetes Institute, said such drugs should be used under medical supervision and combined with lifestyle interventions.\nThis is Sun Pharma’s second regulatory clearance for semaglutide in recent months. In December 2025, the company received DCGI approval to manufacture and market semaglutide for adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. That product will be sold under the brand Sematrinity, also post-patent expiry.",

        "full_content": "India’s largest airline IndiGo will hand back airport slots it is no longer utilising, as it undertakes a course correction following regulatory action triggered by large-scale operational disruptions last month.\nThe move comes after the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) ordered IndiGo to cut its flight schedule by 10% in December, following an unprecedented breakdown in operations that left more than 300,000 passengers stranded and resulted in over 4,500 flight cancellations.\nSpeaking to analysts, IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers said airlines have a responsibility to return slots they are unable to operate. “If airlines are operating certain slots, then it is the duty of the airline to hand back unutilized slots arising out of non-utilization or planned consolidations,” he said.\nElbers added that the airline has clarity on its operational plan for the near term. “We know what our plan is for the next two months. We are handing these slots back. Their reallocation though is the prerogative of the airports and that will be part of further evaluation going forward,” he said.\nIndiGo currently operates around 2,200 domestic and international flights daily. The airline has assured the regulator that it will maintain operational stability without flight cancellations after February 10, when a temporary exemption from the revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms expires.\nWhile Elbers declined to disclose the exact number of pilots employed by IndiGo, industry estimates suggest the airline has more than 2,400 Airbus captains against a requirement of around 2,280.\nOn January 17, the DGCA released key findings of a four-member inquiry committee set up to examine the causes behind IndiGo’s December disruptions. The committee concluded that the primary reasons were over-optimisation of operations, inadequate regulatory preparedness, deficiencies in system software support, and shortcomings in management structure and operational control.\nThe report said IndiGo’s management failed to identify planning deficiencies, maintain sufficient operational buffers, and effectively implement the revised FDTL provisions. These failures led to widespread delays and cancellations, severely inconveniencing passengers.\nFollowing the findings, the DGCA directed IndiGo to relieve Senior Vice President (Operations Control Centre) Jason Herter of his current operational responsibilities and barred him from holding any accountable position, citing failures in systemic planning and timely implementation of FDTL norms.\nResponding to the regulator’s orders, Elbers said to Moneycontrol the airline was reviewing them. “We are in receipt of the orders of the DGCA and they are being evaluated. The board and the management of IndiGo are committed to take full cognizance of these orders and will in a timely manner take the appropriate measures,” he said.\nHe added that the airline has initiated a broader internal review. “An in-depth review of the robustness of internal processes is on the way and we are engaging with the DGCA on the orders when it comes to ensuring a smooth transition and ensuring continuity and stability of the operations itself,” Elbers said.",

        "full_content": "Vietnamese electric vehicle maker VinFast is preparing a major expansion of its India operations, with plans to enter ride-hailing services, electric two-wheelers, buses and EV charging infrastructure in the second half of 2026, a senior company executive said.\nThe company, which showcased its electric cars in India in 2025 and began commercial sales in the latter half of the year, is now moving into the next phase of growth alongside its parent, Vin Group.\n“We have invested $500 million for our car project and another $500 million we are investing in the two-wheeler and bus project, both of which will come in the second half,”  VinFast India CEO Tapan Kumar Ghosh told Moneycontrol.\nAs part of its broader mobility push, VinFast group company Green and Smart Mobility (GSM) will launch an electric vehicle ride-hailing service in India. GSM operates exclusively with VinFast cars and scooters and will take on incumbents Ola and Uber.\n“The ride-hailing business will be independent from VinFast India operations. It will be buying the cars from us and operate them as fleet,” Ghosh said.\nVinFast also plans to launch three new electric vehicle models this year, adding to its existing VF6 and VF7 lineup. One of the upcoming models will be a seven-seater multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) aimed primarily at the taxi and fleet segment. At least one of the remaining models will be a compact SUV positioned against rivals such as the Tata Nexon EV.\n“There is a huge segment below the VF6 and we have to be present there,” Ghosh said. Currently, the VF6 is VinFast’s entry-level offering in India. It is priced at Rs 17.29 lakh.\nVinFast sold 826 cars in India in 2025 after starting sales in September but the company has not disclosed its sales targets for 2026. Its completely knocked-down (CKD) assembly plant in Tamil Nadu has an annual capacity of 50,000 vehicles, which can be scaled up to 150,000 units. The facility assembles imported kits from Vietnam, with about 10 percent localisation at present.\nIn the medium to long term, VinFast aims to significantly increase localisation levels to reduce exposure to uncertainties around battery and component supply. The company is also expanding its retail footprint, planning to increase dealerships from 35 in 2025 to 70 in 2026. Sales and dealership networks for two-wheelers and buses will operate separately from the passenger car business.",

The GI talks aim to help traditional European farming products sell more in India by addressing imitation and unfair competition.\nEU calls deal ‘historic’\nCommenting on the agri-food chapter of the agreement, Christophe Hansen, European Commissioner for Agriculture and Food, said: “Thanks to this historic trade agreement, the markets of nearly 2 billion people are joined together. Our agri-food exports to India have so far been held back by extremely high tariffs. Under this agreement European wines, spirits, beers, olive oil, confectionary, and other products will enjoy preferential access to the rapidly growing Indian market.”\nHe added that the agreement balances new market access with protections for sensitive sectors:\n“Front and centre to these negotiations, was maximizing new opportunities for our unmatched European products, while protecting European farmers. That is why the tariffs on the most sensitive products such as beef, sugar, ethanol, rice and poultry will remain in place. As in any trade agreement, our high food safety standards are fully maintained. The safety of EU consumers is non-negotiable,\" Hansen said.",

        "needs_deep_fetch": true,
        "full_content": "As India approaches the Union Budget 2026, the scale of the MSME sector is no longer a matter of debate. As of September 2025, over 6.8 crore MSMEs are registered on the Udyam Registration Portal and the Udyam Assist Platform, together employing nearly 30 crore people. MSMEs today are not peripheral contributors to the economy. They sit at its operational core.\nWhat has changed just as significantly is how these businesses function. Formalisation has accelerated, digital adoption has deepened, and financial connectivity has improved. Nearly three-quarters of MSME transactions are now digital. The growth of UPI has played a central role in this transition, with monthly transactions crossing 20 billion for the first time in August 2025. These are not abstract indicators. They reflect a fundamental shift in how small businesses manage cash flows, make payments, and interact with the financial system.\nThis progress has created a strong foundation for growth. It has also made the remaining constraints more visible. For many MSMEs, the challenge today is not access to markets or willingness to formalise. It is whether the systems around credit, compliance, and policy delivery are equipped to support scale.\nFrom the MSME sector perspective, four priorities stand out for the Union Budget 2026.\nModernise credit guarantee frameworks\nCredit guarantees have been among the most effective tools for expanding collateral-free lending to MSMEs. By sharing risk with lenders, they have unlocked credit at a scale traditional asset-backed models could not achieve.\nAs MSMEs become more data-rich and digitally visible, these frameworks must evolve. Expanding coverage limits, simplifying claim settlement processes, and extending eligibility to a wider set of growth-stage enterprises can materially improve lender confidence and reduce borrowing costs.\nThe next phase of MSME credit growth will be driven by cashflow-based lending rather than static balance-sheet assessments. Credit guarantees should align with this shift. When guarantees support real business performance, they move from being a safety mechanism to becoming an active enabler of scale. A dedicated Budget allocation to expand the MSME credit guarantee corpus, focused on cashflow-based models, would be a powerful catalyst for the next growth cycle.\nReduce compliance friction\nFormalisation has delivered clear benefits, but it has also increased the compliance burden on smaller businesses. For many micro and small enterprises, managing GST filings, audits, and reporting requirements still demands disproportionate time and effort, often falling directly on the entrepreneur.\nSimplifying compliance thresholds, rationalising reporting requirements, and reducing duplication across processes would immediately improve productivity. Continued progress toward unified digital compliance can ease operational strain without compromising transparency.\nEase of compliance is as critical as ease of credit. Regulation that is proportionate to scale encourages businesses to remain formal and grow within the system. Predictable compliance frameworks strengthen the ecosystem rather than slowing it down.\nInvest in financial literacy\nThe government has committed significant resources to supporting MSMEs through multiple schemes and direct benefit transfers. Yet, adoption on the ground remains uneven. Many entrepreneurs are unaware of available schemes or unsure how to navigate access. In other cases, limited understanding of financial products leads to hesitation or underutilisation.\nDedicated funding for regional outreach, borrower education, and digital onboarding can bridge this gap. When MSMEs understand how credit products work, how repayments are structured, and how digital tools simplify operations, confidence and responsible borrowing behaviour improve. Financial literacy is not a peripheral issue. It directly influences credit quality, borrower outcomes, and the long-term resilience of the MSME ecosystem.\nStrengthen market access\nWhere execution has been consistent, outcomes have followed. Government procurement from MSMEs demonstrates what is possible when access frameworks function as intended.\nThe broader challenge lies in ensuring similar consistency across programmes. Delays, fragmented processes, and uneven implementation dilute impact. Strengthening last-mile execution through clearer processes, better coordination between institutions, and simplified borrower journeys can significantly improve trust and effectiveness.For MSMEs, predictability matters more than novelty. Reliable access to credit, manageable compliance, and consistent support systems allow entrepreneurs to plan, invest, and scale with confidence.\nLooking ahead\nIndia’s MSME ecosystem has demonstrated that it can formalise, digitise, and grow at scale when the foundations are right. Budget 2026 has an opportunity to shift the narrative from inclusion to expansion by focusing on system-level strengthening rather than incremental additions.\nBy modernising credit guarantees, reducing compliance friction, investing in awareness, and improving last-mile execution, the Budget can help MSMEs move from resilience to scale. If India wants its small businesses to become global exporters and national champions, policy must now evolve from enabling participation to enabling growth at scale.\n(Alok Mittal, Co-founder & Executive Chairman at Indifi Technologies.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "India’s proposed trade agreement with the European Union is set to intensify competition for key exporters such as Japan, the UK and US, with nearly $11 billion in trade potentially becoming contestable, according to a Moneycontrol analysis.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi announced the agreement on January 27 at India Energy Week, describing it as a landmark partnership between two major economic blocs.\n\"A big agreement was signed between the European Union and India. People are calling this the mother of all deals. This agreement will bring major opportunities for the public in India and Europe. This is a perfect example of a partnership between two major economies of the world. This agreement represents 25% of the global GDP and one-third of global trade,” the Prime Minister said.\nThe impact of the deal is expected to be uneven across trading partners but significant in scale. Of Japan’s roughly $48 billion exports to India, nearly $3.5 billion, or over 17 percent, falls into product categories where EU suppliers could become more competitive once preferential access comes into force.\nThe exposure is sharper for the United Kingdom, where close to 20 percent of exports to India, amounting to about $1.3 billion, lie in segments where EU firms are well placed to displace existing suppliers.\nThe US, despite exporting a smaller absolute value of goods to India than Japan or the UK, could still face competition in nearly $5.8 billion of trade, or around 15 percent of its exports. Russia, by contrast, appears relatively insulated, with just over 1 percent of its exports to India exposed to potential EU competition.\nThe pressure points vary by country. Japanese exports at risk are concentrated in high-value engineering and industrial goods, including machinery, electrical equipment, engines, precision instruments and filtering systems. These categories overlap closely with European strengths, particularly in Germany, France and Italy, where firms already have deep integration with Indian manufacturing supply chains.\nFor the UK, vulnerable segments are skewed towards scrap metals, aluminium and paper waste, vehicle components and aircraft parts—products that form a substantial share of Britain’s industrial exports to India and could face margin pressure once EU tariffs are lowered.\nThe US faces competition mainly in medical and surgical instruments, diagnostic reagents, communication equipment, polymers and petroleum-based products. Several of these categories are already witnessing rising EU participation globally, and tariff preferences could further tilt sourcing decisions in favour of European suppliers.\nFor Japan, the UK and US, the challenge is likely to be less about headline trade losses and more about defending market share in high-value segments, where pricing, regulatory standards and delivery timelines matter as much as tariffs.\nAs India deepens its trade ties with Europe, exporters from advanced economies may find themselves competing more directly than before—not only with Indian firms, but increasingly with EU suppliers operating on preferential terms.",

Track live updates here.\n“India will grant the EU tariff reductions that none of its other trading partners have received,” the statement said, adding that duties on cars will be gradually reduced from 110 percent to as low as 10 percent, while levies on car parts will be fully eliminated after five to ten years.\nTariffs of up to 44 percent on machinery, 22 percent on chemicals and 11 percent on pharmaceuticals will also be mostly eliminated, according to the Commission.\nA dedicated chapter in the EU-India free trade agreement will also help small and medium-sized businesses in the bloc to take full advantage of the new export opportunities.\nBoth sides will establish dedicated contact points to provide SMEs with relevant information on the FTA and assist with any specific issues they encounter when using the agreement’s provisions. SMEs are expected to particularly benefit from tariff reductions, removal of regulatory barriers, and the transparency, stability, and predictability provided by the agreement, the Commission explained.\nThe European Union and India concluded negotiations on a “historic, ambitious and commercially significant” free trade agreement (FTA) on January 27.\n\"This is the most ambitious trade opening that India has ever granted to a trade partner. It will give a significant competitive advantage for key EU industrial and agri-food sectors, granting companies privileged access to the world's most populous country of 1.45 billion people and fastest growing large economy, with an annual GDP of €3.4 trillion,\" the statement said.\nAccording to the Commission, the agreement will strengthen economic and political ties between the world’s second- and fourth-largest economies at a time of rising geopolitical tensions and global economic challenges, underscoring their shared commitment to economic openness and rules-based trade.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the deal marked a historic moment in relations between the two sides.\n“The EU and India make history today, deepening the partnership between the world’s biggest democracies...we have created a free trade zone of 2 billion people, with both sides set to gain economically,\" she said.\nNext steps\nNow that talks for the trade deal has concluded, the negotiated draft texts will be published shortly.\nOn the bloc's side, the texts will go through legal revision and translation into all official EU languages.\nThe Commission will then put forward its proposal to the Council for the signature and conclusion of the agreement.\nOnce adopted by the Council, the EU and India can sign the agreements.\n\"Following the signature, the agreement requires the European Parliament's consent, and the Council's decision on conclusion for it to enter into force. Once India also ratifies the Agreement, it can enter into force,\" according to the statement.\nThe EU and India had first launched negotiations for a free trade agreement in 2007.\nThe talks were suspended in 2013 and then relaunched in 2022. The 14th and last formal negotiating round took place in October 2025, followed by intersessional discussions at technical and political level.\n\"After a year of tireless engagement and more than a decade in the making, we have delivered the biggest FTA ever, a deal like no other. High tariffs down, opportunity unleashed...Now, our focus is clear: ensuring businesses reap tangible benefits from this FTA as quickly as possible,\" Maroš Šefčovič, EU's Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security said.",

        "full_content": "When Ursula von der Leyen recently described the proposed EU–India trade agreement as “the mother of all deals,” the phrase drew attention not only because of its ambition, but because of the extraordinary journey behind it. Few trade negotiations have lasted over two decades, survived multiple global crises, and still remained politically relevant.\nNegotiations encapsulate evolution of India’s approach to trade\nThe EU–India free trade talks are not merely a delayed agreement waiting to be concluded. They are a record of how India’s trade positions evolved over time, shaped less by a grand plan and more by changing domestic politics, global economic shocks, and shifting geopolitics.\nThe 22-year timeline shows why India hesitated early, why talks collapsed midway, and why the present moment looks fundamentally different. With negotiations now approaching a political close after more than a dozen rounds since 2022, the timing of the EU–India FTA has become as important as its content.\nEarly ambition and the limits of openness\nThe idea of a comprehensive EU–India trade agreement took shape in the early 2000s, when globalisation was widely seen as a growth engine. Formal negotiations began in 2007 under the Broad-based Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA), one of the most ambitious trade frameworks India had attempted. The scope was expansive. It covered goods, services, investment protection, intellectual property, and public procurement. But ambition soon collided with political and economic realities.\nThe European Union pushed for deep tariff reductions, particularly in automobiles, wines, and spirits, alongside stronger intellectual property protections and access to India’s public procurement markets. India, meanwhile, focused on services access, professional mobility, and regulatory flexibility, areas where European willingness was limited.\nAgriculture and asymmetric liberalisation\nAgriculture and dairy became some of the most politically sensitive fault lines. For India, opening these sectors was not just a trade issue but a livelihoods concern, given the scale of smallholder farming and the role of dairy in rural incomes. European efficiency and subsidies sharpened these fears. While agriculture was not the only sticking point, it came to symbolise India’s discomfort with asymmetric liberalisation.\nBy 2013, talks collapsed. This was not the outcome of a coherent long-term trade doctrine. It reflected uncertainty, domestic constraints, and the limits of what India was willing, or able, to concede at that stage of its economic development.\nCollapse, recalibration, and a changing global order\nThe years between 2013 and 2021 were shaped by forces far larger than the EU–India negotiations themselves. Global faith in free trade weakened sharply. The eurozone crisis exposed structural fragilities. Brexit disrupted Europe’s own trade orientation. Most significantly, the election of Donald Trump altered the global trade environment. Under Trump administration trade wars, tariff threats, and open scepticism toward multilateralism became normalised. Trade agreements were no longer viewed as purely economic instruments. Trade increasingly became a tool of exercising power.\nThis shift mattered for India. The global trading system itself grew less predictable. Even advanced economies began prioritising industrial policy, supply chain control, and national interest over liberal norms.\nIndia’s own decisions reflected this uncertainty. The choice to stay out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in 2019 was driven by concerns about manufacturing competitiveness, trade imbalances, and loss of policy space. Rather than pursuing large trade blocs, India began reassessing what kind of openness it could sustain.\nThis period did not produce a clear trade strategy overnight. Instead, it forced India to adapt, learning through disruption rather than design.\nRe-engagement shaped by geopolitics, not ideology\nWhen EU–India negotiations resumed in 2022, the context had shifted decisively. Europe was seeking to reduce its dependence on China and diversify supply chains. India had gained economic scale and geopolitical weight. The relationship was no longer defined by optimism, but by mutual necessity. The structure of the talks reflected this realism. Instead of a single sweeping agreement, negotiations were split into three parallel tracks: a free trade agreement, an investment protection agreement, and a geographical indications deal. This allowed progress without forcing resolution of every sensitive issue at once.\nThe substance of the negotiations also changed. Tariffs remained important, but newer concerns moved to the forefront, climate regulation, sustainability standards, data governance, and carbon-related trade measures. These issues now shape access to markets as much as tariffs once did.\nA more confident India that’s at the same time more cautious\nIndia’s engagement today is more confident, but it is also more cautious. This is not openness driven by ideology or reformist zeal. It is openness shaped by experience, global uncertainty, and strategic positioning.\nA predictable business environment is the biggest gain\nFor businesses and markets, the significance of the EU–India FTA lies less in immediate trade gains and more in predictability. Clearer rules, regulatory stability, and long-term access matter more than headline tariff cuts. Export-oriented firms benefit from certainty. Services firms gain from institutional cooperation. Smaller firms will face higher compliance costs, underscoring the need for domestic support.\nFor Indian companies, the real impact of the EU–India FTA will be felt less through headline tariff cuts and more through long-term regulatory certainty in one of the world’s largest consumer markets.\nLet us be realistic about immediate gains\nHowever, the scale of this potential should not be overstated. While the FTA may widen market access, rising green compliance costs, particularly carbon-related levies and sustainability standards, are likely to limit immediate gains for Indian exporters. The real challenge will lie in navigating these costs while simultaneously negotiating long-standing red lines, such as wines and spirits, public procurement, intellectual property protections, services mobility, and sensitive sectors like dairy and agriculture. The agreement’s success will depend not just on market opening, but on how these overlapping constraints are managed in practice.\nThe agreement will not mark a dramatic opening of the Indian economy. It will reflect how India’s trade positions evolved under pressure, responding to global shocks, political shifts, and a more contested world economy.\n(Tarun Agarwal is an Associate Fellow at the Center of Policy Research and Governance, New Delhi, where he leads the International Relations and Conflict vertical.)\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "India’s household savings rate remains an ouroboros, with net financial savings inching up to 5.2% of GDP from a near 50-year low of 5%, while household investments slipped down to 18.1% of GDP in FY24. Household financial liabilities hit a record 6.2% of GDP, trapping us in a savings-investment rut: barely saving enough yet piling on debt. These indicate that households are thriving on debt-driven consumption over sustainable savings and incremental investments. Budget 2026 must incentivise savings and clear debt to maintain economic equilibrium. This fragile balance underscores the evasive value of a ₹500 note, for instance.\nYet macroeconomic triumphs – such as real GDP growth of 8.2% – belie the two “rupee realities” playing out daily in urban India. Walking into a fine-dining restaurant in Mumbai last week, a visitor ordered an appetizer: three artistic dumplings with microgreens and a delicately dolloped sauce. It cost ₹500. Later, while passing by a favourite Udipi joint on the way home, a signboard read “Full Veg Thali - ₹500”: three curries, a big portion of rice, two sides, a tall glass of buttermilk.\nThe contrast is jarring: same city, same ₹500; differential value. This sobering realisation transcends beyond Food & Beverage (F&B), to the entire goods and services continuum. Besides, these are affluent examples limited to the stronger economic classes of society.\nValue across socio-economic strata\nAt the other end, ₹500 barely covers a one-way Sleeper class train ticket for a family of two migrant workers returning home to Meerut from Mumbai, often forcing them to travel unreserved, or delaying family reunions. Likewise, ₹500 sustains an auto driver for a week: twenty vada pavs at ₹20-25 each in Maharashtra cities.\nThese contrasting vignettes reveal a deeper narrative: has currency become unmoored from any stable sense of value? What is ₹500 really worth?\nIn 2014, a little over ₹60 bought one US dollar; today, that figure is around ₹90. What is silently insidious about this is that no one wakes up one fine morning and has a sudden realisation that their wallet is lighter. It’s gradual. Quiet. And incredibly surreptitious.\nYet, this silent catastrophe unfolds amid controlled domestic inflation, at 0.71% YoY and increased GDP per capita (PPP) from $1,212 in 1990 to $11,159 in 2024. On paper, living standards have improved – yet every day feels costlier.\nA rationale may be opined: gradual currency depreciation isn’t an isolated economic event; it’s a societal phenomenon of living in two simultaneous rupee realities.\nBudget 2026 must bridge this value gap between fine-dining establishments which price imported ingredients in a weaker rupee and cater to a clientele with global lifestyle aspirations, and Udipi restaurants which haven’t recalibrated as yet: they think, act and price local. This is not a mere emotional dilemma; it is an overlooked policy issue.\nEmployment and the Two Indias\nAs Budget 2026 expectations build, urgency mounts around tax slab revisions to ease middle-class pressures and revive savings, production-linked incentives to capitalise on the manufacturing sector, GST fixes to aid the services sector, to name a few. Yet the 8.2% real growth momentum masks vulnerabilities as households grapple with record-low savings trends. The Budget must strike the iron when it’s hot: targeted tax breaks, guaranteed gig worker social security, unlocked MSME loans,  and incentivised household savings are tools.\nBeneath this macroeconomic gloss – and the controlled 0.71% inflation – lies an overlooked economic chasm. In metropolitan cities, upper middle-class to High-Net-worth Individuals (HNIs) pay millions to get lifestyle club memberships, waiting periods for which span generations. That remains a distant dream for lower socioeconomic strata. This is the classic dichotomy of two Indias: ₹500 is ‘necessary luxury’ in one, basic sustenance in another.\nTowards equitable recalibration\nEconomic growth lifts consumption, yet low savings delay spending on homes and small businesses. Over the last decade, 171 million people escaped poverty, alongside multidimensional poverty which dropped to 15.5% in 2022-23. Yet, the urban-rural gap persists. This is the ₹500 divide personified: luxury dumplings versus survival vada pavs; inequality starkly amplified despite macro wins.\nApathy runs deep: we make daily decisions clinging onto money’s ‘constant’ myth. But true recalibration for the poor isn’t merely crossing unclear purchasing power thresholds; it’s gaining complete agency over determining what ₹500 means. Budget 2026 must confront this: youth unemployment at 10.2% leaves skilled youth jobless despite rising LFPR, while a substantial proportion of gig workers lack equitable labour protections.\nPolicy muscle is needed, now. To wake up from our avoidant slumber, we need to develop a more nuanced understanding of the entire three dumplings-versus-full meal paradox. We somehow still treat currency denominations as if they are universal units of value. The mindset change? Valuing value itself. We need to recalibrate earnings, spending and societal implications every single day.\nThrough concentrated recalibration effort, Budget 2026 can convert 8.2% blurry growth of 5.2% fragile savings into a robust capex engine: the government strikes the spark; households supply the fuel. The solution lies in mobilising a proactive multi-stakeholder network.\nThe ₹500 puzzle reveals shared policy failure, not zero-sum trap. It shows that money means everything (to some), but also, nothing (to others). This realisation changes everything: all stakeholders of society win when we embrace that stability was always an unsaid myth.\nThe solution lies in equitable policy design. We can redistribute the power of ₹500, in a way in which the rich businessmen gain demand; the downtrodden wield agency. The Budget is an opportunity to deliver tax relief, gig security and MSME lifelines, leaving no players unequipped. Growth serves all – no outliers.\n(Ninupta Srinath is a policy researcher and a law student.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "The European Union's (EU) Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which became operational on January 1, 2026, has placed India into an uncomfortable position, especially on the eve of signing of a free trade agreement between India and the EU.\nCBAM imposes carbon costs on imports based on their embedded emissions, effectively penalising India for the lack of a price on carbon via a carbon market. The 'Brussels effect' is visible and the message clear. Adopt an EU style market-based carbon pricing, or face trade penalties.\nFor India, this presents an immediate challenge, although the long-term direction is less confrontational. The short-term dilemma is about space for its development goals; the luxury of carbon pricing can follow at higher levels of per capita income without impinging economic sovereignty.\nPricing for negative externalities\nThe neo classical view of carbon pricing is elegant: internalizing the social cost of carbon through a uniform price signal allows atomistic decision makers to reduce emissions where marginal abatement costs are lowest. This Pigouvian principle has shaped climate economics for decades and now underpins the EU's approach to global trade in carbon-intensive goods such as steel and aluminium to name just two carbon intensive products, among many.\nTheory of the second best\nFor India, however, the immediate adoption of economy wide carbon pricing would have adverse economic and distributional effects, atop an already skewed distribution of income and wealth. The reasons lie not in the rejection of climate responsibility, but in the prevailing ground realities and what economists refer to as the theory of the second best.\nIn simple terms, the theory of the second best reminds us that in the presence of multiple distortions, fixing just one may be counterproductive. In other words, carbon pricing works well when markets are reasonably competitive, information flows are free, credit is accessible and distributional impacts can be managed through fiscal transfers. India meets none of these conditions in any meaningful manner. Besides, more than 80 percent of India operates in an informal setting where price signals are weak or non-existent.\nConsider for example access to credit, or lack thereof, for small and informal sectors operating outside regulatory frameworks. Imposing a carbon price in such an environment will not result in resource reallocation; instead it is more likely to spawn closures.\nChallenge posed by informality\nSmall and medium enterprises, a source of over 110 million jobs, may not be able to switch to cleaner technologies that require upfront investments they cannot finance. Similarly, over 800 million people who receive free food rations will be forced to limit consumption of electricity in case prices go up. The parallel with a past policy shock is instructive. Recall what demonetization did to India's informal sector; the lack of digital access to money (liquidity) in 2016 witnessed the closure of thousands of small enterprises, a shock from which many never recovered.\nCarbon pricing imposed prematurely could trigger a similar disruption, well intentioned in theory, crippling in practice.\nIndia’s implicit carbon pricing\nIndia's approach to emissions reduction has relied on what might be termed implicit carbon pricing through regulatory standards, technology mandates, and sectoral policies. Renewable purchase obligations require electricity distributors to source a rising share of power from renewable sources. Energy efficiency standards mandate improvements in industrial processes, appliances, and vehicles. Production-linked incentive schemes support manufacturing of solar panels, batteries, and electric vehicles. Fuel taxes, among the highest globally on petrol and diesel, discourage consumption while generating revenue.\nOrthodox or text book economics is impatient with quantitative instruments that distort markets. For example, if one has to restrict trade, tariffs are better than quotas they say because they allow price signals to remain relevant. Quotas result in monopolies and rent seeking it is argued. All no doubt true, in addition to the fact such instruments also lack the theoretical elegance of a uniform price signal. At the same time, India's renewable energy capacity has grown from 35 GW in 2014 to over 200 GW in 2025, making it the fourth-largest globally. Energy intensity of GDP has declined by 36 percent since 2005. Coal's share in the energy mix is falling even as total energy consumption rises.\nTaking care of the demand side of the equation\nIndia's approach to renewable mandates has also generated assured demand, allowing investments in manufacturing thereby generating economies of scale. On the demand side, this idea is similar to the LED bulbs case in which government purchased in bulk and sold at low price to consumers, creating a virtuous cycle of adoption. The lesson is that subsidies reduce upfront costs, making clean energy accessible to those who cannot afford the lifecycle savings that carbon pricing promises. Standards bypass the information and credit market failures that prevent firms and households from responding optimally to price signals.\nTime to transition out of gradualism\nWhen I weigh the evolution of India's economic policy landscape over the last several decades, one feature that stands out like a shining example or a sore thumb depending on your perspective.\nIn the wise words of Montek Ahluwalia, India has largely adopted an approach of gradualism to reform, what he termed 'course correction' rather than disruptive transformation. This philosophy, reflected in Deng Xiaoping's metaphor of feeling the stones while crossing a stream, has largely characterized India's economic liberalization since 1991. Whether it has or has not served India well is a matter of debate, but policy shocks and therefore disruptions have been few and far between.\nToday, however, the global political economy is such that the luxury of a gradualist approach is fading. The EU, having committed to ambitious climate targets and imposed carbon costs on its own industries, insists through CBAM that trading partners adopt equivalent measures. The patience for differential treatment based on development needs, embodied in the principle of \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" or CBDR in climate negotiations has melted.\nInternational trade flows are supposed to reflect differences in costs of production. Lower environmental costs however are no longer a legitimate source of comparative advantage. Even if we in India are willing to phase in stricter regulatory standards around climate change over time, the EU is in no mood to submit. This impatience is not entirely unreasonable because climate change is a global emergency and leakage of emissions to jurisdictions with lax standards undermines the EU's efforts. Or so we are told. If India can produce steel at lower cost partly because it faces no carbon constraints, European steelmakers face 'unfair' competition.\nAppropriate measure for reciprocity\nBut here is the rub. Reciprocity premised on identical instruments rather than comparable outcomes could be termed unfair (and inefficient). India's per capita income is one-thirtieth that of the EU. Its per capita cumulative emissions are a fraction of Europe's historical contributions. India's development imperatives, including ensuring energy access, require rising energy consumption even as emissions intensity of production declines. Imposing the luxury of carbon pricing immediately poses challenges, while ignoring ground realities.\nThe relevant question should not be whether India has an economy-wide carbon price matching the EU's €85 per tonne, but whether India's policy mix delivers comparable emissions trajectories adjusted for development stage and capacity.\n(Rajat Kathuria is Dean, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Shiv Nadar University, and Professor of Economics.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

These include trade protectionism, slowing global growth, and heightened geopolitical tensions.\n“No trade deal with the US could impact labour-intensive sectors leading to unemployed workers,” said Yuvika Singhal, economist at QuantEco Research.\n“Even as growth is fine, it’s not clear this will be a self-sustaining recovery given global risks and role of one off domestic tailwinds in FY26,” said Abhishek Upadhyay of ICICI Securities, highlighting that he remained cautiously optimistic.\nThe second-largest concern was private investment, highlighted by five economists, reflecting unease over whether corporate capex will pick up sufficiently as public investment begins to plateau.\nCapex, though expected to rise to Rs 12 lakh crore, would be lower at 3.05 percent of the GDp compared with 3.14 percent in the previous fiscal, according to Moneycontrol poll.\nConcerns around employment, consumption, recovery momentum, and nominal GDP growth featured next, though each drew fewer responses, indicating that domestic macro conditions are viewed as relatively stable for now.\nEconomist forecast nominal growth to hit 10.1 percent of the GDP in the coming fiscal.\n“A quicker pick-up in private corporate investment given that govt capex will need to start moderating to meet fiscal consolidation objectives,” said Dipti Deshpande, economist at Crisil.\nNotably, inflation, exchange rates, and credit conditions also attracted concern from some economists.\nThe story was also visible in economist’s concern around manufacturing and trade facilitation.\nNearly 90 percent of the economists noted that the government may continue its policy of manufacturing push in the upcoming budget, while 94 percent projected the government to expand the ambit of its schemes on trade facilitation.\n“Measures that help improve export competitiveness -especially through lower power and logistics costs and further easing of regulatory constraints. Given that significant role of MSMEs in export-intensive sectors such as textiles, leather, and plastics which have been disproportionately affected, the budget could be expected to announce more targeted support to the MSME segment,” said Deshpande.",

Economists expect the government to reach its medium-term debt stabilisation goal, with the debt-to-GDP ratio projected at a median of 55.2 percent in FY27. Estimates were tightly clustered between 54.6 percent and 55.7 percent, signalling limited concern over fiscal slippage.\n//\nIndia has set a target of bringing its debt-to-GDP ratio down to 50 percent by FY31, and the government is expected to increasingly shift focus from headline deficit numbers to debt metrics. For the previous fiscal year, the debt-to-GDP ratio was projected at 56.1 percent.\nThe relatively benign outlook reflects expectations of steady nominal GDP growth, moderate expenditure discipline, and continued reliance on market borrowing rather than off-budget financing.\nGross market borrowing is expected to remain elevated at Rs 16.5 lakh crore, but economists appear comfortable that higher borrowing will be absorbed without materially worsening debt dynamics, particularly if growth assumptions hold. For FY26, gross borrowing was already raised to Rs 14.82 lakh crore, from Rs 14.01 lakh crore in the previous fiscal.\nOn the growth front, economists expect the economy to record nominal GDP growth of 10.1 percent this fiscal, providing a supportive backdrop for fiscal consolidation efforts.",

        "full_content": "The Union Budget for FY27 is expected to remain expansive, though economists see signs of capex consolidation rather than acceleration, according to a pre-Budget survey of 20 economists conducted by Moneycontrol.\nThe median estimate for the total size of the Budget stands at Rs 53 lakh crore, with forecasts ranging from Rs 51.8 lakh crore to Rs 54.2 lakh crore. The range indicates expectations of continued high government spending even as fiscal consolidation remains a stated priority.\nThe government had projected total expenditure to cross Rs 50 lakh crore in FY26. However, ANZ economist Dhiraj Nim believes actual spending may fall short, estimating it at Rs 49.6 lakh crore in the current fiscal.\nCapital expenditure for FY27 is projected at a median of Rs 12 lakh crore, with estimates spanning Rs 11.5 lakh crore to Rs 13.1 lakh crore. As a share of GDP, capex is expected to stabilise at around 3.05 percent, marginally below the peak levels seen in recent years.\nIn FY26, capital expenditure, though lower in absolute terms at Rs 11.2 lakh crore, was estimated at 3.1 percent of GDP at the time of the Budget, underscoring how capex intensity has remained elevated even as growth rates begin to normalise.\nHSBC economists Pranjul Bhandari and Ayushi Chaudhary note that the government may meet its FY26 capex target and raise the allocation to Rs 12.3 lakh crore in the upcoming Budget.\nHowever, the pace of capex expansion is expected to moderate. Economists estimate growth of around 9 percent in FY27, compared with a 17 percent increase expected in the current fiscal, assuming the government meets its targets.\n“Continued emphasis on capital expenditure but with a shift in focus towards digital infrastructure and defence capital assets should be the priority,” said DK Srivastava, chief policy advisor at EY India.\nGross market borrowing is expected to remain elevated, reinforcing expectations that capex will continue to be financed primarily through debt rather than expenditure compression. Borrowing is projected to rise to Rs 16.5 lakh crore in FY27, even as the fiscal deficit is expected to ease to 4.2 percent of GDP from 4.4 percent in the current fiscal.

        "full_content": "As India stands at the cusp of the Union Budget 2026–27, the economic narrative is shifting from “recovery” to “resilient acceleration”. While the traditional engines of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP)—infrastructure, government spending, and consumption—continue to provide a sturdy base, the next frontier of India’s 8% GDP growth trajectory lies in the high-stakes world of innovation and deep technology. I believe Budget 2026 must be the catalyst that transforms India from a “service hub” into a “global IP powerhouse”.\nThe RDI Fund: From allocation to execution\nIn the previous budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman took a historic step by operationalising the ₹1 lakh crore Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI) Fund under the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF). The Ministry’s intent was clear: science- and technology-led growth must power India’s rise. Over the past year at haf.vc, I have observed a 30% increase in deep-tech pitches in just the last six months, focused on building the future of India.\nHowever, a significant portion of this corpus has been set aside for strategic deep-tech sectors. For Budget 2026, the mandate must be to accelerate the deployment of these funds. It has also been noted recently that 2026 will be a defining year for founders who can manage growth effectively through innovation. I expect the Finance Ministry to introduce more “Second-Level Fund Managers” (SLFMs) to ensure that the ₹20,000 crore annual tranches reach early-stage start-ups in AI, quantum computing, and semiconductors.\nBeyond infrastructure: the climate-tech imperative\nWhile industry continues to focus heavily on infrastructure, the real risk to GDP growth is not a lack of roads, but a shortage of indigenous patents. The government’s emphasis on capital expenditure has strengthened physical infrastructure such as roads and railways; however, the quality of investment must now pivot towards climate technology to future-proof growth.\nBudget 2026 should incentivise private equity flows into circular economy models and green hydrogen. By reinforcing the Ministry’s earlier commitment to “Atmanirbharta in energy”, the upcoming budget can unlock private investment through targeted tax credits for climate-tech R&D, distinct from traditional manufacturing incentives.\nNavigating global headwinds: the FTA strategy\nSome of our past investments have struggled amid global tariff headwinds, particularly in electronics and textiles. The current geopolitical climate has exposed the vulnerability of Indian exporters. With the rupee experiencing volatility through much of 2025, Budget 2026 must provide a fiscal cushion to enhance “cross-border resilience”.\nThe Finance Ministry’s recent stance has leaned towards strategic trade realignment. I expect this budget to:\n* Accelerate FTA integration: Increase allocations to the Department of Commerce to finalise high-quality FTAs with partners such as the UK, New Zealand, the EU, and Oman, reducing over-dependence on any single Western economy.\n* Mitigate rupee volatility: Introduce measures to encourage the internationalisation of the rupee, lowering transaction costs for MSMEs engaged in cross-border trade and enabling them to scale globally under the “Brand India” banner.\n* Tilt the balance of trade: Extend Productivity Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes to MSMEs with annual revenues of ₹100 crore and above, moving beyond assembly towards core component manufacturing and directly addressing the trade deficit.\nConsumption: the resilient anchor\nDespite global headwinds, India’s Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) has remained a pillar of strength. The Finance Ministry has previously highlighted “uplifting household sentiment” as a core objective.\nFor consumption to drive GSDP sustainably, however, it must be powered by rising disposable incomes rather than expanding credit. I expect Budget 2026 to prioritise rural demand recovery, ensuring that the consumption engine is fuelled by productivity gains and local manufacturing, supported by innovation in agriculture.\nThe role of innovation in boosting GDP\nOver the past 15 years, India’s innovation and start-up ecosystem has evolved from comfort-driven solutions to convenience-led platforms. As Dr Jitendra Singh recently noted, “India is no longer the India of yesterday; our aspiration is to lead the technologies of the future.”\nWith over 170,000 start-ups, innovation is central to achieving the “Viksit Bharat” vision. Innovation-led growth has a multiplier effect on GDP that traditional sectors often lack. When a deep-tech start-up in Hyderabad secures a global patent in health-tech or space-tech, it creates high-value jobs and attracts long-term, sticky foreign direct investment.\nBudget 2026 must continue the momentum of decriminalising minor procedural lapses and simplifying the regulatory framework for Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs). At a time when consumption-led growth is reaching an inflection point, regulatory friction risks slowing the investment cycle that is critical for sustained expansion.\nConclusion: the roadmap for 2026\nThe synergy between government spending, private consumption, and infrastructure has propelled India into the global top five economies. To advance into the top three, Budget 2026 must focus on deepening the RDI pool, scaling climate-tech incentives, diversifying trade through FTAs to shield Indian innovation from global tariff conflicts, and boosting domestic productivity by incentivising the “component creator” over the “assembler”.\nI see 2026 as the year when capital meets curiosity. If the upcoming budget can bridge the gap between R&D laboratories and global markets, India’s investment-led growth will become a lasting legacy—not merely a statistic.\n(Rathnakar Samavedam, Investment Director and Managing Partner at Hyderabad Angels Fund).\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "In September 2018, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in the Aadhaar case, which addressed the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar Act. One of the key issues before the Court was whether the passage of the Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill was constitutionally valid.\nTwo contrasting views on Aadhaar Act falling within purview of a Money Bill\nJustice Ashok Bhushan, writing for the majority, held that Parliament was competent to pass the Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill under Article 110 of the Constitution. He reasoned that the primary objective of the Act is to facilitate the delivery of State subsidies and benefits, the expenditure for which is drawn from the Consolidated Fund of India. Article 110(1)(c) provides that a Bill qualifies as a Money Bill if it contains provisions relating to the custody of the Consolidated Fund of India. Relying on Article 110(3), Justice Ashok Bhushan concluded that the Aadhaar Act satisfied the constitutional requirements of a Money Bill.\nIn contrast, Justice DY Chandrachud dissented, holding that the passage of the Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill was unconstitutional. He emphasised that for a Bill to qualify as a Money Bill, it must contain only those provisions that fall within clauses (a) to (g) of Article 110(1). According to Justice Chandrachud, a close reading of the Aadhaar Act reveals that it regulates several aspects of the Aadhaar scheme that extend beyond the scope of Article 110(1). Moreover, he held that Section 7 of the Act does not itself authorise expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India; it merely makes Aadhaar mandatory in cases where such expenditure is incurred.\nWhile the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar Act was upheld and the majority accepted its passage as a Money Bill, Justice Bhushan affirmed that the matter is subject to future judicial review.\nIn July 2024, the then Chief Justice of India, DY Chandrachud, said that the Supreme Court would soon take a decision on listing the “Money Bill” issue for hearing. Earlier, in October 2023, the Supreme Court had stated that it would constitute a seven-judge Constitution Bench to adjudicate the matter. The question of which Bills can validly be classified as Money Bills was originally referred to a seven-judge Bench in November 2019 by a five-judge Bench led by then Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi in the Roger Mathew v. South Indian Bank Ltd case.\nUnique place of the Money Bill\nThe Money Bill is one of the most important legislative provisions entrusted to the legislature within the Indian parliamentary system. What makes a Money Bill unique is its subject matter and special procedural safeguards. As defined under Article 110 of the Indian Constitution, a Money Bill deals exclusively with financial matters such as taxation, public expenditure, and issues relating to the Consolidated Fund of India.\nA Money Bill can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha and requires the prior recommendation of the President, making presidential consent an inherent requirement in its introduction. Unlike ordinary legislation, the Rajya Sabha does not have the power to amend or reject a Money Bill; it may only make recommendations, which the Lok Sabha is free to accept or reject.\nFurthermore, the authority to decide whether a Bill qualifies as a Money Bill rests with the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. Under Article 110(3), the Speaker’s decision is final.\nEvolution of Money Bill\nThe framers of the Indian Constitution borrowed the principle of bicameralism from the British parliamentary system. The origin of conferring a limited role on the Upper House in the passage of Money Bills can be traced to the British Parliament Act, 1911.\nSection 3 of the Act accords finality to the Speaker’s certification of a Money Bill and places it beyond judicial scrutiny. It expressly provides that any certificate issued by the Speaker of the House of Commons under the Act shall be conclusive for all purposes and shall not be questioned in any court of law.\nLong backstory of the Money Bill\nAn understanding of India’s constitutional history is essential to fully appreciate the scope and implications of the finality accorded to the Speaker’s decision on whether a Bill qualifies as a Money Bill.\n* In India, the categorisation of Money Bills can be said to have begun from the Commonwealth of India Bill 1925, which was drafted by a National Convention comprised of 250 members, with Tej Bahadur Sapru as its Chairman.\n* Article 17 of the Nehru Report also defined a Money Bill.\n* The draft prepared by the Constitutional Advisor, BN Rau, defined a Money Bill. Article 75 of this Draft Constitution provided that “if any question arises whether a Bill is a ‘money bill’ or not, the decision of the Speaker of the House of the People thereon shall be final.”\n* Section 37 of the Government of India Act 1935 made special provisions for financial bills.\n* The statutory concept of a “Money Bill” and the Speaker’s power to certify a Bill as such, originally introduced by the British Parliament Act, 1911, was incorporated into the Indian constitutional framework with significant modifications. While the 1911 Act accorded absolute finality to the Speaker’s certification by expressly providing that it “shall not be questioned in any court of law,” the framers of the Indian Constitution consciously departed from this language and instead adopted the phrase “shall be final.”\n* This distinction is significant, as the British constitutional system is founded on parliamentary sovereignty, whereas the Indian constitutional order is premised on the supremacy of the Constitution. Judicial review is an essential feature of the Indian constitutional scheme as it ensures that all constitutional authorities act within the bounds of the Constitution. Consequently, no constitutional institution in India, including the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, exercises unfettered or absolute power. The Speaker’s decision to certify a Bill as a Money Bill is therefore not immune from judicial scrutiny and may be examined on the touchstone of compliance with constitutional principles.\nSpeaker’s decision doesn’t have immunity from judicial scrutiny\nAs highlighted by the apex court in the Aadhar judgment, the claim that the Speaker’s decision is immune from judicial review and cannot be challenged runs counter to the fundamental framework of the Constitution, which is founded on principles of “transparency, fairness, and non-arbitrariness”.\nIn the Aadhar case, the apex court made a significant point. It stated that the constitutional function is entrusted to the Speaker to certify a Bill as a Money Bill under Article 110(3), to which the attributes of a judicial power do not apply. Indeed, the power which is entrusted to the Speaker under Article 110(3) is integral to the legislative process. But the fact that the authority which a constitutional functionary exercises is not of a judicial character is not sufficient to lead to the conclusion that a finality clause governing the exercise of that power makes it immune from judicial review.\nThe apex Court in the Aadhar case also dealt with the question whether the Speaker’s decision under Article 110(3) is protected by Article 122. It opined that Article 122 will not save the action of the Speaker if it is contrary to constitutional norms provided under Article 110. The Court, in the exercise of its power of judicial review, can adjudicate upon the validity of the action of the Speaker if it causes constitutional infirmities. Article 122 does not envisage exemption from judicial review if there has been a constitutional infirmity. Justice A. K. Sikri, writing for the majority, observed that Article 212 only limited challenges on the ground of ‘irregularity of procedure’ and not ‘substantive illegality’.\n(Views are personal, and do not represent the stance of this publication.)",

        "full_content": "These are extraordinary times, and instinctively, countries are pivoting towards unprecedented policy measures to boost growth and, more importantly, build resilience to sustain momentum in a fast-evolving global order. The free-trade world order as we have known it appears to be significantly upended, with an emerging trade regime shaped by strategic multi-alignment in foreign policy.\nIndia’s growth outlook\nIndia, as part of the Global South and among the fastest-growing large economies, is well positioned to deliver high growth over the next decade. At the same time, it will increasingly bet on strategic bilateral and multilateral relationships, with policy choices closely aligned to its geopolitical priorities.\nBudget a pivotal policy moment\nIn this context, Budget 2026 represents a hugely significant moment in India’s policy landscape. This year’s budget announcement could serve as a crucial pivot in India’s industrial and trade policy framework, underpinning its geopolitical deftness while sharpening the contours of the domestic growth agenda. A particular emphasis is likely to be placed on boosting urban and rural consumption, with the aim of triggering a virtuous cycle of private and public investment.\nFrom a taxes and duties standpoint, Budget 2026 presents a valuable opportunity for the government to undertake tariff reforms and realignments, and to address structural deficiencies such as inverted duty structures. Doing so would enable businesses to optimally leverage the benefits of bilateral free trade agreements and impending multilateral trade agreements with key partners. In an environment of rising economic nationalism and protectionist tariff regimes globally, this could emerge as one of the most significant takeaways.\nTax certainty and investment confidence\nMoreover, with the income tax law due for a reset in April 2026, sweeping structural changes should not be expected in this budget. However, there is scope to refine the legislation slated for implementation, particularly to enable more flexible mergers, acquisitions, and restructuring. This could include resolving persistent issues such as the taxation of contingent payouts, ensuring full tax neutrality for all forms of demergers, and delivering last-mile simplification of the capital gains tax regime by eliminating selective instances of tax rate arbitrage.\nThe growing incidence of litigation arising from the administration of the General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR) warrants a serious review of their scope and application, before these issues snowball into a major impediment to foreign direct investment inflows. Claims for tax benefits under bilateral tax treaties with certain investment partner countries often face excessive scrutiny, which tends to unsettle even bona fide investors by increasing uncertainty around tax costs for both primary and secondary investments. The issuance of clearer guidelines on the application of these rules would go a long way towards making India’s tax framework more predictable and investor-friendly.\nFinally, there is an urgent need for targeted incentives for R&D and investments in new technologies such as AI infrastructure. Historically, India’s tax regime has been largely neutral, with only a handful of fragmented incentives that have done little to encourage large-scale investment in these areas. As AI increasingly influences nearly every sector, Budget 2026 offers a timely opportunity to democratise access to the benefits of this technological revolution by enabling risk capital to flow more freely, supported by a calibrated and purposeful tax incentive framework.\n(Sumit Singhania, Partner, Deloitte India.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "China is sharply increasing its imports of Russian oil in January, taking in barrels that would earlier have gone to India and Turkey, as tougher Western sanctions force Moscow to divert crude flows, according to LSEG data and traders cited by news agency Reuters.\nThe shift follows sweeping sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union in late 2025 on Russian oil sellers and shippers, including energy majors Rosneft and Lukoil. The measures have made purchases more complex for global buyers and tightened scrutiny of Russian crude exports.\nPreliminary LSEG data shows China is set to receive nearly 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil by sea this month, up from around 1.1 million bpd in December. Alongside its steady appetite for Russian Far East ESPO Blend, Beijing has also ramped up imports of Russian Urals crude to a record 405,000 bpd in January — the highest level since mid-2023 — according to data from energy consultancy Kpler.\nIndia, which had emerged as the largest buyer of Russian Urals by sea after the European Union embargoed Moscow’s oil in 2022, cut its purchases to below 1 million bpd in December. This marked a sharp fall from the average of about 1.3 million bpd seen last year, LSEG data showed. Indian refiners are expected to keep imports of Russian oil close to 1 million bpd in January as they diversify supply sources.\nTurkey, another major buyer of Russian crude, has also pared back its intake. Urals imports into Turkey slipped to around 250,000 bpd in January, compared with an average of 275,000 bpd in 2025 and well below the peak of nearly 400,000 bpd recorded in June last year.\n“As Indian and Turkish buyers cut purchases recently, some Russian Urals cargoes headed for China,” said a trader involved in Russian oil sales. He added that the surplus availability of Urals barrels has weighed on prices.\nReflecting weaker demand elsewhere, discounts for Urals crude delivered to China in late 2025 widened to as much as $12 a barrel below ICE Brent for certain cargoes. Currently, Urals differentials are hovering near a $10-per-barrel discount to the global benchmark, according to two traders active in the Asian market.\nTraders noted that demand for Urals crude in India and Turkey — both key exporters of diesel to Europe — has softened after the EU banned fuels made from Russian-origin crude, further reshaping global oil trade flows.",

        "full_content": "India and the European Union are widely expected to announce the conclusion of talks for a free trade agreement on January 27 that leaders on both sides have described as the “mother of all deals.”\nA wide-ranging free trade agreement could widen India’s trade surplus with the European Union by over $50 billion by FY31, potentially lifting the bloc’s share in India’s exports to 22–23 percent from 17.3 percent in FY25, Emkay Global said in a research note on January 25.\nEven though India accounts for just about 0.8 percent of the EU’s export market, the deal is increasingly important for Europe as well, with its trade deficit with India widening sharply to $15 billion in FY25 from a $3 billion surplus in FY19, and as the bloc looks to diversify its trade away from an over-reliance on the China plus-one strategy, the note said.\nThe upside is expected to be driven by a steady move up the value chain in India’s EU-bound exports, with higher-value segments such as electronics, machinery and chemicals gaining share over traditional labour-intensive goods.\nThe potential upside is crucial as EU’s share in India’s exports has inched down to 16.8 percent so far in FY26.\nEurope’s widening trade deficit with India, reduced reliance on Russian energy and efforts to diversify supply chains away from China have already boosted demand for Indian refined fuels, electronics and chemicals, trends that an FTA could further accelerate, the note said.\nIn FY25, India–EU goods trade exceeded $136 billion, with Indian imports at $60.7 billion, while exports stood at 75.9 billion.\nIndian exports to European Union, such as smartphones, garments, footwear, tyres, pharmaceuticals, auto parts, refined fuels and cut diamonds, largely substitute the bloc’s imports from third countries rather than compete with EU manufacturing, which has long offshored these activities, GTRI’s Founder Ajay Srivastava noted.\nEU exports, high end machinery, aircraft, core electronic components, chemicals, quality medical devices and metal scrap, feed India’s factories, recycling industry and MSME clusters, raising productivity and export competitiveness, he added.\nThe FTA between the two nations is expected to lower or eliminate tariffs for India’s labour-intensive sectors, while EU may gain greater market access for its high-end cars and wines.\n“Because both economies specialise in different segments, tariff elimination works as a cost-reduction tool rather than a displacement shock. An India–EU FTA would thus deliver classic trade gains, higher volumes, deeper integration and stronger industrial competitiveness on both sides, at a moment when such economically rational trade arrangements are becoming increasingly rare,” Srivastava said.\nIn February 2025, India and the EU decided to ramp up talks for the proposed free trade agreement, targeting to initially close it by the end of that year to tide over ongoing disruptions from volatile trade policies.\nBeing negotiated for nearly two decades, the India-EU trade deal has 24 chapters across goods and services.",

        "full_content": "India’s official GDP numbers are set to become more granular and less volatile, as the government moves to embed high-frequency administrative datasets, such as GST filings, vehicle registrations from the e-Vahan portal and natural gas consumption, directly into quarterly growth calculations.\nThe Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) said on January 23 that it is reviewing the methodology used to compile quarterly GDP as part of the transition to a new national accounts series with FY23 as the base year. The proposed overhaul has been detailed in a discussion paper released for stakeholder consultation.\nAt present, India’s quarterly GDP estimates rely on a benchmark–indicator approach, where high-frequency indicators are aligned to annual national accounts benchmarks. While this ensures consistency with annual data, it produces sharp revisions and visible breaks in the series whenever annual numbers are updated.\nMoSPI now plans to move to a proportional benchmarking technique, a method widely used in advanced statistical systems globally. Instead of forcing quarterly data to mechanically align with annual totals, proportional benchmarking preserves the underlying movement of economic indicators. According to the discussion paper, this shift should result in smoother quarterly growth trajectories and fewer abrupt revisions.\nA central pillar of the revamp is the expansion of high-frequency administrative data used to estimate economic activity. GST return data is expected to play a larger role in tracking trade, manufacturing and services, while vehicle registrations from the e-Vahan database will help refine estimates in transport and related sectors. Energy indicators, such as natural gas consumption, are likely to improve measurement in industrial activity and utilities.\nThese additions are particularly significant for sectors like construction, transport, trade and manufacturing.\nThe changes will be rolled out alongside the broader rebasing of national accounts. The revised quarterly GDP series, aligned with the FY23 base year, is scheduled to be released in February 2026, together with updated annual GDP estimates.",

With India graduating from 12 major product categories, about €1.66 billion of trade will no longer enjoy GSP benefits, leaving €11.24 billion still eligible under the scheme, the ministry clarified.\nGraduation process is based on competitiveness of country’s exports which is periodically reviewed by EU.\nIndia’s graduation over time is on account of increasing competitiveness of its exports.\nThe European Commission has adopted a new regulation (EU 2025/1909) that suspends certain GSP tariff benefits for some countries, including India, from January 1, 2026 to December 31, 2028.\nUnder the new GSP treatment, agricultural lines are not graduated. In the non-agricultural sector, only leather has been reinstated.\nThe suspension covers 13 specific GSP sections, including mineral products; inorganic and organic chemicals; plastics and articles thereof; rubber and articles thereof; textiles; articles of stone, plaster, cement, asbestos, mica or similar materials; ceramic products; glass and glassware; pearls and precious metals; iron, steel and articles of iron and steel; base metals (excluding iron and steel) and articles thereof; machinery and mechanical appliances; electrical machinery and equipment and parts thereof; railway or tramway locomotives and rolling stock; and motor vehicles, bicycles, aircraft, spacecraft, ships and boats.\nThe European Union’s GSP is a unilateral trade preference scheme under which the EU grants reduced or zero customs duties to imports from developing and least-developed countries.\nThe GSP is non-reciprocal and operates as an exception to the WTO’s Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) principle.\nIts permanent legal basis under WTO law is the 1979 Enabling Clause, which allows developed countries to grant differential and more favourable treatment to developing countries.\nThe European Union offers different trade benefits under the GSP scheme.\nStandard GSP gives poorer and lower-middle-income developing countries, like India, easier access to EU markets.\nGSP+ is an enhanced version that provides more benefits, but only to countries that follow international rules on labor, human rights, the environment, and governance, while Everything But Arms (EBA) gives the poorest nations duty-free, quota-free access to almost all goods except weapons.",

        "full_content": "The Reserve Bank of India’s annual supervisory inspection for FY25 has flagged inconsistencies in how a few private sector banks classified agriculture loans under priority sector lending (PSL), triggering provisions and reclassification of certain consumption-linked loans.\nWhile the issue does not raise asset quality concerns, it has brought back focus on divergent interpretations of PSL norms and disclosure practices among banks.\nMoneycontrol explains the issue, why it surfaced during the RBI’s annual inspection, and why it is a classification challenge rather than an asset quality concern.\nSo, what is the issue?\nAgriculture loans,  which form the chunk of priority sector lending (PSL), is extended based on the area of cultivable land available and a corresponding valuation attributed to it. Norms also permit banks to lend a certain value (up to 20 percent of total permissible limit) towards the consumption requirements of the borrower. A two-wheeler loan, for instance can be a consumption loan as helps improving the working conditions of the borrower.\nHowever, the combined value of all loans should fall within the overall commercial valuation attributed to the land. For a few banks, this wasn’t the case, with the combined value exceeding the permissible loan amount which the borrower is entitled to. Excesses were largely found largely with respect to the consumption loans.\nThe banking regulator wants this anomaly corrected.\nHow did the problem surface?\nThe discrepancies were found in the process of annual inspection for FY25, which the Reserve Bank of India periodically conducts across regulated entities. Inspection revealed that agri-loans lent by a few banks were non-compliant with PSL norms as non-agro loan component exceeded the permissible loans amount of the borrowers. Hence as corrective step, these loans (loans given for consumption purpose) need to be reclassified as they don’t fall within the PSL limits.\nIs this as asset quality concern?\nThe issue relates to asset classification rather than asset quality, according to sources. It is understood to be limited to a handful of private sector banks, with Axis Bank, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank having already taken corrective steps. No such pattern has been observed among public sector banks.\nCan it be reversed?\nYes. Any reversal, however, is expected to be gradual and unlikely before March 31, 2028. The first step would involve reclassifying these loans as non-agriculture advances, a process that would require banks to formally notify borrowers. Any regulatory dispensation or moratorium extended earlier would also need to be regularised, including interest rates, as several of these loans had benefited from interest subvention available to agriculture credit. As a result, borrowers could face higher lending rates post-reclassification, which may test their repayment capacity. While this risk has not been factored in so far, a deterioration in repayment ability could eventually have implications for asset quality.\nHow have banks approached the issue?\nWhile the underlying issue is common across India’s top three private sector banks, their approaches to disclosure have varied significantly. A bank-by-bank look highlights these differences.\nAxis Bank\nDiscrepancies in agri-loans portfolio was first brought to fore by Axis Bank in its September FY26 quarter results. The bank flagged off in its notes to accounts about a certain elevated provisioning it took in Q2FY26 pertaining to its agri-loan portfolio flagged off by the RBI’s annual inspection. “…we will not give you details around specific number of accounts. The bank had been offering one of the two product variants from 2015 and the other variant from 2021. These are farmer loans and these had been classified as PSL. The bank has discontinued these two product variants, i.e., we are not doing these specific variants currently. For the loans that we had in stock, the bank has taken a position that the customer terms should not be changed to the detriment of the customer have an issue,” the bank’s CFO, Puneet Sharma told in a post earnings call with investors. “We have declassified these loans from our PSL computation entirely and we purchased the PSLCs for which the cost I have explained. The Rs 1,231 crores translates roughly a 5 percent cover on the total outstanding pool as of the 30 September,” he replied to another question in the call. Terming the provision as ‘static’ on the call, he said the bank does not expect an increase in credit costs from previous years for these two (dis)continued loan product variants. Sharma also indicated that “when the Rs 24,000 crores (of loans) goes to zero, I will get the full credit back into my P&L on that date”, which is expected by March 2028.\nHDFC Bank\nHDFC Bank did not mention the agri-loans related issue in its notes to accounts or press releases. Had it not been for a question raised by Mahrukh Adajania, a senior equity researcher at Nuvama Institutional Equities, the Rs 500 crore of provisioning the bank took on these loans post the RBI annual inspection would have not been made public. “Our regulatory inspection is also complete, and whatever according to required -- according to the regulatory requirement, there was about Rs 5 billion (Rs 500 crore) or so thereabouts, which have been taken. In the overall context of our book and our results they have been absorbed within that. In future, we need to operate in a model that is acceptable with the regulatory, whatever is that is (and) that’s an ongoing process of what we do. Any one-time is already subsumed,” said Srinivasan Vaidyanathan, CFO, HDFC Bank. While in terms of quantum the provisioning is not material, that fact that India’s largest private bank had to wait for a question to be raised in its investor call to address an important point flagged off by the RBI in its annual supervision isn’t comforting. Ideally, the bank should reported the RBI observation voluntarily. When asked why the bank did not make a voluntary disclosure, its response was “Please note that this does not cross any regulatory threshold that warrants a disclosure in the Q3FY26 results. The Bank continues to have adequate provisions at the total level. On the Investor call, the answer provided was in response to a specific question from an Analyst. And both call details - Investor and Media calls - are in the public domain for transparency”.\nICICI Bank\nWhile in terms of absolute value, ICICI Bank’s provisioning towards agri-loans portfolio was the highest at Rs 1,283 crore, the bank needs to be appreciated for its disclosure standards. It was voluntary and it revealed that it was done as per RBI’s supervision report. “….following the supervisory review, the regulator has directed us to make this provision of Rs 1,283 crore. The underlying portfolio that we need to work out and resolve in terms of ensuring conformity with the PSL guidelines would be between Rs 200 billion to Rs 250 billion or so (Rs 20,000 – 25,000 crore). We will be working on to bring this portfolio into conformity with the regulatory expectations, and thereby, minimise both the provisioning and the PSL impact,” said Anindya Banerjee, CFO, ICICI Bank adding that the bank has been originating this portfolio for some years.\nOverall, the PSL-related issue evokes memories of the asset quality review phase of 2016–18—not in terms of the scale of stressed assets, but in the way similar exposures can be interpreted differently by banks. The key concern is the lack of uniformity in interpretation, even as the system remains far from a repeat of the bad-loan cycle. For now, the issue appears contained, though market participants will be watchful for any further developments.",

The narrowing of the gap between nominal and real GDP growth was reflected in the fall in GDP deflator inflation, which dipped to its lowest level in 2025-26.\nEconomic activity continued to register a strong growth in December.

        "full_content": "After sharply paring exposure to group credit life insurance amid stress in the microfinance (MFI) segment over the past year, India’s private life insurers are beginning to see early signs of recovery, with management at leading companies pointing to a turnaround in the December quarter.\nMoneycontrol has earlier reported that the number of lives covered by insurers declined sharply in FY25 as rising mortality claims and asset-quality stress in microfinance forced insurers to retreat from group credit life insurance, which is a product typically bundled with MFI loans that settles outstanding dues in the event of a borrower’s death.\nRegulatory disclosures shows that India’s top four private life insurers — HDFC Life Insurance, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, SBI Life Insurance and Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance — together cut group insurance operations by nearly 30 percent year-on-year in FY25, almost double the industry-wide contraction of 16 percent. The pullback was largely driven by a reduction in credit life exposure linked to MFI loans.\nLending stablising\nIn a Q3 earnings call, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance chief financial officer Dhiren Salian acknowledged that weakness in the MFI-linked credit life business weighed on growth over the nine-month period but said the trend began to reverse in Q3.\n“In the nine months, we do have an impact of slower growth, or rather decline, that we have seen in the MFI business of credit life. The good part is that we are starting to see MFI turn around. I wouldn't say it’s out of the woods yet, but very clearly, we have started to see a turnaround coming through in Q3,” Salian said.\nThe improvement reflects broader stabilisation in microfinance lending. “This is in line with the commentary you’re hearing generally around MFI credit, the core business of credit. As that business starts to build up, we should be a natural beneficiary of that,” he said.\nPremium data underscores the scale of the pullback. HDFC Life’s group new business premium (NBP) declined 25 percent year-on-year in FY25, ICICI Prudential 28 percent, SBI Life 30 percent and Bajaj Allianz Life’s declined 23 percent. As a result, the number of lives covered by these four insurers fell by a combined 4.7 crore, from 18 crore in FY24 to 13.3 crore in FY25, marking a 25 percent contraction.\nAn official at one insurer attributed the retreat to worsening claims experience. “The high-risk borrower pools and increasing claims have made it difficult to sustain large-scale credit life portfolios,” the official had said, pointing to post-COVID volatility in the MFI sector.\nInsurers are now seeing early green shoots. HDFC Life Insurance reported a sharp rebound in credit-linked protection in the December quarter. Managing director and chief executive officer Vibha Padalkar said during the earnings call, “Credit protect rebounded strongly in quarter three. The MFI segment saw a pickup aided by a favourable base, while non-MFI segments continued to deliver steady growth.”\nThe recovery in credit-linked business is part of a broader strengthening in protection-led growth, she said. “Retail sum assured grew 33 percent over the nine-month period and 55 percent in quarter three. This growth was supported by higher rider attachment and increased sum assured multiples in ULIP business, reinforcing the quality of growth and alignment with long-term protection objectives,” she said.\nMargin pressure to ease\nHDFC Life CFO Niraj Shah said credit life, which is a pure protection product, has begun to perform strongly as system-wide credit growth improves.\n“Credit life as a segment has started to do really well, with around 25 percent growth in this quarter and about 15 percent growth for the period,” Shah said. “With the credit growth in the overall system being at fairly strong levels and expected to continue to improve, that is also a business line which will further the cause.”\nShah added that improving scale in protection and credit-linked business should help ease margin pressures over time. “As we start moving towards growth numbers that we are capacitised for, the negative variance that you see on account of fixed cost leverage is something that we would expect to try and bring down over time,” he said, citing regulatory changes such as GST rationalisation and stronger embedded protection within unit-linked products as key catalysts.\nMoneycontrol has earlier reported that the sharp fall in credit life policies could prompt regulatory scrutiny, with a source indicating that the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) may consider measures such as premium floors or targeted incentives to ensure coverage in socially critical but low-margin segments like credit life. The regulator did not respond to queries at the time of publishing of this report .\nFor now, insurers say they remain selective.\nBoth ICICI Prudential and HDFC Life stressed that they are agnostic to how customers buy protection, whether through group credit life, pure term plans or embedded protection, as long as the business meets defined risk-reward and quality thresholds.",

The dividend projected in the earlier budget will be realised after the end of the current financial year, as banks typically declare and transfer dividends after finalising their annual results. The RBI, meanwhile, generally transfers its surplus to the government in May.\nIn May 2025, the central bank paid a record Rs 2.69 lakh crore dividend to the government, reflecting higher income from foreign exchange operations amid global market volatility.\nDividend transfers from the RBI and PSBs have emerged as a key source of non-tax revenue for the government in recent years, helping provide fiscal headroom even as capital expenditure remains a priority.\nIn financial year 2024-25, the central bank net sold $69.661 billion, and purchased $25.15 billion. Such heightened selling of dollars may have increased the revenue for the central bank.\nThe logic implies that like in any commercial transaction, the RBI accumulated dollars cheap and sold it when the price rose. The central bank accumulated dollars in the 83-84 range a dollar and sold in the 84-87 range.\nThe RBI dividend is a major revenue source for the government. As the manager of its finances, the RBI pays a dividend to the government to help from its surplus profit.",

Macquarie cautioned that assumption changes expected in Q4FY26 could pose downside risks to ICICI Prudential’s FY26 margins and EV, despite stable current profitability.",

Growth indicators show pickup in domestic demand supported by GST cuts and monetary policy easing by RBI,” said Gaura Sengupta, Economist at IDFC First Bank.\nHowever, few experts believe that the central bank will cut rates by 25 basis points (Bps) in the upcoming monetary policy.\nThe MPC is to meet from February 4 and February 6 for its bi-monthly policy review.\nSince February, 2025, the MPC has reduced the repo rate by 125 bps to aid growth, with a 25 bps cut each in February and April, 50 bps in June, and 25 bps in December. However, the RBI has kept repo rate unchanged in August and October monetary policy.\nThe central bank will stick to its “neutral” stance and keep its tone dovish in the upcoming policy, experts said. This tone is targeted at lowering interest rates to increase spending and lending, as well as giving a boost to growth.\n“Since both inflation and growth is panning out broadly in line with expectations, we do not see any convincing reason to change the monetary policy stance (or action),” said Vivek Kumar, Economist at QuantEco Research.\nInflation projection\nMost economists and experts remained on the divided view on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation projections. This is because, few experts said the central bank may remain in wait and watch mode before revising inflation forecast ahead of the new base year series for GDP and CPI.\nIndia’s inflation firmed up in December, rising to a three-month high of 1.33 percent from 0.7 percent in November, government data released on January 12 showed.\nEven with the uptick, headline inflation has now stayed below the RBI’s lower tolerance threshold of 2 percent for four consecutive months, underlining how price pressures have cooled meaningfully since the middle of the year.\nFor the year as a whole, inflation averaged about 2.2 percent in 2025, making it one of the lowest readings seen in over a decade, helped largely by a sharp easing in food prices.\nDecember also marks a transition point for India’s inflation statistics. It is the final consumer price index (CPI) reading under the 2012 base year. Starting with the January print — due on February 12 — the CPI series will shift to a new 2024 base, with an updated consumption basket that includes more items and assigns a higher weight to non-food components.\nThe change is significant because the current CPI is heavily food-weighted, with food accounting for more than half of the index. This makes headline inflation highly volatile, as sharp swings in vegetables, cereals or pulses can move the overall number even when non-food prices remain stable.\nGDP forecast\nSimilar to inflation, experts also remained divided on revision in growth projections.\nFollowing India’s impressive 8.2 percent GDP growth in the recent fiscal period, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has announced that the third-quarter (Q3) GDP for 2025–26 will be released using the new base year of 2022–23.\nSubhash Garg, Secretary at MoSPI, said on November 28, “The first advance estimate in January will follow the existing 2011–12 base, but the second advance estimate on February 27 and Q3 numbers will be calculated on the new base. To ensure continuity, we will also release Q1 and Q2 in the new series.”\nThe upcoming GDP series marks the first base-year revision since 2011–12.\nThe revised GDP methodology aims to better capture India’s evolving economic structure, including informal-sector activities and more accurate measurement of gross value added (GVA) across key sectors.\nIn December monetary policy, the RBI projected real GDP growth for 2025-26 at 7.3 per cent, with Q3 at 7.0 per cent; and Q4 at 6.5 per cent. Real GDP growth for Q1:2026-27 is projected at 6.7 per cent and Q2 at 6.8 per cent.",

Last time when the currency breached the 91 level against the greenback was on December 17, when it hit 91.06, according to Bloomberg data.\nThe rupee has been under pressure despite the dollar index being on a declining trend.\nForeign investors withdraw more than $3 billion\nAmit Pabari, managing director at CR Forex Advisors, explained this saying that foreign outflows remain the single-biggest drag.\nForeign investors have withdrawn more than $3 billion from Indian equities so far in January, and the steady outflow has made the rupee increasingly sensitive to even modest dollar demand. With capital moving out, stability becomes harder to defend.\n“Beyond FPI flows, trade uncertainty continues to hover in the background. The most critical unresolved issue remains the prospects of a comprehensive and balanced trade agreement between India and the United States,” Pabari added.\nThe Greenland angle\nFurther, the issue over Greenland has put pressure on the local currency.\n“Continued global uncertainties, including US pressure on Greenland, have led to a risk-off sentiment in markets. This has led to a strong demand for precious metals, with gold and silver prices touching an all-time high. The risk-off sentiment, along with strong offshore hedging in USDINR, has led to the USDINR touching 91 per dollar. The current macro environment is likely to maintain depreciating pressure on the INR,” said Sameer Karyatt, Executive Director and Head of Trading at DBS Bank India in a report.\nFurther, the DBS report said that US President Donald Trump’s campaign to impose American rule over Greenland in the name of national security is a concern.  Following a decision by Denmark and several European NATO allies to send military personnel to Greenland for an exercise, Trump threatened to impose a 10 percent additional tariff on goods from the UK, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland, starting February 1.\nThese levies are scheduled to rise to 25 percent on June 1 until a deal for the \"Complete and Total purchase of Greenland\" is finalised. This move has effectively derailed the July 2025 \"Turnberry\" trade agreement, which had temporarily stabilised tariffs at 15 percent, in exchange for zero duties on US industrial goods, the DBS report added.",

        "full_content": "India’s insurance industry is expected to see strong premium growth continue over the medium term, helping offset weak underwriting performance and rising claims, as insurers face capital pressures from faster business expansion and regulatory changes, according to a report by Moody's.\nMoody’s expects India’s economy to grow by 7.3 percent in FY26, up from 6.5 percent in FY25, supporting higher household incomes and demand for insurance products. Reflecting this trend, total insurance premiums rose 17 percent in the first eight months of FY25 to Rs 10.9 trillion, sharply accelerating from the 7 percent growth recorded in FY24.\nGrowth has been broad-based.\nLife insurance new business premiums rose 20 percent, while health insurance premiums increased 14 percent during the period, highlighting rising risk awareness among consumers.\nMoody’s noted that insurers’ increasing reliance on digital channels has significantly improved access and distribution, aligning with the regulator’s long-term goal of “Insurance for All” by 2047.\nDespite the rapid growth, insurance penetration remains low. Premiums accounted for just 3.7 percent of GDP in FY24, compared with 11.8 percent in the UK and 12.1 percent in the US, indicating significant headroom for expansion in the Indian market.\nState-owned sector reform key to pricing discipline\nA major constraint on profitability has been weak pricing discipline, largely driven by the dominance of state-owned insurers. According to Moody’s, public sector insurers have historically prioritised market share over underwriting profitability, exerting downward pressure on premiums across the industry.\nThe government’s ongoing efforts to reform the state-owned insurance sector, including recapitalisation, potential mergers, privatisation and the earlier minority stake sale in LIC, are seen as credit positive. Moody’s said improved underwriting discipline among public insurers would help support pricing across the market.\nHowever, the agency cautioned that the timing of these reforms remains uncertain, as similar initiatives have faced operational and legislative delays in the past. State-owned non-life insurers still accounted for 61 percent of the sector’s underwriting losses in FY24, even though their share of total premiums has fallen to 31 percent, from over 40 percent before FY20.\nClaims pressure weighs on underwriting results\nWhile the industry reported an after-tax profit of $8.1 billion in FY24, it remained loss-making at the underwriting level, due to rising claims in both life and non-life segments. Claims increased 6.4 percent in life insurance and 6.6 percent in non-life insurance during the year, Moody’s said.\nThe agency noted that any sustained improvement in pricing, particularly if led by reforms in the state-owned sector, would allow insurers to better absorb claims inflation, supporting solvency and profitability over time.\nMoody’s also highlighted the positive impact of the government’s decision in September 2025 to exempt individual life and health insurance policies from GST. The move has already led to higher new business volumes, with year-on-year growth in retail life and health premiums accelerating in FY25, supported by improved affordability.\nWhile the tax exemption is expected to lift insurance penetration further, Moody’s cautioned that some of the benefit to insurers may be offset by the loss of input tax credits now that GST is no longer levied .",

        "full_content": "L&T Finance's multi-year shift away from wholesale lending towards a predominantly retail portfolio is beginning to show clear financial gains, with NIMs plus fees rising 19 basis points sequentially to 10.41 percent in the latest quarter, driven by higher microfinance and rural loan disbursements, managing director and chief executive officer, Sudipta Roy told Moneycontrol in an interview.\nHe added that the loan book is now 98 percent retail, helping improve yield efficiency even as interest rates soften. At the same time, credit costs declined to 2.83 percent from 2.98 percent in the previous quarter, with the company guiding towards a further moderation to 2-2.2 percent by Q4FY27, signalling improving asset quality after last year’s microfinance stress.\nEdited excerpts:\nCan you explain how the loan book has evolved over the last few years?\nWe started with a loan book of around Rs 80,000–85,000 crore, with a roughly 50:50 mix between wholesale and retail. As we initiated our Lakshya programme, we started deleveraging our assets, we consciously reduced wholesale exposure. As a result, the overall book actually shrank for almost two years, around six to seven quarters.\nGrowth resumed around mid-2023, driven primarily by retail. Wholesale assets are bulky and low-yielding, they offer operating efficiency but not margin efficiency. Retail, on the other hand, delivers higher NIMs but is more manpower-intensive.\nAs wholesale assets tapered off and retail picked up, our NIMs and fees improved meaningfully. At peak, NIMs plus fees touched around 11.15 percent. They moderated subsequently but have started moving up again as microfinance disbursements revived. This quarter, NIMs and fees improved by about 19 basis points, which is a meaningful expansion.\nHow has retailisation impacted margins and credit costs?\nRetailisation has clearly helped margins. As higher-yielding businesses like microfinance, gold loans,  two-wheelers and personal loans gained traction, NIMs and fees moved up.\nOn credit costs, while there was a spike last year due to microfinance stress, that has now stabilised. Credit costs this quarter stood at 2.83 percent, down from 2.98 percent in the previous quarter (on a core basis). We expect credit costs to gradually trend down to around 2–2.2 percent by Q4 FY27.\nOverall, retailisation has led to higher margins, improving credit costs and better return metrics. Today, we are effectively a 98 percent retail-focused institution, and the remaining 2 percent will run down over the next couple of years.\nDespite RBI rate cuts, NIMs have risen from 8.24% in Q1 FY26 to 8.58 percent now. How did you manage this?\nWhen interest rates were rising earlier, we did not pass on rate hikes across most products, except home loans. Businesses like two-wheelers, tractors and microfinance have sufficient spreads and are not very sensitive to repo movements.\nNow that rates are coming down, we benefit because we don’t need to reduce rates in most segments. Only the mortgage book, about Rs 28,000 crore out of a total Rs 1.14 lakh crore, gets impacted. Even within that, only the home loan portion (65-70 percent) is rate-sensitive.\nThe recent improvement in NIMs is largely due to higher microfinance and rural business loan disbursements, which are our highest-yielding products.\nWhat is your guidance for NIMs plus fees for the year?\nWe have consistently guided that NIMs plus fees will remain in the 10-10.5 percent range. Depending on interest rate and cost pressures, it may move within that band, but we don’t expect it to fall below 10 percent in the medium term.\nGiven that we have navigated the microfinance challenges successfully, we see a good opportunity to grow this book, which should keep us closer to the upper end of the range.\nWhy did CRAR decline by about 1 percent quarter-on-quarter?\nThe decline is purely due to strong book growth, around 21 percent. We actually want leverage to increase. Debt/Equity(Average) has risen to 3.67, implying total leverage of around 4.67. As growth accelerates, capital naturally gets utilised.\nWhich segments drove disbursements in Q3?\nQ3 was significantly stronger than Q2. Two-wheeler disbursements rose to Rs 3,217 crore, while tractor disbursements jumped to Rs 2,783 crore from Rs 1,654 crore in Q2. Rural business finance, including microfinance, also performed well, with disbursements of about Rs 6,740 crore. Festive demand and rural recovery played a key role.\nWhat is the status of super bike loans?\nThis is a niche segment. We finance about 100-120 super bikes per month. These bikes are priced around Rs 20 lakh and are fully imported, so the market is limited. We don’t expect any major scale-up here, especially given rupee depreciation making imports more expensive.\nGold loan book grew 18 percent in Q3. What’s the outlook?\nGold loans should perform very well. We are opening one branch every day and expect to reach around 330 branches by Q4FY26. Around 64 new branches have already been rolled out. The impact of this expansion should start reflecting meaningfully from next quarter onwards.\nWhile we don’t give specific growth guidance, gold loans will contribute within our overall AUM growth guidance of 20–25 percent.\nHow have you managed to reduce borrowing costs?\nWe’ve actively optimised our borrowing mix. About 26 percent of our borrowings are PSL-linked, which are 1.25-1.5 percent lower than the normal cost. We have also prepaid certain expensive bank borrowings and replaced them with market instruments like NCDs, CPs, SIDBI loans and ECBs raised when conditions were favourable.\nAs a result, normal bank borrowings have reduced from 28 percent last year to 23 percent now. High-cost borrowings have been systematically replaced with lower-cost funds.\nHow do you see borrowing trends going forward, especially with expectations of rate cuts?\nBorrowing growth will track book growth. If the loan book grows at 20-22 percent, borrowings will rise in line with that. RBI’s liquidity measures have kept short-term rates soft, which helps us tap CP markets efficiently.\nOur ALM allows CP exposure of up to 15 percent, though we stay well within that. Overall, we remain comfortable with our borrowing mix and cost trajectory.",

        "full_content": "South Indian Bank has accelerated its shift towards higher-yielding retail and non-corporate assets, reducing short-term corporate lending and lengthening the tenor profile of its balance sheet, managing director and chief executive officer PR Seshadri told Moneycontrol in an interview.\nCorporate disbursements declined in the December quarter, as the bank moved away from short-duration loans that offer lower spreads. Extending asset tenors helps improve margins, even though it reduces liquidity from very short-term corporate assets, he said. Edited excerpts of the interview:\nThis has been another strong quarter on asset quality and profitability. What drove the Rs 374 crore profit?\nMultiple factors contributed to the performance. First, average assets grew at a healthy 11-12 percent year-on-year, which supported income growth. More importantly, the asset mix improved meaningfully. We saw strong growth in non-corporate businesses, which are higher yielding. As a result, net interest income rose 9 percent quarter-on-quarter between Q2 and Q3. This sequential improvement, rather than a year-on-year comparison, added significantly to revenues and flowed through to profitability.\nIn addition, we have been steadily re-architecting our balance sheet. Retail, MSME and gold loans now form a larger share of the book, helping revive net interest income. Margins expanded by 6 basis points (bps) quarter-on-quarter to 2.86 percent from 2.80 percent. Alongside this, stringent cost controls over the last two years ensured strong operating leverage, boosting profits.\nYou have been focusing more on higher-yielding assets. Is that why corporate disbursements fell sharply?\nYes, that is largely by design. We are consciously de-emphasising short-duration corporate assets and lengthening the tenor of our asset book. Earlier, we had a large proportion of very short-duration loans, which provided liquidity but came at lower spreads. By moving towards longer-duration assets, we earn better yields. This shift explains the decline in corporate disbursements and also supports margins over time.\nGold prices have risen in recent months. How did gold loan advances perform in the December quarter and what about LTVs?\nThe gold loan book grew strongly, rising about 26 percent year-on-year. We have implemented the new RBI guidelines on income-yielding gold loans, where permissible LTVs are slightly higher than the earlier 75 percent cap.\nWhile there has been some upward movement in LTVs, they remain well contained. The average portfolio LTV is around 65 percent, including portfolio purchases. For income-yielding, non-agriculture gold loans—where borrowers can demonstrate business cash flows, LTVs tend to be marginally higher, but overall risk remains well managed.\nLast year, gold loan growth was about 13 percent and you sounded cautious due to rising prices. How do you explain the 26 percent acceleration?\nThe acceleration reflects our improved preparedness. We built robust systems to leverage the new RBI policy and strengthened risk management frameworks. Gold prices have also shown relative stability at current levels.\nWe now use a value-at-risk framework to assess the impact of potential gold price movements on the portfolio based on historical trends. Based on these risk assessments, we were comfortable that risk levels were acceptable, which allowed us to accelerate growth in this segment.\nNRI deposits have grown consistently over the past few years but saw a modest sequential growth in Q3. Why?\nOn a year-on-year basis, NRI deposits have actually grown well, about 9 percent so far, and we are seeing strong momentum in account openings, CASA balances and overall volumes compared to last year.\nWith the rupee trading near 90 to the dollar, many NRIs see this as an attractive time to remit funds to India. We do not see this as a concern and expect growth to improve going forward.\nWhat is your outlook for NRI deposit growth?\nWe expect NRI deposit growth to move into double digits. In the near term, 12–13 percent growth is a reasonable expectation, and it could trend towards the mid-teens.\nHow does rupee depreciation impact NRI deposits?\nRupee depreciation generally encourages remittances into India. NRIs remit funds both for family needs and to build savings or a corpus in India. When exchange rates and interest rates are favourable, the latter category of remittances increases.\nAdditionally, rising geopolitical uncertainty often leads NRIs to park more funds in India. All these factors should support deposit growth in the 12–14 percent range.\nOn the liabilities side, how much of the RBI’s 125 bps rate cut has been transmitted and what is the impact on margins?\nWe transmit repo rate changes on a T+1 basis. So the December 25 bps cut was fully transmitted the next day. However, since it came mid-month, the impact on margins in the quarter reflects less than a full month.\nIn the current quarter, we will see the full impact of the 25 bps cut. That said, a large portion of our deposits are also being repriced during the quarter, which will partially offset the margin impact. Overall, we expect the impact on margins to be only a fraction of the repo cut.\nIf there is another rate cut in February, that impact is not factored in yet, but we do not expect a material hit to revenues.",

        "full_content": "India's gross market borrowing for the financial year 2026-27 is expected to rise to Rs 15–17 lakh crore due a sharp surge in redemptions even as the government stays committed to fiscal consolidation while focusing on debt sustainability,  a Moneycontrol pre-Budget poll has found.\nNet borrowing is estimated in the range of Rs 10.5–14 lakh crore, with most market participants expecting the fiscal deficit to be contained around 4.3–4.4 percent of GDP in FY27. Economists, treasury heads and money market experts participated in the poll.\nThe government budgeted Rs 14.82 lakh crore as gross borrowing for FY26, higher than the Rs 14.01 lakh crore the previous year.\nGovernment borrowings are among the most important determinants of interest rates in the economy. Higher-than-expected borrowings can push up rates for all bond issuers — sovereign and corporate —  while interest rates can decline if it tightens its belt and borrows less than anticipated.\nBorrowings are loans taken by the government to fund its spending on public services. Usually, the government borrows the money through securities such as government securities and treasury bills.\nGovernment borrowing expectations\nRedemptions to drive higher gross supply\nThe increase is largely being driven by higher bond maturities, estimated at Rs 5.47 lakh crore in FY27, compared with about Rs 3.3 lakh crore in FY26. This will push up headline borrowing numbers even if the deficit ratio continues to decline.\n“Redemptions are expected to surge in FY27, which will mechanically push gross market issuances higher,” said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA, who estimates gross borrowing at around Rs 16.9 lakh crore, with net issuances of about Rs 12.2 trillion.\nFiscal consolidation remains intact\nDespite higher supply, market participants do not see any major deviation from the fiscal glide path. The government is expected to rely on nominal GDP growth, steady tax buoyancy and non-tax revenues to keep borrowing in check.\nMataprasad Pandey, vice-president at Arete Capital Service, said the lower end of borrowing estimates reflects the government’s “continued emphasis on fiscal consolidation” and the potential support from India’s inclusion in the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index, which could ease borrowing pressures.\nAt the same time, risks remain. Pandey said “weaker indirect tax collections following GST rate cuts” could push borrowing higher if the weakness persists into FY27.\nNet borrowing seen manageable\nNet borrowing is expected to remain broadly stable, clustered around Rs 11-12.5 lakh crore, supported by steady demand from domestic institutional investors and incremental foreign inflows.\nBalasubramanian R, head of treasury at Dhanlaxmi Bank, said net supply of around Rs 10.5 lakh crore is “manageable for the market”, with pension funds and foreign portfolio inflows aiding absorption.\nBorrowing strategy: maturity mix in focus\nThe government is expected to avoid a heavy tilt towards ultra-long bonds, given limited appetite for duration. Issuance is likely to remain balanced across short- and long-term maturities, with tactical use of treasury bills and selective long-tenor bonds to meet investor demand.\n“There is no expectation of a sharp increase in long-term borrowings; the mix is likely to remain broadly similar,” said Alok Singh, group head of treasury at CSB Bank.\nSome expect the government to rationalise issuances beyond 15 years to contain borrowing costs amid elevated spreads.\nGreen bonds to stay limited\nSovereign green bonds are likely to remain part of the borrowing programme but without any meaningful increase in issuance due to the absence of a green premium.\n“Despite the absence of a greenium for sovereign green bonds, the government is likely to include them in its borrowing programme,” Pandey said, adding issuance levels are unlikely to rise.\nEstimates for green bond issuance range from Rs 20,000-25,000 crore, or around 5 percent of the total borrowing.\n“Green bond around 5 percent of the issuance,” said Gopal Tripathi, head of treasury at Jana Small Finance Bank.\nShift towards debt-to-GDP anchor\nA broader shift in the fiscal framework is also underway, with policymakers placing greater emphasis on debt-to-GDP metrics alongside annual deficit targets.\n“There is a clear shift from focusing only on the fiscal deficit to managing the debt-to-GDP ratio,” said Umesh Kumar Tulsyan, managing director at Sovereign Global Markets, DDING the Centre aims to gradually bring down its debt ratio towards 50 percent over the medium term.",

        "full_content": "As India prepares for the Union Budget 2026, housing finance institutions are looking beyond incremental measures to structural reforms that can meaningfully improve housing affordability and expand homeownership. With urbanisation accelerating, household aspirations evolving and first-time buyers entering the market in larger numbers, the Budget presents an opportunity to recalibrate policy levers in line with today’s economic realities.\nAffordability is the key\nAffordability remains the single most critical factor shaping home-buying decisions. While interest rates, income growth and supply dynamics play a role, fiscal and regulatory support continue to be decisive enablers, particularly for the affordable and mid-income housing segments.\nFrom a housing finance perspective, the focus this year must shift to modernising definitions, deepening access to credit and strengthening last-mile execution.\nRevisiting the definition of affordable housing\nOne of the most pressing structural gaps today lies in the definition of affordable housing itself. The current property value threshold of Rs 45 lakh no longer reflects market realities. Over the past few years, land prices, construction costs, regulatory compliance expenses and input inflation have increased significantly, especially across Tier 1 cities and rapidly growing Tier 2 hubs. As a result, even modest, end-user homes often fall outside the existing affordability bracket.\nIncreasing the affordable housing limit from Rs 45 lakh to Rs 75 lakh would be a logical and market-aligned reform. This change would not dilute the intent of affordable housing; rather, it would modernise it. A revised threshold would allow policy benefits to reach genuine middle-income and first-time buyers who are currently excluded despite facing affordability constraints. For housing finance institutions, such a move would also create greater clarity in product design and eligibility, enabling more targeted lending without encouraging speculative demand.\nStrengthening tax incentives for home buyers\nTax benefits have historically played a catalytic role in encouraging home ownership. While existing deductions on home loan interest and principal repayment have provided relief, there is scope to enhance their effectiveness. A higher interest deduction limit for self-occupied homes, especially for first-time buyers, could improve monthly affordability and purchasing confidence.\nEqually important is continuity and clarity. Stable, long-term tax incentives allow buyers to plan better and lenders to design products with greater certainty. From a sector standpoint, predictable policy signals are far more effective than short-term stimulus.\nLowering the cost of credit and expanding access\nAccess to affordable credit is central to boosting housing demand. Housing finance companies and banks have significantly strengthened their underwriting, risk management and digital capabilities over the past few years. Budgetary support that enables further reduction in the cost of funds, whether through targeted refinancing windows, partial credit enhancement mechanisms or expanded priority sector allocations can help lenders pass on benefits to borrowers.\nFor underserved segments, especially informal income households and self-employed borrowers, policy-backed risk-sharing co-lending partnerships can unlock credit flow without compromising asset quality. This is particularly relevant in Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets, where demand is strong, but formal credit penetration remains uneven.\nAccelerating supply-side execution\nAffordability is as much about supply as it is about demand. Faster project approvals, rationalisation of GST on under-construction properties and incentives for developers focused on mass housing can improve supply efficiency and pricing discipline. A coordinated push to streamline approvals at the state and local levels would reduce project timelines, lower financing costs and ultimately benefit home buyers.\nIn parallel, continued investment in urban infrastructure such as transport, water, sanitation and connectivity enhances the liveability and value of affordable housing projects, making them more attractive to end-users.\nA long-term vision for housing-led growth\nHousing has always been a long-gestation sector, but affordability cannot wait. Union Budget 2026 could reset the housing narrative by aligning policy with today’s price realities and evolving buyer profiles. Affordability today is about relevance, not relief, and if the focus shifts to execution-led reforms rather than incremental tweaks, housing can once again emerge as a reliable driver of economic momentum while turning home ownership from a stretched aspiration into a practical, confident decision.\n(Mehernosh Tata is MD & CEO, Godrej Housing Finance.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "The National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO) has recommended the Union Ministry of Finance a slew of measures for the upcoming Union budget such as setting a higher limit for interest deduction on home loans and reinstatement of the Income Tax Settlement Commission.\n\"The limit for interest deduction on home loans should be raised from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh or more for owner occupied houses. Also, five years period for acquisition or completion from the year of borrowing should be dispensed with,\" NAREDCO said in its recommendations to the Union Ministry of Finance on January 22.\nCurrently, under Section 24(b) of IT Act 1961 (Section 22 of IT Act 2025), deduction on account of interest payment on housing loans is permissible to owners of rented dwelling units to the fullest extent. In case of owner-occupied houses, the limit is set at Rs 2 lakh.\nParveen Jain, President, NAREDCO, said that rationalising taxation, especially on housing finance, will directly stimulate end-user demand.\n“The move will provide much-needed impetus to a sector grappling with a significant housing shortage and offer relief to homebuyers impacted by project delays arising from cash flow constraints, while restoring overall buyer confidence,” he said.\nNAREDCO has also suggested the reinstatement of the Income-tax Settlement Commission. The commission established in 1976 to provide taxpayers a one-time opportunity to enter into a compromise and settlement arrangement with the Income-tax Authority to grant them relief from penalties and prosecution, was discontinued with effective from February 1, 2021.\n\"Restoring and strengthening dispute resolution mechanisms like the Income-tax Settlement Commission is critical for fostering a transparent, investor-friendly environment in the real estate sector. Coupled with rationalized taxation policies, these reforms will catalyse sustainable growth, boost housing affordability,\" said, Niranjan Hiranandani, Chairman, NAREDCO.\nThe recommendations gain significance as the real estate sector comprises about 7-8 percent of India's GDP and is the second largest employer after agriculture with about 19 percent of the country's total workforce.\nThe developers’ body also recommended that entities engaged in real estate business should be exempted from the burden of tax on notional rental income, as there is a need to incentivise rental housing in India.",

Buyers are not just looking at square footage—they want experience-led living and environments that enhance overall quality of life,” he said.\nYamini Agarwal, CMO, Nimbus Realty, lifestyle-oriented homes are no longer limited to luxury buyers.\n“We are seeing strong interest even from end-users upgrading from mid-segment housing. They want larger homes, better air quality, open spaces, and a sense of community. Projects that integrate lifestyle and sustainability from the planning stage are seeing better absorption and stronger buyer confidence,” she said.\nSustainability moves from optional to essential\nMarket observers say sustainability is fast becoming a core driver of residential demand, propelled by rising awareness of climate risk, higher utility costs and a desire for healthier living spaces.\nAccording to a report by Carbon Guardians, a sustainability-focused real estate solutions firm, India’s green building market is projected to grow to nearly $85 billion by 2032.\n“Developers who embed sustainable features at the planning stage such as rainwater harvesting, solar integration, waste-management systems, and low-carbon materials are seeing better traction in the market,” Gaur added.\nGautam Kanodia, Founder, KREEVA and Kanodia Group, said energy-efficient and ESG-aligned homes are attracting not only lifestyle buyers but also institutional interest, as sustainable design becomes an increasingly important metric for long-term value and investment quality.\n“Sustainability and lifestyle aren’t just buzzwords, they’re becoming core decision filters for buyers. Future-ready homes with strong ESG credentials are likely to outperform in both absorption and resale value in 2026,” he said.\nBranded housing to lead growth\nThe Colliers report also points to broader market trends supporting lifestyle and sustainability-led demand.\nDevelopers are responding by launching branded and experience-oriented projects that combine premium lifestyle amenities with strong design and sustainability measures, targeting buyers who value comfort, long-term income potential and quality of life.\nAgarwal said the evolving buyer base in 2026 includes affluent end-users and dual-income families seeking wellness-oriented environments, professionals prioritising work-life balance and community living, NRIs and investors focused on sustainability and branded housing promising capital preservation.\n“Compared to a few years ago, buyers are now as concerned about where they live and how they live as much as what they pay,” she said.",

        "full_content": "As India gears up for the Union Budget 2026, the real estate sector once again finds itself at the crossroads, linking\npolicy, capital, and long-term urban transformation. The sector is rarely the loudest sector in fiscal debates, yet it remains one of the most deeply intertwined with how the economy functions and how cities take shape.  In that sense, real estate is less a standalone industry and more a connective tissue linking policy intent with lived reality.\nDemand has showed surprising resilience\nOver the past two years, the sector has shown a degree of resilience that few anticipated in the aftermath of global uncertainty and domestic recalibration.\nDemand has held steady across housing segments, with premium and luxury markets continuing to find depth among buyers who value stability, quality, and long-term asset security.\nMaturing ecosystem has helped\nThis sustained momentum has not been accidental. It reflects a period of regulatory maturity, improved governance, and a cautious rebuilding of trust between developers and homebuyers. The forthcoming budget therefore presents an opportunity to reinforce stability, improve affordability, and sustain the growth trajectory that the sector has carefully built over the past few years.\nSustaining housing and urban development\nAt the centre of industry expectations lies continuity. Long-term housing and urban development programmes work best when predictable, allowing developers, investors, and state agencies to plan with clarity. Consistency in flagship initiatives related to housing, infrastructure, and urban rejuvenation supports better project planning and steady employment across construction and allied industries.\nReal estate’s multiplier effect—spanning cement, steel, logistics, interiors, and services—means sustained government backing has a ripple impact beyond the sector. A budget that reinforces continuity in these programmes would help maintain execution momentum and contribute to organised urban expansion.\nInfrastructure-equivalent status will unlock patient capital\nGranting housing “infrastructure-equivalent” status, along with tax rebates and incentives, would improve access to patient, long-tenure capital at lower financing costs. A stable policy framework would further enable developers, customers, and investors to structure funding and commit capital with confidence over the long term.\nEnhancing affordability through market-aligned incentives\nAffordability, however, remains the most delicate lever. Budgetary measures that enhance home-buying benefits, whether through interest-linked incentives or tax-related support, can meaningfully improve buyer confidence.\nImportantly, aligning housing incentives with current market realities would ensure that policy benefits remain relevant to today’s homebuyers rather than being constrained by outdated benchmarks. Such alignment can help bridge the gap between aspiration and access, particularly for first-time buyers.\nFurthermore, revision of affordable housing price capped at Rs 45 lakh is another key area that demands attention. Urban land and construction costs have evolved significantly over the past decade, and revisiting price thresholds to reflect present-day realities would allow more genuine end-users to qualify for benefits. For developers, this could encourage fresh project launches within the affordable and mid-income segments, improving supply where demand is structurally strong. A more contemporary definition of affordability would therefore support both homeownership and housing creation.\nGST rationalisation to ease cost pressures\nTaxation, particularly around construction inputs, continues to shape project viability in subtle but significant ways. Streamlining GST on construction-related items can help reduce cost pressures across the value chain, improve developer cash flows, and support timely project delivery. Over time, these efficiencies can lead to more competitive pricing for buyers while strengthening the financial health of projects. A simpler, more balanced tax framework would reinforce the sector’s ability to deliver at scale without compromising on quality or timelines.\nA budget that builds for the future\nWhat distinguishes the real estate sector today from its earlier cycles is its growing institutional character. Regulatory oversight has improved transparency, technology has reshaped transactions, and buyers are more informed than ever. From RERA-compliant disclosures to digital transaction platforms, the industry has embraced transformation. The upcoming budget can strengthen this evolution with progressive policy measures that focus on affordability, rationalisation and stability, while recognizing evolved market conditions and staying true to the vision of housing for all.\n(Vijay Wadhwa, Chairman, The Wadhwa Group.)\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "After sharp price gains across top cities for the past two years, India’s residential property market is entering 2026 with prices expected to stabilise, though the risk of a slowdown in select markets remains.\nHome prices rose at their fastest pace in years through 2025 because of strong end-user demand, tight inventory in prime micro-markets, rising construction and land costs, and sustained appetite for premium and luxury housing.\nIndustry experts said 2026 is unlikely to see a repeat of last year’s sharp price escalation. Instead, the market is expected to transition into a phase of calibrated growth, with pricing becoming increasingly micro-market and segment specific.\nThey said property price growth is expected to moderate after sharp gains across major cities such as Noida, Gurugram, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune in previous years.\nResidential sales, which rebounded sharply after the pandemic, have moderated in recent quarters alongside a weaker domestic equity market. Real estate developer Signature Global (India) Ltd earlier this month said it might not meet its sales guidance for the current fiscal, citing softer demand conditions.\nAnalysts said that the slowdown is expected to extend to other listed developers as well. Nomura Securities projects a 92 percent fall in DLF’s pre-sales and a 43 percent decline for Oberoi Realty. Analysts said that housing demand in Gurugram and Noida could soften amid elevated prices and a slowdown in new project launches.\nFrom momentum to moderation\nAccording to the CREDAI-CREMatrix Developer Sentiment Survey 2026, most developers expect residential prices to either stabilise or grow at a slower pace this year, with demand holding firm but becoming more value-conscious. The survey also points towards a moderation in property price hikes rather than more cautious buyer behaviour.\n“The market has absorbed a lot of price increase over the last 18–24 months. In 2026, buyers are more discerning. They are still willing to pay a premium—but only for the right location, connectivity and product quality. We are clearly seeing a shift from aggressive pricing to strategic pricing,” said Sandeep Chhillar, Founder & Chairman, Landmark Group.\nCity-wise divergence emerging\nCity wise trends point to divergence rather than a uniform slowdown. Market observers said that Delhi-NCR remains one of the strongest markets, driven by infrastructure projects such as the Dwarka Expressway, Noida International Airport and metro expansions.\nHowever, affordability pressures are beginning to temper demand in peripheral micro-markets where prices have risen faster than income growth.\nSehaj Chawla, Managing Director, TREVOC Group said that demand remains resilient in well-connected corridors where infrastructure delivery is clearly visible.\n“Across NCR and other metros, price appreciation in 2026 is expected to become more calibrated. Projects at well-connected locations will attract greater traction,” he added.\nMumbai continues to see resilience in premium and redevelopment-led supply, though mid-segment buyers are increasingly price-sensitive. Experts said that Bengaluru and Hyderabad are witnessing steady absorption, supported by technology-sector employment, but price growth is expected to moderate as new supply comes on stream. Pune and Chennai are likely to remain end-user-driven, with limited speculative activity, they said.\nDevelopers recalibrate strategies\nMarket observers said that developers are recalibrating strategies in 2026 due to slow momentum.\nAmit Modi, Director, County Group, said that affordability has become a key conversation again, so instead of chasing headline price hikes, developers are focusing on optimising unit sizes, introducing flexible payment plans, and phasing launches to align with demand absorption.\n“Developers are responding by fine-tuning product mix, more efficient homes, fewer speculative launches, and sharper pricing discipline. The objective is volume-led growth rather than aggressive appreciation,” he added.\nCREDAI-CRE Matrix survey echoes this trend, indicating that developers are prioritising execution and cash-flow visibility over rapid expansion. New launches are increasingly concentrated in established micro-markets with proven demand rather than peripheral locations.\nStability over slowdown\nIndustry watchers anticipate that 2026 will test the market’s ability to sustain demand without relying solely on price momentum. Interest rates are expected to remain largely stable, supporting housing demand, but affordability constraints will cap sharp upside.\nChawla of TREVOC Group said the next phase of growth would be driven less by speculation and more by fundamentals. “Markets with infrastructure, employment visibility and quality supply will continue to perform,” he said.",

        "full_content": "Ahead of the Union Budget, real estate stakeholders have called for tax reforms and greater government funding, particularly through the expansion of Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing (SWAMIH) Fund.\nTargeted fiscal measures are critical to sustaining housing demand, reviving stalled projects and aligning policy with current market realities, industry leaders have said.\nIndustry body the National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO) has stressed for the need for deeper financial support to unlock real estate-led growth through schemes such as SWAMIH Fund.\nIndustry stakeholders also highlighted the need to increase the home loan interest deduction limit from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. Additional interest subsidies and reduction in GST would provide a much-needed boost to affordable housing, they said.\nSWAMIH Fund expansion\nLaunched in 2019 with an initial corpus of Rs 25,000 crore, the SWAMIH Fund was created to provide last-mile financing to stalled residential projects and protect homebuyers stuck in delayed developments.\nSince inception, SWAMIH Fund-I has sanctioned investments in over 130 stalled projects across India, helping revive nearly one lakh housing units, according to government disclosures. Of these, tens of thousands of homes have already been completed and delivered in stressed markets such as NCR, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune.\n“We urge the government to accord infrastructure status to the real estate sector, extend and expand the SWAMIH Fund, improve credit access for developers, rationalise GST on under-construction housing, and provide incentives for first-time homebuyers and rental housing,” NAREDCO president Parveen Jain.\nHe added that sustained investment in urban infrastructure and a sharper focus on tier 2 and 3 cities could significantly enhance demand, buyer confidence and the sector’s contribution to GDP and employment.\nTax reforms key to affordability and ‘Housing for All’\nTax policy reforms are another major expectation from the upcoming budget, especially as affordability pressures intensify in urban markets.\nAnita Basrur, Partner at Sudit K Parekh and Co. LLP, said the government’s “Housing for All” vision under schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) requires urgent recalibration of tax thresholds.\n“With inflation, land prices and construction costs rising, the current affordable housing cap of Rs 45 lakh and size limits of 60–90 square metres no longer reflect urban realities,” Basrur said.\nShe called for reducing GST on housing projects, increasing the home loan interest deduction limit from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, and offering interest subsidies for first-time buyers.\nBasrur also suggested enhancing capital gains reinvestment limits and streamlining approvals through a single-window clearance mechanism to boost the sector.\nPolicy Push\nDevelopers, particularly in the premium and branded housing segments, are seeking consistency in taxation and improved access to institutional financing to sustain investor confidence.\n“The real estate sector eagerly anticipates policies that bolster long-term capital formation and reinforce housing’s pivotal role in economic growth,” said Anil Mittal, chief financial officer, Smartworld Developers.\nContinued investment in urban infrastructure, mass mobility and integrated city planning is critical, as improved connectivity and civic amenities directly enhance the appeal of residential developments.\nIndia Sotheby’s International Realty managing director Amit Goyal said for the housing momentum to sustain, buoyancy in the equity markets and foreign capital inflows must remain buoyant. “It is imperative for the budget to announce measures that will encourage more FDI (foreign direct investments) into the country,” he said.\nManish Agarwal, Managing Director (Satya Group) and President, CREDAI Haryana, said that as the Budget approaches, developers urge the government to introduce forward-looking policy interventions that pair exclusivity with financial agility.\n\"In particular, incentivising fractional ownership could be a gamechanger for the marquee asset class. By aligning fiscal policy with these evolving market dynamics, India can move beyond property development to build a resilient, world-class luxury ecosystem that competes effectively on the global stage,\" he said.",

        "full_content": "India’s subdued equity markets and volatile investor sentiment are beginning to weigh on the country’s real estate sector, particularly in the mid-income and premium-housing segments, as developers report slower sales momentum and cautious buyer behaviour.\nAfter a strong post-pandemic recovery, residential sales have shown signs of moderation in recent quarters, mirroring the lacklustre performance of domestic stock markets. Market observers say prolonged volatility in equities, limited wealth creation and a wait-and-watch approach among investors have dampened discretionary property purchases, especially from high-value and investor-driven segments.\nThe impact is becoming visible in developer guidance. Signature Global (India) Ltd, a key player in the mid-income and premium housing segment, earlier this month indicated that it might not be able to meet its sales guidance for the current fiscal, citing softer demand conditions.\nAnalysts have viewed the company’s commentary as an early signal of broader stress in parts of the residential market. They say housing demand in Gurugram could soften amid elevated prices and a slowdown in new project launches.\nThe trend is not limited to Signature Global as other major listed developers such as DLF and Oberoi Realty, are also expected to report weaker pre-sales. Nomura Securities, in its latest note, projects a steep 92 percent drop in pre-sales for DLF, while Oberoi Realty is estimated to see a 43 percent decline.\n“Real estate demand in urban markets is closely linked to financial market sentiment. When equity markets underperform or remain range-bound, buyers tend to defer large-ticket purchases like homes,” a Delhi-NCR-based real estate consultant said on condition of anonymity.\nNuvama Institutional Equities said the frenzy that has characterised the Gurugram market over the past few years is now ebbing. The brokerage expects a rationalisation in new launches, pre‑sales momentum and the pace of price appreciation in the city going forward.\nInvestor-led demand weakens\nIndustry experts note that while end-user demand remains relatively stable, especially in affordable housing, investor-led demand has weakened amid uncertain capital market returns. High interest rates, elevated property prices in key urban centres and muted income growth have further added to buyer caution.\n“Stock market performance plays a significant role in driving confidence, particularly among repeat buyers and investors. With limited upside in equities, capital allocation to real estate has slowed,” an analyst with a real estate advisory firm said.\nThe slowdown is more pronounced in markets such as Gurugram where prices have risen sharply over the past two to three years, making affordability a growing concern. Developers are increasingly relying on festive offers, flexible payment plans and selective price corrections to sustain sales velocity.\nHowever, the impact has not been uniform across the sector. Prime housing in select micro-markets and well-located affordable projects continues to see steady traction, driven by genuine end-users. Commercial real estate, particularly office leasing, has also remained resilient, offering some cushion to developers with diversified portfolios.\nWill property prices go down?\nMarket observers said immediate outright price cut would not be happening, however, builders might start recalibrating their strategies to align with current demand realities.\n“Outright price cuts remain unlikely as elevated construction and land costs limit the scope for base price reductions. Instead, developers are relying on payment flexibility, limited-period incentives, and stamp-duty support to help buyer conversions,” said, Ashish Narain Agarwal, Founder and MD of PropertyPistol, a Mumbai-based real estate consultancy firm.\nHe said in more affordability-stretched micro-markets, launches are being deferred and sales targets moderated by developers as part of their strategies to tackle the situation.\n“Many developers are focusing on phased launches and sell-through efficiency, rather than chasing volumes,” Agarwal said.\nOutlook\nIndustry stakeholders believe that a revival in equity markets, coupled with softer interest rates and policy support, will be crucial to restoring buyer confidence. Until then, developers may need to recalibrate growth expectations and focus on execution and balance-sheet strength rather than aggressive sales targets.",

        "full_content": "Gurugram emerged as one of India’s biggest magnets for real estate investment in 2025, with projects worth Rs 86,588 crore receiving regulatory approvals during the year, according to Gurugram Real Estate Regulatory Authority (Gurugram RERA).\nMarket observers said that these estimates underscore strong investor appetite for the NCR’s largest commercial and residential hub.\nData released by the Gurugram RERA shows that 131 projects were registered in calendar year 2025, translating into development potential of 35,455 units across housing and commercial segments.\nNotably, just 28 large projects accounted for investments of Rs 59,360 crore, highlighting the growing role of big-ticket capital and large developers in shaping the city’s real estate landscape, the Authority data showed.\nData showed that the residential assets continued to attract the bulk of investments. Of the total units approved, 31,455 were residential, reflecting sustained end-user demand as well as investor confidence in Gurugram’s long-term housing fundamentals.\n“The residential mix was spread across categories, with 17,405 group housing units, 5,720 mixed land use units, 4,040 residential floor units, 2,122 affordable group housing units, 1,954 units under the Deen Dayal housing scheme, and 214 residential plotted colony units,” the Authority data showed.\nMarket observers said this diversified pipeline indicates that capital is being deployed across both premium and mass segments, reducing concentration risk and improving the depth of the market.\nAuthority officials said that of the 4,000 commercial units approved during the year, 168 units were dedicated to IT parks, reinforcing Gurugram’s status as a preferred destination for technology firms and Global Capability Centres.\nAnalysts said the combination of office-led employment growth and residential development continues to make Gurugram attractive for long-term capital deployment.\nIndustry experts said that the scale of investments approved in 2025 reflects Gurugram’s ability to attract capital even amid global uncertainty, driven by infrastructure expansion, strong corporate presence, and a more robust regulatory framework.\n“With a large pipeline of approved projects and continued interest from developers and institutional investors, Gurugram is expected to remain a key investment destination within India’s real estate market in the coming years,” a Gurugram-based real estate expert said.\nTighter regulatory checks\nAuthority officials said that alongside rising investment volumes, Gurugram RERA implemented tighter regulatory checks to improve transparency and protect investor and homebuyer interests.\n“These steps included enhanced scrutiny of developer submissions, mandatory site inspections by domain experts, and the introduction of public consultation through mandatory public notices before project registration,” an official said.\nAmlan Dutta, VP Sales and Strategy, Trehan Iris, said, that Gurugram’s clearance of 131 projects in 2025 marks a remarkable momentum for the sector, reflecting strong investor confidence and a renewed sense of market optimism.\n“RERA’s transparent and well-structured framework has played a pivotal role in driving this growth by empowering developers with greater planning certainty, smoother access to capital and the confidence to deliver high-quality projects on time. By promoting accountability and minimizing ambiguity, RERA safeguards buyer interests while simultaneously enhancing developer credibility,” he said.\nSudeep Bhatt, Director Strategy, Whiteland Corporation, said that regulatory reforms under RERA have been a key stimulus, bringing in greater transparency through strict compliance norms, mandatory site inspections and continuous project monitoring.\n“This has strengthened trust among HNIs and NRIs, leading to growing NRI participation and rising Indian global clout in real estate investments,” he said.",

        "full_content": "In 2025, India’s real estate market will be remembered for extremes. Luxury apartments are selling fast, premium prices are easily absorbed, and developers’ balance sheets are stronger than ever. However, beneath this success lies a troubling contradiction: affordable housing—the backbone of urban India—is quietly disappearing. This isn’t a demand crisis but a crisis rooted in economics, policy design, and misaligned incentives.\nA Vanishing Segment\nRecent market data paints a stark picture. Knight Frank India reports that the supply-to-demand ratio for homes priced below ₹50 lakhs has collapsed to 0.36 in the first half of 2025, down from a balanced 1.05 in 2019. In simpler terms, for every 100 affordable homes demanded, only 36 are being supplied.\nThe shift in developer focus is dramatic. Affordable housing accounted for over half of new residential launches in 2018; today, it represents just 17%. Sales in this segment have dropped nearly 17% year-on-year, even as luxury housing records its fastest-ever absorption rates. The paradox is evident: premium projects are selling quickly, yet unsold high-ticket inventory piles up. Meanwhile, lower- and middle-income households find homeownership increasingly unattainable. The market is oversupplying where demand is limited and undersupplying where it is structurally deep.\nWhy Developers Are Walking Away\nThe lack of affordable housing supply isn’t due to a lack of intent by developers. It’s primarily driven by razor-thin margins and unviable economics. Rising construction costs—cement, steel, labour, compliance, and most notably, urban land prices—have outpaced the growth of lower-income household incomes. Affordable housing, by definition, operates on tight margins, whereas luxury housing doesn’t.\nFor developers, the decision is clear: premium projects offer larger margins and pricing flexibility. In contrast, even small cost increases in affordable housing can wipe out profitability. Geography further complicates matters. Affordable land is usually available on city peripheries, but these areas often lack sufficient transport, social infrastructure, and employment opportunities. Consequently, developers find it difficult to make projects financially viable—either land in the city is too expensive, or peripheral areas are too disconnected.\nThe Illusion of Affordability\nThere’s a growing narrative that housing affordability has improved. Mumbai’s EMI-to-income ratio, for example, has dropped below 50%, now sitting at around 47%. This decline is attributed to lower interest rates and stable income growth. But this statistic hides the true barrier to homeownership for lower-middle-income households. The real challenge isn’t just the monthly EMI but the high upfront costs—down payments, stamp duty, registration charges, and rising property prices—making homeownership increasingly out of reach.\nMoreover, a significant portion of the affordable housing target audience is self-employed or earns informal income. Traditional banking requirements, such as salary slips, formal credit histories, and tax returns, exclude many genuine buyers from institutional financing. So, while demand exists, access does not.\nThe Policy Mismatch\nAt the heart of the issue lies a disconnect between policy intentions and market realities. The government’s commitment to “Housing for All” remains clear, and initiatives such as PMAY 2.0 reflect that vision. However, the frameworks governing taxation and incentives have not evolved to match rising costs.\nTake the current GST regime: residential housing is split into two categories—“affordable” projects taxed at 1% and all others taxed at 5%. To qualify as affordable, a home must cost less than ₹45 lakhs and meet strict size limits. These thresholds were set in 2017, and in 2026, they are outdated. Industry bodies, such as CREDAI, have proposed raising the affordability threshold to ₹90 lakhs, which would reflect current land and construction costs. Additionally, the legal definition of “affordable” should reflect the distinct price and cost dynamics between rural and urban areas.\nThe Hidden Tax Burden\nA major issue within the existing framework is that residential real estate developers cannot claim input tax credits, unlike other industries. Although GST on cement and tiles has been reduced, developers can’t offset these taxes against the GST collected from buyers. As a result, the 1% tax rate on affordable housing doesn’t account for input taxes embedded in construction costs, leading to a cascading tax effect. This hidden tax burden inflates prices, undermining the very goal of affordable housing. Allowing input tax credits for affordable projects or reducing GST on works contracts would directly reduce construction costs and make housing more affordable.\nThe Case for Direct Tax Incentives\nTo level the playing field, income tax incentives are essential. The reintroduction of Section 80-IBA of the Income Tax Act, which previously offered a 100% tax holiday on profits from affordable housing projects, could boost supply once again. However, the section had limitations, including a project life cap of five years, which is too short for the nature of the industry.\nTo revitalise affordable housing, Section 80-IBA could be revamped by:\nAdditionally, the ₹2 lakh cap on home loan interest deductions has become outdated. Raising this cap to ₹5 lakhs would offer immediate relief to families struggling with high EMIs.\nFurther, employers could be incentivised to build industrial and employee housing through higher depreciation allowances on employee residences. This would address migrant housing shortages while reducing pressure on urban slums.\nThe Role of States and Cities\nState governments and local authorities hold significant power to promote affordable housing through stamp duty and registration charge reductions. Currently, these high charges act as an additional burden on lower- and middle-income households. By reducing these rates for affordable housing projects, immediate relief could be provided.\nA responsive regulatory environment that speeds up approvals and reduces red tape can also make projects more viable. Urban development policy should align private and public interests, for example, by offering higher Floor Space Index (FSI) in prime locations for affordable housing projects.\nLooking Beyond Housing\nAffordable housing can’t be solved in isolation. Urban congestion, job concentration, and land scarcity are interconnected challenges. Long-term strategies must include economic decentralisation, satellite city development, and employment-linked housing incentives.\nConclusion\nLand is finite, and housing demand is perpetual. The affordable housing crisis is not inevitable. It’s a result of outdated definitions, mismatched policies, and tax distortions. By recalibrating what “affordable” truly means in 2026 and addressing the fiscal paradox developers face, India can restore balance to its housing market. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of “Housing for All” can once again become a reality, both socially and commercially, with the right structural reforms.\n(Deepesh Chheda is Partner, Dhruva Advisors.)\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",

        "full_content": "Noida, once known for offering affordable housing for the salaried middle class in the National Capital Region (NCR), is now becoming a hub for high-end residential developments, including branded residences by top hospitality, lifestyle and luxury brands.\nDriven by expanding job opportunities, infrastructure growth, rising wealth, and evolving buyer aspirations, the city is swiftly developing into a luxury and branded-residence destination, attracting high-net-worth individuals (HNIs), non-resident Indians (NRIs) and entrepreneurial buyers who once focused primarily on Mumbai, Delhi and Gurugram.\nBranded residences take centre stage\nNoida has seen a string of branded residences by Gulshan Group, M3M India and Smartworld Developers. In October 2025, M3M India collaborated with global luxury jewellery and watches brand Jacob & Co. to launch M3M-Jacob & Co Residences.\nSimilarly, in December, the Indian Hotels Company Ltd (IHCL), the owner of Taj Hotels, has collaborated with Noida-based realty firm Gulshan Group to develop a Taj hotel and Taj Branded Serviced Apartments in Noida’s Sector 129 along the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway.\nAlso Read: From Trump Towers to Jacob & Co, branded residences lead India’s luxury housing wave\nJoining the league of branded residences, Smartworld Developers has collaborated with Lebanon-based fashion designer and lifestyle brand, Elie Saab, for another branded residence project in Sector 98 in Noida. Besides these, M3M India is also planning to launch Trump-branded residences in Noida.\nThe apartments in these branded residences in Noida typically range from Rs 9 crore to Rs 25 crore, depending on their size, location, and the brand.\nWho are the buyers?\nMarket observers said that these high-end property launches mark a departure from Noida’s traditional product mix, where housing was largely driven by mid-income segments. Developers are now focusing on differentiated offerings tailored to luxury, lifestyle and brand-conscious buyers.\nDevelopers and market analysts said that the primary buyers of Noida’s luxury and branded residences include HNIs, NRIs, corporates, entrepreneurs from tier-1 and 2 cities, and some celebrities.\nYukti Nagpal, Director, Gulshan Group, said that buyers of high-end apartments are CXO-level professionals, entrepreneurs, and NRIs seeking space, comfort, and long-term value.\n“Compared to Mumbai, Delhi, or Gurugram, Noida still offers larger homes and better value, which is increasingly influencing premium homebuyer decisions,” she said.\nPankaj Bansal, the owner of M3M India and founder of Smartworld Developers, said buyers are largely people who have arrived in their lives and want their presence to be felt.\n“Either these people have a lot of money, or they are famous in the area they operate. The second category is the wealthy people who want to move from tier-2 cities to tier-1 cities. They want their second generation to live in tier-1 cities. The third ones are the CEOs and CFOs of large multinational companies,” he said.\nVishal Raheja, Founder and Managing Director, InvestoXpert Advisors, said that investment motivation plays an equally strong role in the purchase of such properties.\n\"NRIs and strategic investors are also actively acquiring premium residences driven by strong capital appreciation potential, attractive rental yields in prime business corridors, and limited high-quality inventory that ensures sustained resale value,” he said.\nRaheja added that an emerging segment of younger, affluent professionals and dual-income households in tech, finance, and services also prefer to buy branded properties as they seek exclusivity, security, wellness and globally benchmarked amenities.\nKey factors driving growth of luxury or branded residences\nAshish Narain Agarwal, the founder and Managing Director of PropertyPistol, a real estate consultant, said that infrastructure development, strategic urban planning, expanding expressways, metro connectivity, and proximity to the upcoming Noida International Airport are fueling Noida’s transformation.\nAlso Read: M3M–Jacob & Co branded 5BHK residences sell out at Rs 40,000 per sq ft in Noida — highest-ever rate for the city\nStrong corporate growth driven by IT parks, industrial corridors, and global capability centres (GCC) has created a high-income working population seeking premium lifestyle housing.\n“Alongside this, growing demand for modern amenities, wellness-led environments, security, and branded living experiences has encouraged developers to introduce world-class luxury offerings. As a result, Noida is evolving from a functional residential zone into a sophisticated luxury destination offering global-standard living, lifestyle convenience, and strong investment prospects,” he said.\nRavi Nirwal, Principal Partner and Sales Director, Square Yards, said that the availability of large, contiguous land parcels in Noida has allowed developers to plan integrated, low-density projects with premium amenities, which is often difficult in more saturated markets.\nComparison of Noida with Mumbai, Delhi, and Gurugram\nRaheja of InvestoXperts said that Noida today stands out as one of India’s most competitive premium real estate destinations, offering a balance of affordability, lifestyle excellence, and future-ready infrastructure.\nAccording to data from InvestoXpert, property prices in Noida typically range between Rs 9,000 – Rs 15,000 per sqft, with ultra-luxury developments oscillating between Rs 15,000 – Rs 40,000 per sq ft, compared with Delhi-NCR’s regional luxury average of Rs 23,000 per sq ft.\nAverage pricing in Gurugram ranges between Rs 20,000 and Rs 37,000 per sq ft in premium corridors, while Mumbai’s average pricing is significantly higher, from Rs 40,000 per sq ft to over Rs 100,000 in marquee micro-markets.\nUnlike Mumbai, where ultra luxury is often defined by scarcity and location, or central Delhi, where legacy and exclusivity play a major role, Noida’s premium offerings are more focused on scale, modern infrastructure and planned development, said Nirwal of Square Yards.\n“When compared to Gurugram, which has a more mature luxury ecosystem and proximity to corporate headquarters, Noida is emerging as an alternative for buyers prioritising newer infrastructure and comparatively competitive pricing,” he said.",

        "full_content": "As the Union Budget 2026 draws near, India’s real estate sector has urged the government to grant the sector an industry status, digitise land records and introduce a simplified single-window clearance mechanism to accelerate approvals and revive demand.\nIndustry bodies and developers argue that recognising real estate as an “industry” would unlock cheaper long-term institutional credit, lower borrowing costs and broader access to structured financing.\nDevelopers said that industry status has been a long-pending demand and they remain optimistic, expecting sustained policy support in the budget.\n“The real estate sector currently contributes around 7 percent to India’s GDP and supports over 200 allied industries. Granting industry status to real estate sector would improve access to institutional funding and enable the sector to play a stronger role in job creation and economic growth. Real estate has the potential to contribute up to 15 percent to India’s GDP by 2047 with the help of adequate policy support,”  Signature Global (India) Ltd founder and chairman Pradeep Aggarwal has said.\nTribeca Developers group CEO Rajat Khandelwal said the sector is looking for policy continuity that supports both supply and demand. “Granting industry status to real estate remains crucial, as it would ease access to long-term capital; lower borrowing costs, and improve execution efficiency for developers,” he said.\nKhandelwal said real estate growth is closely tied to infrastructure. Increased investments in urban infrastructure, public transport and smart city initiatives will not only make cities liveable but also strengthen the realty sector.\nSterling Developers chairman and managing director Ramani Sastri said industry status will help the real estate sector realise its full potential, as it will unlock affordable funding and streamline regulatory processes.\n“Overall, we would like to see announcements to enhance ease of doing business for the developers to create positive climate for real estate investment,” he said.\nSingle-window clearance and digitisation of land records\nDevelopers have also sought single-window clearances, consolidating approvals from multiple authorities on a unified digital platform. It will cut the red tape, reduce project gestation periods and enhance transparency, they have argued.\nTRG Group MD Shorab Upadhyay said realtors are looking forward to a Union Budget that brings in stability, liquidity and confidence in the real estate sector.\n“We expect better policy support towards faster project approvals, single-window clearances, and digitisation of land records, which are much-needed steps in substantially enhancing ease of doing business and accelerating delivery timelines,” he said.\nNotandas Realty managing director  Harsh Jagwani said a single-window clearance system is “long overdue” and capable of accelerating approvals and injecting much-needed efficiency into project execution.\nThe government should also bring reforms in the digitisation process of land as well as property acquisition. “This will not only help in accelerating the pace of development of new projects but also ease the process of buying new homes for homebuyers in general. Cleaner land-title system, stricter escrow enforcement under RERA will also help reduce transaction risk and financing delays,” he said.",

Another 2,854 units across 32 towers are awaiting regulatory approvals, with the developer saying OCs are expected over the next few months.\nRelief for buyers stuck in limbo\nFor buyers who have been paying home loan EMIs without possession for years, the issuance of OCs is the first concrete sign that homes may finally be handed over.\n“Construction completion is important, but for us the real relief comes only when OCs are issued and possession starts,” said a homebuyer from the Kosmos project, who booked the apartment in 2012.\nJaypee Infratech was admitted to insolvency in 2017, leaving more than 20,000 homebuyers across its Noida and Greater Noida projects in limbo. After multiple failed resolution attempts, Suraksha Group took over the company in 2024, promising time-bound delivery under a court-approved resolution plan.\nAnother homebuyer and a representative of a Kensington Park homebuyers’ group said that they have seen promises earlier too, so buyers are cautiously optimistic.\n“Receiving OCs for 31 towers is a positive development, but the real test will be timely handover, completion of common facilities, and basic services like water and power,” he asserted.\nProjects cleared, more awaiting approvals\nThe towers that have received OCs are spread across projects including JP Kosmos, Klassic, Kensington Boulevard Apartments, and Kensington Park Apartments and Heights, covering 3,135 units.\nJash Panchamia, Executive Director at Jaypee Infratech Ltd, said that 63 towers have been completed and OCs have already been received for 31 towers. He said that the company expects OCs for another 32 towers over the next couple of months.\nHe said that construction on the remaining towers is progressing and deliveries would be aligned with timelines laid out under the resolution framework.\n“Despite crippling restrictions imposed on construction activities due to GRAP rules during winter months every year, we remain fully committed to fulfilling our customers’ expectations and delivering as per the resolution plan,” Panchamia said.\nBuyers, however, said that regulatory approvals are critical not only for possession but also for financial closure. “Without an OC, banks don’t allow us to complete registration, and we remain stuck paying EMIs and rent simultaneously. Even a few months’ delay has a real financial impact on families,” said a buyer from the Klassic project.",

The building was earlier occupied by CRISIL, which taken up by COWRKS and then leased to JPMorgan. Market observers said that the latest deal is part of the company’s long-term GCC expansion plans.\nAccording to document, the lease will start from April 1, 2026, and the tenure of the lease is five years. The tenants will also have an option of renewing the lease after five years for another five years.\nThe monthly rent is Rs 9.23 crore and in five years the total rent will translate to Rs 612 crore after considering 5 percent yearly escalation in rentals, the documents showed.\nThe tenant paid a stamp duty and registration fee of Rs 7.28 crore for the transaction. The company also made a security deposit of Rs 55.38 crore. The deal was executed on Dec 29, 2025.\nThe deal includes ground and 3rd to 9th floor of the building with total leasable area of 2.71 lakh square feet and carpet area of 1.77 lakh square feet. Kairos Properties Private Limited owns the building, which is a part of Brookfield India Real Estate Trust.\nThere was no immediate response available from J Morgan and COWRKS towards queries sent by Moneycontrol. The copy will be updated after receiving a response.\nThe premises leased by JPMorgan is designed for total 2,381 seats, 257 meeting rooms.\nRaja Seetharaman, Cofounder of Propstack, said that the deal allows Brookfield to capture value across the entire lifecycle—refilling the vacated CRISIL space via COWRKS while securing a long-term development deal.\n“For JPMorgan, it’s a seamless expansion in Powai, bridging the gap between their immediate needs and the delivery of their massive 1.3 million sqft campus,” he said.\nEarlier in June 2025, JPMorgan has leased 1.16 lakh square feet of office space at an under-construction development by Japanese firm Sumitomo Realty and Development's India subsidiary Goisu Realty at Bandra Kurla Complex in Mumbai for a monthly rent of Rs 6.91 crore.\nPowai’s rise as an office destination\nMarket observers said that Powai’s proximity to key business corridors like Andheri, SEEPZ, Vikhroli and the Eastern Express Highway, along with improving social infrastructure, has made it attractive for BFSI, IT and global capability centres (GCCs).\nAnalysts said that the latest transaction underscores Powai’s growing stature as a preferred office hub for global financial services and technology firms, at a time when occupiers are increasingly seeking high-quality office spaces beyond Mumbai’s traditional business districts such as Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) and Nariman Point.\nJPMorgan’s leasing move comes amid a broader trend of global financial institutions expanding their India footprint driven by cost efficiencies, access to skilled talent and India’s growing role in global financial services operations.",

        "full_content": "Mumbai-based developers Shree Naman Group and Oberoi Realty have emerged as the top bidders for an 11 acre plot in Bandra (East), owned by the Indian Railways, according to sources from the Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA), which is conducting the bidding process. The land is slated to be handed over to the winning bidder for a lease period of 99 years.\nAccording to tender documents, the plot, wedged between the Western Railway tracks and the Western Express Highway, has a reserve price of Rs 5,365 crore. The area is also located near the Bandra Kurla Complex business district. Additionally, the winning bidder is expected to share at least 45 percent of revenue generated from the project. The plot carries a floor-space index (FSI)- indicating the developable area relative to the size of the plot- of 4.0.\nMoneycontrol has approached both Shree Naman Group and Oberoi Realty for comment on the matter, and the story will be updated once a response is received.\nPeople aware of the matter said that the developable area at the site is expected to be around 1.9-2 million square feet, with the existing FSI of the plot. The site is expected to be developed into a mixed-use property, with commercial and residential properties, as well as a small retail component integrated into the premises. They added that with the area's property prices and large land price component may help form the strategy for the winning bidder.\n\"The surrounding area does not have too much residential development, and the area's home prices trade at a discount compared to Bandra (West) or core Bandra Kurla Complex, at around Rs 60,000-65,000 per square foot. So the winning developer may either choose to develop the residential component entirely to sell the inventory and completely pay off the RLDA, or they may choose to build offices on part of the land, earn rental income, and pay the revenue share over time, despite an interest component. The economics of the development due to the large land cost needs to be worked on,\" said one of the people.\nAnother property market observer said that a commercial development may be beneficial to developers, due to the plot's proximity to the Bandra railway station, enabling easy access for employees. The new commercial supply may also attract more tenants, due to low vacancies at Bandra Kurla Complex.\nThe RLDA tender is one of multiple similar deals in Mumbai, with the railways being one of the largest land holders in the city. In December 2025, infrastructure firm Dineshchandra R Agarwal Infracon emerged as the highest bidder for a six acre plot at Supari Baug in Parel, also owned by the railways. The firm had bid Rs 1,368 crore for the plot.\nAdditional plots in Mumbai for sale, lease, or development by the RLDA includes areas such as Thane, Mahalaxmi, among other suburbs.",

        "full_content": "The Uttar Pradesh government’s revised township policy and broader real estate reforms are showing strong results, with capital investment in the sector rising sharply over the past year.\nAccording to a report released by the Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority, investments in the state’s real estate sector touched Rs 68,328 crore in 2025, up from Rs 44,526 crore in 2024. This represents an increase of about 53.5 percent. The authority said 309 projects were registered during the year, reflecting growing investor confidence in the state’s policy framework.\n“Pro-government policies, especially the revised township policy and faster regulatory clearances, have significantly improved ease of doing business in real estate. This is directly reflected in the sharp rise in investment and project registrations,” Indu Prakash Sharma, of Trio Vision Infra told this reporter.\nThe surge follows key amendments to the township policy, under which the minimum land requirement for developing townships was reduced from 25 acres to 12.5 acres. The revised policy also introduced stricter timelines for project completion to protect the interests of homebuyers. Under the new norms, townships spread over 25 acres must be completed within three years, while larger projects have a maximum completion period of five years.\nEarlier, several large projects had remained stalled for eight to twelve years, leading to buyers’ funds being locked up. Officials said the new provisions have brought relief to both investors and allottees by improving project viability and ensuring faster delivery.\nWhile the National Capital Region has traditionally dominated Uttar Pradesh’s real estate landscape, 2025 data indicates a clear shift towards non-NCR districts and smaller cities. Of the total projects registered during the year, 122 were in the NCR, while 186 were approved in non NCR areas.\nThe trend underlines the impact of infrastructure expansion, improved connectivity and focused development of tier two cities. Lucknow emerged as a major hub with 67 projects registered. Bareilly recorded 15 projects and Agra 14. New investments were also seen in Bulandshahar, Rampur, Chandauli, Unnao, Gonda, Mau and Mirzapur, pointing to a wider geographical spread of real estate activity across the state.\nReligious tourism has also played a significant role in driving real estate growth. Mathura saw 23 projects registered in 2025. Ayodhya recorded five projects, Varanasi nine and Prayagraj seven.\n“The large-scale redevelopment of Ayodhya, Varanasi and Mathura, along with a sharp rise in religious tourism, has created strong demand for housing, hospitality and commercial projects,” Vishal Singh, a government spokesman said. “These cities are no longer just pilgrimage destinations. They are fast emerging as new real estate growth centres.”\nReal estate developers say the broader improvement in the state’s investment climate has played a crucial role in changing perceptions about Uttar Pradesh.\n“Over the last few years, there is a very positive vibe about Uttar Pradesh. Earlier, many big investors were not willing to come here. Now you can see major names entering the state, whether it is large housing projects, logistics parks, industries or townships,” said Amit Srivastava, CEO of BBD Viraj Group and a member of CREDAI.\nHe pointed to infrastructure upgrades such as new expressways, including the Lucknow-Delhi connectivity, as well as improvements in electricity supply, law and order, and ease of doing business doing wonders to UP’s march to prosperity.\n“One of the most transformative decisions has been allowing land-use conversion through development authorities. Earlier, this process was with the Revenue Board and used to take a very long time, which was not business-friendly. Now approvals are faster, and that has unlocked a lot of stalled and new investments,” Srivastava said.\nOfficials said improved connectivity, urban redevelopment programmes and a steady rise in tourist and devotee footfall are helping these cities emerge as new centres of real estate development in Uttar Pradesh and hoped that the state will maintain strong momentum in the coming years.",

        "full_content": "Residential sales in 2025 declined by 1 percent in 2025, after four straight years of growth, amid concerns in the market about the real estate cycle turning negative over the past year. A report from Knight Frank India shows that 3,48,207 homes were sold across the top eight markets in India for the year, down from 3,50,612 units in 2024.\nExperts, however, noted that while the current sales figures have cast doubts among investors and observers about the sector's future, the situation remains steady, with no major upheaval expected soon. Sales in the affordable category continued to be weak, and sales momentum in premium and luxury segments continued to grow, as has been the trend since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"Even as sales are lower this year, the situation is not yet raising concern. Looking ahead, we do not see a sharp fall or decline in real estate sales,\" said Gulam Zia, senior executive director at Knight Frank India, addressing a press briefing.\nShishir Baijal, Knight Frank India's chairman and managing director, added that Grade-A developers, who cater to premium price points, continue to perform well. He added that the sluggishness of sales in the affordable category (priced less than Rs 50 lakh) may be related to the quality of the products on offer.\nThe National Capital Region saw a significant decline in sales- 9 percent- while sales in Mumbai, India's largest housing market, were largely flat, as was the case in Bengaluru.\nLaunches down\nData from Knight Frank India also noted that launch activity across the top eight markets declined by 3 percent to 3,62,184 units for the year. Unsold inventory also rose slightly during the year to 5,09,815 units. Home prices in all major markets grew during the year, despite the decline in sales, with prices in NCR growing by a significant 19 percent. In Mumbai, prices grew by a moderate 7 percent, while in Bengaluru and Hyderabad, homes were dearer by 12 percent and 13 percent respectively.\nLaunches in NCR were down 16 percent, while in Mumbai, it was down by 10 percent. Bengaluru and Chennai were the only major markets where residential launches rose, by 23 percent and 20 percent respectively.\nMarket observers said that the decline in launches may also be related to supply-side constraints, rather than demand issues.\n\"India’s residential project launches have declined year-on-year, driven largely by supply-side constraints rather than a demand slowdown. Developers are contending with elevated land and construction costs, a visible slowdown in equity funding, and stricter compliance norms for debt raising, all of which have tightened project feasibility and delayed new starts,\" said Pawan Agarwal, MD of NK Realtors, a large broker in eastern India.\nAlso slowing down projects are regulatory approval timelines, developers added, with many projects over the last year delayed due to a key Supreme Court case related to the Union government's remit over eco-sensitive zones.\n\"...Approvals in many cities are taking longer. This delays the pipeline even as demand is robust. This is temporary and current mismatch between high absorption and slower new supply will keep prices stable for the next 12–18 months,\" said Haresh Kishor, MD of KG Developers.\nHowever, the quarters-to-sell, defined as the time required to sell existing inventory at ongoing sales run rates with no new stock being added, remained constant at 5.8 quarters, signifying a largely healthy market, said Ankita Sood, national director of research at Knight Frank India.",

        "full_content": "With Budget 2026 less than a week away, the conversation around income-tax has shifted from big announcements to practical concerns. For many middle-class households, the focus is on whether the coming year will bring clarity, predictability and fewer compliance surprises, especially with a new income-tax law set to take effect from April 1.\nThe transition to the Income Tax Act, 2026, is already shaping expectations. One of the most visible changes under the new law is the move to a “tax year” system, which replaces the long-standing distinction between “previous year” and “assessment year”.\nReady for tax-year system?\nAligning the year of earning income with the year of reporting and assessment is intended to make compliance more intuitive, Anita Basrur, Partner at Sudit K Parekh & Co. LLP, said.\nRevised return forms will require more granular disclosures for deductions such as HRA, home loan interest and claims under Sections 80C and 80D, all of which will need to be reconciled with AIS and Form 26AS data, reflecting a sharper, data-led compliance framework, she said.\nAmong salaried taxpayers, expectations from the Budget remain modest but specific. Sakchi Jain, a chartered accountant (CA) said the middle class is in urgent need of meaningful relief rather than symbolic tweaks. She pointed to the standard deduction as an area where relief could be felt immediately, noting that the Rs 2 lakh cap on home loan interest has remained unchanged for years despite rising property prices.\nJain also highlighted capital gains taxation as a pain point, arguing that the current structure remains complex and in need of simplified holding periods and rationalised rates. On compliance, she questioned the logic of multiple TDS categories and rates, especially where transactions are already covered under GST.\nNew law worries\nConcerns around readiness for the new law are also growing. Isha Jaiswal, another CA, drew attention to the operational strain within the tax system, with over 5.49 lakh appeals pending before appellate authorities.\nShe said the challenge is not the new law but the lack of clarity around forms, filing procedures and implementation guidelines so close to the rollout date. Without adequate transition support, even honest taxpayers could slip into non-compliance unintentionally, Jaiswal said.\nRitika Nayyar, Partner at Singhania & Co, said, “The middle class is looking for realistic relief measures such as an increase in the basic exemption limit, widening of tax slabs and enhancement of the standard deduction. She added that reintroducing select deductions under the new tax regime could help improve disposable incomes, particularly at a time when the cost of living continues to rise.”\nMarket participants are also watching for clarity on capital market taxation. Kunal Savani, Partner at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, said taxpayers are expecting clearer guidance on the applicability of rebates under Section 87A to capital gains. Such clarity, he said, could ease tax burdens for investors and encourage broader participation in capital markets, which have seen steady growth in recent years.\nFor salaried taxpayers, however, the immediate focus remains on take-home pay. Alay Razvi, Managing Partner at Accord Juris, said expectations from Budget 2026 are centered on making the new tax regime more attractive through a higher standard deduction, rationalised slabs and a higher exemption threshold. While sweeping cuts appear unlikely, he said calibrated tweaks that improve net income without straining fiscal discipline could offer meaningful relief to inflation-hit households.",

Each carries its own risks, rewards and role in a portfolio.\nIn the past year, the precious metals have been on a record-breaking spree. Gold has risen about 92 percent, supported by steady investor demand and its role as a safe place for money. Silver has outperformed gold by a margin, surging around 236 percent, driven by both investment interest and rising industrial demand.\nGold generally performs well during market dips, geopolitical tensions and currency devaluation. Silver is more cyclical. Despite being a precious metal, nearly 50 percent of silver demand arises from industrial uses such as solar panels, electric vehicles, electronics, and semiconductors.\nGold is often called the ultimate store of value. Central banks hold it, and investors turn to it in times of crisis. Over decades, its price has moved steadily higher, though not always smoothly.\n\"Silver’s sharp rise is driven by a mix of structural and cyclical factors. On the structural side, demand from solar, electronics, EVs, and green energy remains strong, while mine supply and recycling growth are limited, keeping the market in deficit,\" Renisha Chainani, Head of Research, Augmont, said.\nThe recent pace of gains has also been fuelled by short covering and speculative flows, which makes near-term corrections likely. \"So, while volatility may increase and sharp pullbacks are possible, the broader demand shift suggests this is not just a short-lived rally but one that may consolidate before moving higher,\" Chainani said.\nWhat should investors do?\nFor many long-term investors, the answer is not one or the other. A mix can smooth returns and spread risk.\n\"For long-term investors, gold offers a better risk-reward balance due to its lower volatility, strong central bank demand, and proven role as a hedge against inflation, geopolitical risk, and currency debasement. Silver, while offering higher upside potential, comes with significantly higher volatility and is more sensitive to economic cycles,\" Chainani said.\nSatish Dondapati, Fund Manager, Kotak Mutual Fund, sai , “Gold is safer and more stable, so it suits conservative investors who want to protect their money over time.\" Its price does not move too sharply.\n\"Silver is riskier and suits aggressive investors because its prices are more volatile, but it can give higher returns when markets are strong,\" said Dondapati.\nIn simple terms, gold is for safety, while silver is for higher but risky returns. A balanced approach using both metals can optimise risk and return.",

The world’s largest cryptocurrency remained volatile, as it had touched $88,760 before taking the fall.\n\"Bitcoin is stabilising after successfully defending the $86,000 level, hinting at a near-term recovery. Fears around a possible US government shutdown led to a brief risk-off move, but the narrative is now improving as the dollar weakens to a four-month low, driving flows back into assets like Bitcoin and gold,\" said Akshat Siddhant, Lead Quant Analyst, Mudrex.\nAccording to Riya Sehgal, Research Analyst, Delta Exchange, BTC faces stiff resistance between $89,500 and $91,000, with support around $86,000.

Please advise how we should move ahead?\nExpert’s advice: The concept of ancestral property is no longer valid after the enactment of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, unless the property was acquired before the enactment of the law.  The properties acquired by your father out of his own earnings are his personal assets and not the assets of the Hindu Undivided Family (HUF).\nUnder the Indian Succession Act, a will is not required to be registered to make it valid and legally enforceable. Therefore, the will executed by your father is very much valid unless it is contested on some other grounds.\nThe Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, which came into force on September 9, 2005, amended the 1956 Act to grant daughters equal coparcenary rights to ancestral property, allowing them to be coparceners by birth just like sons.\nYour sisters can claim their share in the assets which your father had bequeathed in his will. Had your father passed away without leaving a will, which is called dying intestate, all the legal heirs, your sisters and brothers along with your mother (if alive) and paternal grandmother (if alive) are entitled to get an equal share in the assets left by your father as per the scheme of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956.\nIn case only some of the assets have been bequeathed by your father under the will, the assets that are not bequeathed will be inherited by the above legal heirs equally.",

        "full_content": "As India prepares for Budget 2026, retirement planning has quietly and steadily moved higher on the list of priorities for both policymakers and savers. One area gaining increased attention is the taxation of annuities, which for many retirees remains a consistent, though modest, source of post-work income.\nWith about 160 million people aged 60 and older, India is home to the second-largest elderly population in the world. This number is likely to increase to 230 million in 2036, about 15% of the total population, according to government estimates. Add to this the fact that the average life expectancy in India has increased about 14 years between 1990 and 2025.\nThis vast ageing population underlines the burgeoning pension and annuity market in India. An annuity caters to the key dilemma of a pensioner, for a life-long pension at a steady, guaranteed rate and exposes the investors to a reinvestment rate risk, especially in a volatile interest rate scenario.\n“Annuities are the only solution, which provide complete protection from the perspective of living longer (i.e. outliving one’s corpus), by providing a regular flow of income throughout one’s lifetime.\nCurrently, an annuity is completely taxed in the hands of the customer. Hence, a tax break on annuity could further encourage Indians to opt for these instruments, providing the much-needed social security to many during their golden years. Further, this will help insurance companies invest in long-rated bonds and channelise long-term savings into capital-intensive sectors,” said Subhrajit Mukhopadhyay, Deputy CEO and ED, Edelweiss Life Insurance.\nIt is pertinent to note that India’s insurance sector has made steady progress, but penetration and coverage gaps remain significant, particularly in retirement planning and rural protection.\nTarun Chugh, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Bajaj Life Insurance, said, \"Aligning the tax treatment of insurance annuities with other pension instruments, such as taxing only the returns on annuity payouts and extending comparable deductions, would allow individuals to choose retirement products based on suitability rather than tax differences. Similarly, bringing parity in taxation between traditional and unit-linked life insurance policies can simplify the tax framework and encourage disciplined, long-term wealth creation alongside protection.\"\nWhile the Indian government has already implemented several progressive reforms in recent years to sustain domestic demand and support its growth trajectory, analysts say the upcoming budget now presents an opportunity to shift focus towards long-term household financial security, particularly by easing the tax burden on retirement income and encouraging wider adoption of pension and annuity products.\nAmong its key reforms are the introduction of GST 2.0. and allowance of 100% FDI in insurance. As a part of GST 2.0 reforms, the government announced 0% GST on individual insurance products, signalling that insurance is an essential instrument.\nMukhopadhyay said, “The GST 2.0 measure has provided a fillip to the insurance sector, as evidenced in the November and December growth numbers. 100% FDI has also bolstered the market sentiment and improved the outlook for the sector. In the upcoming Union Budget FY 2026 – 2027, we expect a continuation in government’s efforts to bring ease of business, boost capital inflow into the Indian economy, and further the agenda of Insurance for All 2047.”",

        "full_content": "As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, tax experts are urging the government to expand the scope of deductions under the new tax regime, with home loans, medical insurance, and other key deductions emerging as top priorities.\nMedical inflation continues to be one of the biggest challenges facing India’s healthcare system, projected at 11.5%–14%, among the highest in Asia. While measures such as the removal of GST on insurance premiums and allowing 100 percent FDI in insurance can improve affordability and sector resilience, rising medical costs continue to put pressure on Indian households.\nPrashant Mishra, founder and CEO, Agnam Advisors, said, \"Here is what I as an SEBI Registered Investment Advisor think government should focus on: Simplifying the new tax regime by integrating key deductions such as housing loan interest, medical insurance under Section 80D (raised to Rs 50,000 for self/family and Rs 1 lakh for seniors), and a potential 25% slab for Rs 30-50 lakh earners would ease compliance burdens and provide equitable relief amid rising living costs. These changes would empower families to allocate more towards productive investments rather than litigation-prone structures.\"\nAs the Union Budget 2026–27 approaches, there is an opportunity to strengthen healthcare affordability by increasing public health spending and sharpening the focus on prevention. \"Currently, public health expenditure in India remains below global benchmarks and even short of the National Health Policy target of 2.5% of GDP in 2025. Enhancing the budgetary outlay for public health would strengthen primary care networks, expand preventive services, and relieve financial stress on citizens,\" said Srikanth Kandikonda, Chief Financial Officer, ManipalCigna Health Insurance.\n\"At the same time, policy measures that encourage preventive healthcare can significantly lower long-term treatment costs. Industry reports indicate that preventive care reduces hospitalisations and improves health outcomes. Introducing separate and enhanced tax benefits for OPD services and preventive health screenings, beyond the current limits under Section 80D, would encourage wider adoption of preventive care,\" added Kandikonda. The sections can be added to the new tax regime to provide better support to senior citizens.\nEnhancing retirement savings deductions and incentives for green projects or AIFs in GIFT City aligns with sustainable, long-term strategies tailored for HNIs. \"Rationalising surcharges, extending tax-neutral LLP reorganisations, and clarifying TDS on partners remuneration would streamline family office operations, fostering smoother wealth transfers across generations. Family-centric boosts, like higher allowances for elderly and child care, address demographic shifts, unlocking productivity for working professionals,\" said Mishra.\nShubham Gupta, CFA and Co-founder of Growthvine Capital, said, “As we get closer to the 2026 Union Budget, the focus of both taxpayers and businesses is on developing a fairer, more simplified, and predictable new tax regime, which many believe will improve household consumption and savings.”\nWith the new regime now the default option, expectations are rising that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman may use this year’s Budget to better balance lower rates with meaningful incentives, aiming to boost home ownership, encourage insurance adoption, and strengthen household financial security.",

        "full_content": "As investors grapple with persistent global uncertainty ranging from geopolitical tensions to sticky inflation and volatile equity markets precious metals are once again finding a central place in portfolios. But instead of choosing between gold or silver, there is also another option of turning to a mix gold and silver fund of funds (FoFs) that invest in gold ETFs and silver ETFs, seeking a balance between stability and growth.\nThe logic behind these FoFs rests on the fundamentally different, yet complementary, roles that gold and silver play in a portfolio.\nGold for stability, silver for growth\nGold has long been viewed as a financial safe haven. It tends to perform well during equity market downturns, periods of geopolitical stress and phases of currency weakness. Over the past few years, gold prices have been supported by aggressive central bank buying, de-dollarisation trends and demand for portfolio protection. As a result, gold has delivered steady returns while cushioning portfolios during sharp equity drawdowns.\nSilver, by contrast, is far more cyclical. While it is also a precious metal, nearly 50 percent of silver demand comes from industrial uses, including solar panels, electric vehicles, electronics and semiconductors. This gives silver a stronger growth linkage to the global economic cycle and new-age technologies. When precious metals enter a bull phase, silver has historically outperformed gold but with significantly higher volatility.\nThis divergence is precisely what makes a combination of the two attractive.\nWhy gold and silver work better together\nData from Edelweiss Mutual Fund shows that a 50:50 allocation to gold and silver has historically delivered a smoother return profile than silver alone, while generating higher returns than gold-only exposure over longer periods.\nDuring equity market stress, gold tends to limit downside. Silver may underperform in such phases, but its long-term growth drivers help boost overall returns during recoveries and commodity upcycles. The combined allocation therefore helps investors avoid the extremes—neither being too defensive nor overly volatile.\nFor instance, while silver delivered very sharp gains in the last one year, it has also seen deeper interim corrections in weaker years. Gold, on the other hand, has shown lower drawdowns and more consistent performance. A blended gold-silver approach helps balance these cycles.\nFor instance, in calendar year (CY) 2014, gold delivered a negative return of 8 percent, while silver performed worse with a decline of 16 percent. Similarly, in 2021, gold posted a negative return of 4 percent compared with an 8 percent fall in silver.\nIn 2025, however, silver delivered an extraordinary return of 167 percent, far outperforming gold’s 75 percent gain.\nThe data shows that while silver can generate sharp gains, it has also experienced deeper corrections in the past.\nThe role of FoFs investing via ETFs\nGold and silver FoFs typically invest in gold ETFs and silver ETFs, rather than holding physical metals. This structure offers several advantages.\nFirst, ETFs closely track domestic spot prices of gold and silver, ensuring transparency and lower tracking error. Second, ETFs provide daily liquidity and eliminate concerns around storage, purity and insurance associated with physical metals. Third, FoFs add another layer of convenience by handling allocation and rebalancing between gold and silver internally.\nMost gold and silver FoFs aim to maintain an equal allocation between the two metals, with periodic rebalancing to manage deviations caused by price movements. This disciplined approach ensures that investors systematically book profits from outperforming assets and add to laggards—something most retail investors struggle to do on their own.\nOne of the biggest advantages of gold and silver FoFs is that they remove the need for tactical timing. Instead of deciding when to increase gold exposure or bet on silver’s rally, investors get a ready-made diversification within commodities.\nAccording to the Edelweiss report, a combined gold-silver portfolio has historically helped limit downside during equity downturns while still participating meaningfully in upside phases of precious metal rallies\nThis makes such FoFs particularly suitable for investors who want precious metals as a strategic allocation rather than a short-term trading bet.\nWho should consider gold and silver FoFs?\nGold and silver FoFs are best suited for investors looking to:",

        "full_content": "Most people land up comparing loans only when something has already gone wrong. A hospital bill arrives, a payment deadline looms, or cash flow just doesn’t line up one month. At that point, you are not shopping leisurely. You want money in the account, fast, and without too much back and forth.\nThat is where the choice usually narrows to a personal loan or a loan against securities. Both can solve the problem, but they feel very different once you start using them.\nWhy personal loans feel easier in a crisis\nA personal loan is straightforward. There is no asset to pledge, no portfolio to review, no daily tracking. If your salary and credit score tick the right boxes, the bank approves it and the money shows up. For someone already stressed, that simplicity matters.\nThe EMI is fixed, the tenure is clear, and nothing changes midway. You are not worrying about markets or margins while dealing with a family emergency. You just pay the EMI and move on.\nThe catch, of course, is the cost. Personal loans are expensive because they are unsecured. You pay interest on the entire amount from day one, even if you needed the money only for a short gap. If the loan runs for a few years, the total interest can add up more than people initially expect.\nPersonal loans usually work best when the amount is not very large, the need is immediate, and you want zero complications.\nHow loan against securities plays out in real life\nA loan against securities sounds more technical, but it can be very effective if you already invest. You pledge mutual funds, shares or similar instruments, and the lender gives you a credit limit based on their value.\nWhat makes LAS attractive is how flexible it can be. In many cases, it works like an overdraft. You draw money when needed and repay when cash comes in. Interest is charged only on what you actually use and for how long you use it.\nFor short-term needs, this can be significantly cheaper than a personal loan. It also lets you avoid selling investments at a bad time, especially during market corrections.\nBut it is not completely hands-off. Markets move. If the value of your pledged investments falls sharply, the lender may ask you to add more security or repay part of the loan. That can be uncomfortable if you are already dealing with financial pressure.\nLAS works best when you have a decent investment cushion, expect to repay relatively quickly, and are comfortable keeping an eye on things.\nThe emotional side of borrowing\nThis is the part people don’t talk about enough. A personal loan costs more, but it is mentally lighter. Nothing you own is at stake. A loan against securities is cheaper, but it ties your borrowing to market movements, which not everyone wants to deal with during a stressful phase.\nThere is no universally “better” option. The right choice depends on how urgent the need is, how long you expect to borrow, and how much complexity you can tolerate.\nIf you want speed and certainty, a personal loan does exactly what it promises. If you want lower costs and already have investments you are not keen to sell, a loan against securities can be a smarter tool. The key is choosing the one that lets you sleep better while solving the problem at hand.",

        "full_content": "Most of us treat a bank locker as the final stop for worry. Once the jewellery is inside, we mentally tick the “safe” box and move on. After all, it’s a bank vault. What could go wrong?\nThe problem is not theft or carelessness. The problem is assumption. Very few people actually know what happens if something does go wrong, and the rules are far less comforting than most families expect.\nWhat the bank will pay and what it won’t\nUnder rules issued by the Reserve Bank of India, banks do have responsibility in certain situations. If jewellery is lost because of fire, burglary, robbery, a building collapse, or fraud by a bank employee, the bank is liable. But only up to a point.\nThat point is 100 times your annual locker rent.\nSo if your locker rent is Rs 2,000 a year, the maximum compensation is Rs 2 lakh. Today, that may not even cover one small necklace or a couple of bangles. For families who have stored jewellery accumulated over decades, the gap between value and compensation can be huge.\nThis catches people off guard because many assume the bank will compensate based on what the gold is worth. It doesn’t work like that.\nNatural disasters? You’re on your own\nHere is the part most people don’t like hearing. If the loss happens because of floods, earthquakes, lightning or similar natural events, the bank has no financial liability at all. Zero.\nThe jewellery may be inside a reinforced vault, but financially speaking, the entire risk sits with the customer. Paying higher rent or choosing a bigger bank does not change this rule.\nWhy banks don’t insure locker contents\nBanks don’t insure what you keep inside your locker, and they are not allowed to offer you insurance for it either. The reason is simple. The bank doesn’t know what’s inside. There is no list, no valuation, and no record of what goes in or out.\nBecause of this, locker agreements clearly push the responsibility back to the customer. Most people sign these forms without a second thought, assuming it’s just standard paperwork.\nWhat actually protects your gold\nIf you want real protection, insurance is the only way to get it. General insurance companies offer jewellery cover that protects against theft, burglary, fire and even natural calamities. This protection applies even if the jewellery is kept in a bank locker.\nFor many households, the easiest route is to add a jewellery or valuables cover to a home insurance policy. These covers are broader than most people realise. In many cases, they also protect jewellery when it is temporarily worn for weddings or family functions.\nYes, there is a premium to pay. But compared to the value of gold today, it is usually a small price for knowing that a lifetime of savings is not sitting uninsured.\nShould you rethink lockers altogether?\nA bank locker still has its place, especially for jewellery that is rarely used. But it should not be mistaken for complete protection. Some people are exploring alternatives like gold overdrafts, where gold is pledged and the bank becomes fully responsible for its safety.\nThat option can also help unlock the value of gold without selling it, though it is not practical for jewellery that needs to be accessed frequently.\nThe bottom line\nA locker keeps gold physically secure, but it does not protect its full value. With gold prices where they are today, it is worth taking another look at what is in your locker and asking a simple question: if something went wrong tomorrow, would the compensation be anywhere close to enough?\nFor many families, adding insurance is not an extra step. It is the missing one.",

        "full_content": "One of the hardest questions in retirement planning is also the most practical one: how much money can you safely take out every year without running out?\nThere is no single number that works for everyone. The “right” withdrawal rate depends on how long your retirement might last, how your money is invested, how your expenses change over time, and how much flexibility you have if things don’t go to plan. But there are some useful ways to think about it.\nWhy this question matters more than returns\nMost people focus heavily on returns before retirement. Once retirement starts, withdrawals matter far more.\nEven a well-sized corpus can fail if withdrawals are too aggressive in the early years. This is because of something called sequence risk: if markets fall early in retirement while you are also withdrawing money, the damage compounds. You are selling assets when prices are low, leaving less money to recover later.\nThat’s why a “safe” withdrawal rate is really about protecting against bad timing, not just average returns.\nThe popular 4 percent rule, and its limits\nYou may have heard of the 4 percent rule. It suggests that you can withdraw 4 percent of your retirement corpus in the first year, adjust that amount for inflation every year after, and expect the money to last around 30 years.\nIt’s a useful starting point, but it has limitations.\nFirst, it was developed using US market data and assumes a specific mix of equity and debt. Second, it was designed for a 30-year retirement, not for someone retiring early or expecting to live into their 90s. Third, it assumes you stick rigidly to the rule even during bad years, which is rarely how real people behave.\nFor many retirees, especially outside the US or those retiring early, 4 percent may be optimistic.\nA more conservative starting range\nFor long retirements, many planners prefer starting closer to 3 to 3.5 percent. That may feel low, but it builds in a margin of safety.\nFor example, on a Rs 2 crore corpus, a 3.5 percent withdrawal means Rs 7 lakh a year, or about Rs 58,000 a month, before tax. That amount then rises gradually with inflation, assuming the portfolio supports it.\nThis approach gives your investments more room to grow and recover from market downturns.\nYour asset mix changes the answer\nWithdrawal rates are not independent of how your money is invested.\nIf most of your corpus sits in fixed deposits or low-yield debt, your sustainable withdrawal rate is lower because returns barely beat inflation. If your portfolio includes a reasonable equity allocation, the money has a better chance of growing over time, supporting higher long-term withdrawals.\nThat said, higher equity exposure also means higher short-term volatility. The solution is not avoiding equity entirely, but structuring withdrawals so you are not forced to sell equity during market crashes.\nMany retirees use a bucket approach: short-term expenses in cash and debt, and long-term money in equity.\nSpending does not stay flat in real life\nOne assumption that rarely holds is that expenses rise steadily with inflation forever.\nIn reality, spending often follows a curve. Early retirement can be expensive, with travel and lifestyle spending. Mid-retirement may be calmer. Later years may see healthcare costs rise, but discretionary spending often falls.\nA rigid inflation-linked withdrawal every year may not match how you actually live. Being willing to spend a little less in bad market years and a little more in good ones greatly improves sustainability.\nFlexibility is one of the most underrated retirement assets.\nTaxes and healthcare matter more than people expect\nWithdrawals are not just about headline numbers. Taxes can materially reduce what you actually receive, especially if most income comes from interest or taxable withdrawals.\nHealthcare costs are another wildcard. Even with insurance, out-of-pocket expenses tend to rise with age. A safe withdrawal plan always assumes higher medical spending later, not just average inflation.\nSo how do you decide what’s safe?\nA practical way to approach this is: Start conservatively in the first few years, especially if markets are expensive or volatile. Keep at least two to three years of expenses in safer assets so you are not forced to sell equity in a downturn. Review withdrawals annually instead of locking yourself into a fixed rule. And be honest about how flexible your spending really is.\nThere is no perfect withdrawal rate. But a cautious start, combined with sensible investing and periodic adjustment, does far more to protect your retirement than chasing an extra half-percent of income in the early years.\nIn retirement, longevity is the goal. The money just needs to last as long as you do.",

        "full_content": "On paper, Rs 2.5 crore sounds like a solid cushion to have if you are planning your retirement in your 20s, but the question to ask yourself isn’t whether the money is enough today, it’s whether it can keep doing the job year after year, for possibly half a century.\nThat’s where things get tricky.\nWhy the “FD-only” approach feels right but often isn’t\nFixed deposits are a safe option for most Indians. There’s little risk and predictable returns. When you’re already dealing with health issues or uncertainty, that predictability helps.\nThe problem is that life doesn’t stay still. Prices rise, medical costs creep up, and what feels manageable at 27 can look very different at 47 or 67. Your 6 percent FD return will not be able to stand up against inflation, and over time, withdrawals start cutting into the core of the corpus. And you will realise a little too late that the money isn’t stretching as far as you thought it would.\nStop looking at the corpus as one big number\nA more realistic way to plan is to break the money into parts, each with a clear purpose.\nUse one part of the money for stable returns. This is where FDs make sense. For example, putting around Rs 1.5 crore into FDs can give a steady annual income of roughly Rs 9 lakh at current rates. With some effort, such as spreading deposits across banks or choosing longer tenures, you might even be able to nudge it up a bit. Keeping some money in liquid funds helps handle surprises without panic.\nThis part of the money is about peace of mind.\nLet some money quietly work harder\nThen there’s the portion that needs to grow, but without giving you sleepless nights. Balanced advantage funds often fit here because they don’t force you to make constant decisions. They move between equity and debt on their own, depending on market conditions.\nPutting, say, Rs 50 lakh into such funds isn’t about chasing returns. It’s about giving the overall portfolio a gentle push so inflation doesn’t slowly eat away at it.\nWhy avoiding equity completely can backfire\nIt’s understandable to want zero exposure to equity when you’re no longer earning. But over a very long retirement, inflation becomes a bigger threat than market volatility.\nA small allocation to diversified equity funds, maybe another Rs 50 lakh, gives the portfolio some long-term strength. This money isn’t meant for everyday expenses or emergencies. It’s there so that ten or twenty years down the line, your lifestyle doesn’t have to shrink simply because prices have risen.\nThe key is keeping this slice small enough that market swings don’t cause anxiety.\nKeep things flexible\nNo plan made today should be locked in forever. Every few years, it helps to take stock. If equity has done well, move some gains into safer options. If expenses rise or health needs change, adjust accordingly.\nAnd one thing that’s non-negotiable in an early retirement: solid health insurance. No investment plan can compensate for large, unexpected medical bills.\nThe simple takeaway\nRs 2.5 crore can support an early retirement, but only if the money is allowed to do different things at the same time. Putting everything into fixed deposits may feel safe, but over decades, it quietly increases the risk of the money falling short.\nA mix of stability, some growth, and a little long-term risk is usually what helps the money last, not just look reassuring on day one.",

        "full_content": "Many people with serious long-term ailments like diabetes, thyroid issues, hypertension, asthma, or a past surgery, find buying health insurance daunting. You assume that you will either get rejected outright or charged outrageous premiums. And so you delay buying health insurance altogether, which usually makes things worse.\nThe truth is, you can get insured with a pre-existing medical condition, but how easy it will be for you depends on the timing, your health disclosure, and your expectations.\nFirst, what insurers mean by “pre-existing”\nAccording to insurers, a pre-existing medical condition means that you have had an illness, injury, or condition and you displayed symptoms, were diagnosed, and received medical treatment for before buying the policy. This includes conditions that you may be taking medication for or are managing routinely and not just serious illnesses.\nWhat matters is not how severe the condition feels to you, but whether it existed before the policy started. This definition is standard across insurers and is regulated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India.\nDisclosure is non-negotiable\nThis is the most important part, and also where many people go wrong. You must disclose everything you know about your medical history, even if it feels minor or under control.\nSkipping information to get a cheaper premium or faster approval can backfire badly. If a claim arises later and the insurer finds non-disclosure, they are within their rights to reject the claim or even cancel the policy.\nA good rule of thumb is simple. If a doctor has ever diagnosed it, prescribed medication for it, or advised follow-ups, disclose it.\nExpect waiting periods, not instant coverage\nMost health insurance policies come with a waiting period for pre-existing conditions. This is usually between two and four years, depending on the insurer and the plan.\nDuring this waiting period, expenses related to the declared condition are not covered. However, hospitalisation for unrelated illnesses or accidents is typically covered once the initial waiting period is over.\nThis is why buying insurance early matters. The clock on the waiting period starts only after the policy begins. The longer you wait to buy insurance, the later that clock starts ticking.\nPremium loading and exclusions are common\nIf you have a pre-existing condition, insurers may charge a higher premium. This is called premium loading. In some cases, they may also place permanent exclusions on very specific complications linked to the condition.\nThis does not mean the policy is useless. It simply reflects the insurer’s assessment of risk. What’s important is to understand what is excluded and what is covered, rather than focusing only on the price.\nAlways ask for these terms in writing before you buy.\nChoose the right type of policy\nWhen you have a pre-existing condition, a comprehensive individual or family floater policy is usually better than very cheap or limited-cover plans. Avoid policies with extremely low premiums and unusually high promises, as they often come with tighter conditions.\nIf employer-provided insurance is available, keep it active even if you buy your own policy. Group policies usually have no waiting period for pre-existing diseases, which makes them extremely valuable.\nSenior citizen policies and disease-specific plans are also options in certain cases, but they tend to be more expensive and restrictive.\nMedical tests are normal, not a red flag\nMany insurers will ask for medical tests before issuing a policy if you declare a condition. This is standard practice and not a rejection signal.\nThe test results help the insurer decide the premium, waiting period, or exclusions. Cooperating fully and getting these tests done early speeds up the process and reduces surprises later.\nRenewals matter more than the first year\nOnce your policy is issued, renew it on time every year. Continuity is critical. If you let the policy lapse and restart later, waiting periods may reset, and terms may change.\nOver time, as waiting periods end, coverage improves. Many people only start seeing the real value of their policy several years in, which is exactly why consistency matters.\nThe bottom line\nHaving a pre-existing condition does not disqualify you from health insurance. It just means you need to buy early, disclose honestly, read the fine print carefully, and stay invested in the policy long term.\nHealth insurance in this situation is not about finding the “perfect” policy. It is about reducing risk, avoiding catastrophic expenses, and making sure that when you do need care, cost is not the first thing you have to worry about.",

        "full_content": "Most parents don’t enjoy thinking about estate planning. For parents of children with special needs, it’s even heavier. The questions aren’t abstract or financial in the usual sense. They’re deeply personal.\nWho will look after my child when I can’t?\nWho will make decisions if I’m not there to explain things?\nHow do I make sure my child is safe, supported and not treated like a burden?\nThere are no perfect answers, but there are ways to reduce uncertainty.\nDon’t assume money alone will solve the problem\nOne of the most common instincts parents have is to make sure their child “gets enough money”. That instinct comes from love, but money on its own rarely solves the real issue.\nLeaving assets directly to a child with special needs can create complications. Managing money may be difficult. The funds may be misused, even unintentionally. In some cases, a direct inheritance can interfere with government benefits or other forms of support.\nEstate planning here isn’t about generosity. It’s about structure.\nWill is necessary, but it’s rarely enough\nA basic will answers one question: who owns what after you’re gone.\nWhat it doesn’t answer is how money should be used over time, who decides what is in your child’s best interest, or how care is coordinated year after year. That’s why parents in this situation usually need more than a will.\nThink of the will as the starting point, not the solution.\nWhy do many parents turn to trusts\nFor families with special-needs dependents, a trust often becomes the anchor of the plan.\nInstead of leaving assets directly to the child, assets are placed in a trust. The trust is managed by trustees you choose, with clear instructions on how money should be used — for care, therapy, housing, education, or daily living.\nThe real benefit isn’t control. It’s continuity. A trust can outlast you, adapt to changing needs, and protect your child from financial chaos or well-meaning but misguided decisions.\nMany parents also find comfort in knowing the money is ringfenced — it’s there for the child, not at the mercy of circumstance.\nTrustees matter more than paperwork\nThis is where plans quietly succeed or fail.\nChoosing a trustee isn’t about seniority or obligation. It’s about temperament, reliability and willingness. The role can last decades. Not everyone is suited for that, and that’s okay.\nOften, a mix works best: someone who knows your child well, paired with someone who understands money and compliance. And it’s wise to name backups. Life changes. Your plan should survive those changes.\nBe explicit about caregiving, not just finances\nMoney without clarity about care creates stress for everyone involved.\nWho will your child live with?\nWho will make medical decisions?\nWho will coordinate daily routines, therapies, and emergencies?\nThese roles shouldn’t be assumed. They should be discussed openly, agreed to willingly, and written down clearly. This is especially important when siblings are involved, because unspoken expectations can turn into resentment later.\nWrite the document only you can write\nAlongside legal documents, many parents leave something far more personal: a letter of intent.\nThis isn’t about law. It’s about life. It explains your child’s routines, preferences, fears, comforts, medical history, communication style and emotional needs. It tells future caregivers what works and what doesn’t.\nIt’s often the document people reach for first, long before they open a trust deed.\nAccept that this plan will need revisiting\nYour child’s needs will change. Policies will change. Family dynamics will change.\nEstate plans for families with special needs aren’t “set and forget”. They need to be reviewed more often than standard plans, not because something is wrong, but because life keeps moving.\nRevisiting the plan is part of caring.\nOne quiet truth\nEstate planning for parents of children with special needs isn’t about predicting everything perfectly. It’s about reducing avoidable uncertainty and leaving behind guidance, not just assets.\nDone thoughtfully, it’s less about control — and more about continuing care, even when you’re no longer there to provide it yourself.\nFAQs",

        "full_content": "Almost everyone believes OTP scams happen to “other people”. People who are careless. People who don’t understand phones. And then one day, someone perfectly sensible gets a call, a message, or a link, and things go wrong in under two minutes.\nThat’s the uncomfortable truth about OTP theft. It doesn’t rely on stupidity. It relies on normal human behaviour.\nAn OTP feels routine now. You get them for everything. Logging in. Making payments. Updating details. Verifying something that didn’t work the first time. So when an OTP arrives, your brain often treats it like background noise rather than a serious security step.\nAnd that’s exactly what scammers count on.\nHow it usually starts in real life\nOTP scams rarely start with anything dramatic. They start with something ordinary. A call saying a delivery couldn’t be completed. A message saying a payment failed. A warning that your account might be blocked if you don’t act. Sometimes it’s framed as help. Sometimes, as an urgency. Sometimes both.\nWhat makes it worse is that the person on the other end often sounds calm and informed. They may know your name. They may know which app or bank you use. That familiarity lowers your guard just enough.\nThen the OTP arrives.\nYou’re told it’s needed to “verify”, “reverse”, or “stop” something. That wording matters. It makes sharing the OTP feel like the safe choice. Like you’re preventing a problem.\nYou’re not.\nThe OTP is not a cancellation tool. It is an approval.\nOnce it’s shared or typed in the wrong place, the system assumes you meant to authorise whatever happens next.\nWhen no one even asks for your OTP\nNot all OTP theft involves a call. Some of the most common cases happen silently.\nYou get a message with a link that looks genuine. You click it because you’re busy or distracted. It asks you to log in. An OTP comes. You enter it. That’s it.\nAnother common situation involves screen sharing. Someone says they’ll “guide” you through a fix. You install an app. You allow screen access. From that point on, every OTP that pops up is visible to them in real time.\nSometimes the mistake is even smaller. Installing an app quickly and tapping “allow” on all permissions without reading them. An app that can read notifications doesn’t need you to share an OTP. It can see it arrive.\nWhat actually helps, day to day\nThere isn’t a clever trick that makes you immune. What helps is a mindset shift.\nTreat every OTP like a house key. If someone else has it, even briefly, you assume the house is no longer secure.\nIf an OTP arrives when you weren’t actively doing something inside an official app or website you opened yourself, stop. Don’t explain. Don’t argue. Don’t “just check once”. Stop.\nDon’t click links that ask you to fix accounts, refunds, or KYC. If there’s really a problem, it will show up when you open the app directly.\nDon’t install apps or enable screen sharing because someone on a call told you to. No genuine service needs to see your screen to help you.\nAnd most importantly, slow things down. Almost every OTP scam depends on urgency. The moment you pause, the scam starts to fall apart.\nIf you think you slipped up\nIf you realise you may have shared an OTP or entered it somewhere shady, don’t wait to see what happens. Act as if access has already been compromised. Block cards. Alert the bank or app. Change passwords. Watch transactions.\nPeople lose more money by hesitating than by making the initial mistake.\nOTP scams work because they fit neatly into everyday digital life. Protecting yourself is less about being tech-savvy and more about refusing to rush when someone else wants you to.\nFAQs",

        "full_content": "Extra money shows up in your account and the question arrives almost immediately. Should you throw it at your loan and get rid of some debt, or should you invest it and hope it grows faster?\nThere’s no single right answer. Anyone telling you otherwise is oversimplifying a very personal decision.\nThe smarter way to look at it is to understand when prepaying makes sense and when investing quietly does a better job.\nWhy prepaying a loan feels so satisfying\nThere’s something deeply reassuring about reducing a loan. The EMI stays the same, but the tenure shortens. Interest drops. The loan statement looks lighter.\nFor many people, this peace of mind matters more than spreadsheets. And sometimes, that instinct is absolutely right.\nIf your loan interest rate is high, especially personal loans,  credit cards, or older home loans taken at double-digit rates, prepaying is often the best use of surplus cash. Very few investments can reliably beat those rates after tax.\nThere’s also the emotional benefit. Fewer obligations mean more breathing room if income becomes uncertain. That safety has value, even if it doesn’t show up neatly in return calculations.\nWhen prepaying clearly makes sense\nPrepayment usually wins if your loan interest is significantly higher than what you can realistically earn elsewhere. Not theoretical market returns, but what you are likely to earn, consistently, after tax.\nIt also makes sense if you’re already stretched. If EMIs eat into your sleep, or one income disruption would throw things off badly, reducing debt is risk management, not conservatism.\nAnother situation where prepayment helps is when retirement is approaching and income visibility reduces. Carrying large loans into your late 50s or 60s increases vulnerability. In that phase, stability often beats maximising returns.\nWhen investing can quietly do better\nNow comes the uncomfortable part. Sometimes prepaying feels responsible, but isn’t the most efficient move.\nIf you’re on a low-interest home loan and you’re in the early or middle stages of your career, investing surplus money can often work out better over time. Especially if your loan rate is lower than long-term inflation-adjusted returns from equity or balanced investments.\nThis doesn’t mean chasing aggressive returns. It means recognising that money invested for 10 or 15 years has time to recover from market ups and downs, while loan interest remains fixed and predictable.\nThere’s also liquidity to consider. Once money goes into loan prepayment, it’s gone. You can’t pull it out easily if you need cash later. Investments, even conservative ones, usually give you more flexibility.\nThe tax angle people forget\nTaxes change the math more than people realise.\nHome loan interest deductions reduce the effective cost of the loan for many borrowers. On the other hand, investment returns are taxed too, sometimes heavily depending on the product and holding period.\nSo the comparison should always be after tax, not headline numbers. A loan at 8 percent with tax benefits may not be as expensive as it looks. An investment promising 10 percent may not deliver that post-tax.\nIgnoring this is one of the most common mistakes in the prepay-versus-invest debate.\nThe hybrid approach that works for most people\nIn real life, the answer often isn’t either-or.\nMany people do better by splitting surplus money. Part of it goes towards modest prepayment, reducing stress and interest. The rest goes into investments aligned with long-term goals.\nThis approach avoids extremes. You’re not betting everything on markets, and you’re not locking all liquidity into bricks and EMIs either.\nIt also helps psychologically. You feel progress on both fronts, which makes it easier to stay consistent.\nThe question that matters more than returns\nInstead of asking “Which gives higher returns?”, a better question is “What problem am I trying to solve?”\nIf the problem is anxiety, income uncertainty, or nearing retirement, prepayment often wins. If the problem is long-term wealth creation and you have time on your side, investing deserves more weight.\nMoney decisions aren’t made in isolation. They sit inside careers, families, health, and temperament. A choice that looks suboptimal on paper can still be the right one for a particular household.\nThe real mistake to avoid\nThe worst outcome isn’t choosing prepayment or investing. It’s doing nothing because the decision feels complicated.\nLetting surplus cash sit idle while you overthink the choice quietly costs more than either option.\nDecide, act, review. You can always adjust later. What matters is that your money is working in a direction that matches your life, not someone else’s formula.\nIn the end, the best decision is the one you can live with, stick to, and not regret when circumstances change.",

        "full_content": "For many Indian families, studying abroad is simply out of reach without borrowing. Once you add tuition, rent, insurance, travel, and basic living costs, savings rarely cover it. Banks are aware of this and are often quite willing to fund overseas education, especially for familiar universities and destinations. That willingness can feel reassuring, but it shouldn’t replace your own judgement.\nThink about repayment before anything else\nMost loan conversations begin with eligibility and how much money can be sanctioned. That’s the easy part. The harder part is repayment. Education loans usually come with a moratorium during the course and a short grace period after graduation. Once that ends, EMIs start on schedule, regardless of whether the student has found steady work. Many families assume the first job will come quickly and pay well enough. When that doesn’t happen, the loan turns into a constant source of anxiety.\nTax benefits exist, but they don’t ease monthly stress\nInterest on education loans qualifies for a deduction under Section 80E, which does reduce the total cost over time. But it doesn’t lower the EMI, and it only helps if the borrower is earning enough to actually use the deduction. Early career income is often uneven, especially for those on temporary roles or internships. In those years, the tax benefit looks good on paper but doesn’t help with cash flow.\nEmployment prospects matter more than the university name\nThe biggest risk with an education loan isn’t academic performance, it’s employability. Job markets, visa rules, post-study work options, and demand for specific skills vary sharply by country and course. A well-ranked university does not automatically lead to a job offer. Some destinations offer clear work pathways after graduation, others don’t. This uncertainty is why bodies like the Reserve Bank of India have repeatedly cautioned against borrowing heavily based purely on expected future income.\nCurrency risk is easy to underestimate\nMany students assume they will repay their loan from foreign earnings. In reality, plans change. People return to India, move countries, or take time off. If repayments end up coming from rupee income, exchange rates start to matter. A weaker rupee quietly increases the burden of a loan taken for overseas education, sometimes by more than families expect.\nCollateral means the family is involved\nLarge education loans often require collateral or a parent as co-borrower. That means the risk doesn’t sit only with the student. Missed payments can affect family credit records or put assets under pressure. This shared responsibility deserves an honest conversation upfront, not a rushed signature at the bank.\nThe takeaway\nAn education loan isn’t automatically a mistake, but it isn’t a simple decision either. Approval is easy to celebrate. Repayment is where reality shows up. Taking the time to think about job prospects, early income, currency risk, and the impact on the family can make the difference between a manageable loan and years of financial strain.",

        "full_content": "Before marriage, money is usually a personal problem. You earn, spend, save, or struggle on your own terms. After marriage, money becomes shared terrain, even if accounts stay separate. Decisions ripple. Habits collide. Things you could ignore earlier suddenly have consequences.\nWays marriage can help financially\nLiving together is usually cheaper than living apart. Housing costs, utilities, internet plans, groceries, and subscriptions tend to drop per person without anyone actively trying to save. It’s not dramatic, but it’s real.\nMarriage also nudges people into thinking longer-term. Buying a home, planning for children, or saving for later life stops being a vague idea and becomes a practical question. That shift alone can make people more disciplined with money.\nCredit access often improves. Two incomes generally look safer to banks than one. That can translate into higher eligibility or smoother approvals for large loans,  especially housing loans.\nThere’s also an income cushion. If one person loses a job, takes a break, or faces illness, the household may not immediately fall off a cliff financially. It doesn’t remove stress, but it can soften the blow.\nInsurance decisions become clearer. Life cover, health insurance, and nominations are easier to structure when there’s a legally recognised relationship. In emergencies, clarity matters more than clever planning.\nMarriage can also force financial honesty. Shared expenses mean conversations you could postpone earlier now have to happen. For many couples, that leads to better awareness of where money is actually going.\nFinally, some administrative things do get simpler. Claims, nominations, and succession tend to involve fewer grey areas once there’s a clear family structure.\nFinancial risks people don’t think about enough\nMoney habits don’t merge just because people do. If one person saves and the other spends, that gap usually widens unless it’s addressed early. What starts as tolerance often turns into resentment.\nShared financial commitments carry shared risk. Joint loans, guarantees, or even informal financial dependence mean one person’s mistake can affect both lives, sometimes for years.\nMarriage can quietly shrink financial independence. When one partner controls most decisions or access to money, imbalance creeps in. This becomes especially dangerous during career breaks, caregiving years, or periods without income.\nThe hardest risk to face is separation. Divorce or long-term separation has real financial costs, not just emotional ones. Legal fees, divided assets, disrupted income, and long recovery periods are common. Avoiding the topic doesn’t make it disappear.\nThe takeaway\nMarriage doesn’t change your relationship with money overnight. It just removes the hiding places. When couples talk early, stay honest, and respect each other’s autonomy, money becomes manageable. When it’s avoided, controlled, or assumed to “sort itself out”, it usually shows up later in more painful ways.",

        "full_content": "Most people take a joint home loan because it makes the numbers work. Two incomes improve eligibility and the EMI feels lighter when shared. That part is straightforward. What’s less obvious is how much responsibility comes with it, and how hard it can be to change things later.\nYou’re both responsible, no matter who pays\nBanks don’t split responsibility the way people do at home. If there are two borrowers, both are fully responsible for the loan.  It doesn’t matter whose account the EMI comes from or who earns more. If payments stop, the bank can recover the full amount from either person.\nMake sure the ownership matches the loan\nIdeally, anyone paying the EMI should also be an owner of the property. When someone is on the loan but not on the sale deed, problems tend to show up later. Tax benefits get complicated and legal rights over the house may be limited. Paying for a home you don’t legally own can leave you exposed.Q\nTax benefits aren’t automatic\nIn a joint loan, tax benefits depend on ownership and actual payment. To claim deductions, you need to be a co-owner, a co-borrower, and you should be contributing to the EMI. Just having your name on the loan isn’t enough if the payments don’t reflect that.\nYour credit records move together\nA joint home loan shows up on both credit reports. When EMIs are paid on time, both scores benefit. When they’re delayed, both take a hit. If one person already has a weak credit history, it can affect loan terms for the other. This matters even more today, with lenders following tighter risk rules set by regulators like the Reserve Bank of India.\nExiting isn’t easy\nIt’s easy to take a joint loan. Getting out is another story. If one person wants to step away, the other has to qualify to take over the loan alone or the property has to be sold. There’s no simple process to remove a name just because circumstances have changed.\nHave the awkward money conversations\nA home loan can run for 20 years or more. During that time, careers change, incomes fluctuate, and priorities shift. Talking early about who pays what, what happens during a career break, or what to do if someone wants to sell can feel uncomfortable. But skipping these conversations often leads to bigger issues later.\nThe takeaway\nA joint home loan isn’t a bad idea. It just needs clarity. Understanding the responsibility you’re taking on, how exits work, and how money will be handled makes it much easier to live with the decision in the long run.",

The good news is that credit scores are not permanent labels. They respond to behaviour. The bad news is that quick fixes don’t work. What does work is fixing the few things that matter most, and doing them consistently.\nHere are five moves that make the biggest difference.\nPay every bill on time, no exceptions\nThis sounds obvious, but it’s the most powerful lever you have. Late payments hurt more than almost anything else. Even a single missed credit card payment can drag your score down and keep it there for months. Set auto-debits. Keep a buffer in your account. If cash flow is tight, pay at least the minimum on time. Perfection matters more than amounts here.\nBring card usage down sharply\nHigh credit card utilisation is one of the fastest ways to keep a score stuck in the 500s or 600s. If you’re regularly using most of your limit, lenders read that as stress, even if you pay on time. Aim to use much less than your available limit. Paying down balances, even partially, can trigger visible score improvement within a few months.\nStop applying for new credit\nWhen your score is low, every new loan or card application works against you. Each enquiry chips away at your score and makes you look desperate for credit. Pause applications completely for a while. Focus on cleaning up existing accounts instead of adding new ones.\nFix errors on your credit report\nLow scores are often dragged down by mistakes. Closed loans still showing as active, payments wrongly marked late, or accounts that don’t belong to you at all. Check your credit report carefully. If something looks wrong, dispute it. Corrections can lead to sudden jumps that no budgeting trick will achieve.\nKeep old, clean accounts alive\nIf you have an older credit card or loan account with a clean history, don’t close it unless there’s a strong reason. Length of credit history matters. A long-running account with timely payments helps offset past damage and stabilises your score as it recovers.\nWhat “fast” really means\nGoing from 580 to 800 doesn’t happen in weeks. But visible improvement can start within three to six months if you’re consistent. The jump from “risky” to “acceptable” usually comes first. The climb from there to 800 is slower, but much smoother once the basics are fixed.\nThe bottom line\nA low credit score isn’t a character flaw. It’s a signal that something went off track. Fix the fundamentals, stop digging new holes, and give the system time to respond. Credit scores reward boring, predictable behaviour. If you stick to that, the number usually follows.",

        "full_content": "Indian stock markets have seen a sharp pullback from record highs. Both the Nifty 50 and Sensex have fallen over 4 percent in a week, unsettling many retail investors.\nThe Nifty 50 is down over 4 percent from its peak of 26,373.2, which it had hit on January 5, while the Sensex has fallen 4 percent from its high of 86,159.02 on December 1 last year. On January 20, the Nifty closed at 25,232, and the Sensex at 82,180, reflecting another day of losses in the market.\nAs markets turn volatile, a familiar question resurfaces: should you continue your SIPs or pause them until things settle down?\nFinancial advisors warn that this is exactly when most investors make costly mistakes when they stop SIPs, just as long-term wealth creation is about to take shape. Here’s why staying invested matters, and how to navigate SIPs during market corrections.\nLet’s explore the pitfalls, strategies, and mindset needed for SIP success.\nCommon reasons investors stop SIPs early\nMarket volatility tops the list, as short-term losses trigger fear and panic-selling during corrections, ignoring these are the very times when SIPs accumulate more units at lower prices.\nOther factors include comparing returns to trending assets or high-performing funds, cash-flow issues from job changes or expenses, and a lack of initial conviction about market cycles.\nLt Col Rochak Bakshi (retired), founder of True North Finance, a financial and investment planning firm said, “Recency bias, where investors chase recent highs, and loss aversion further exacerbate this, treating SIPs like short-term trades rather than disciplined investments. As a result, many exit just before the wealth-building phase begins.”\nThe High Cost of Quitting: Eroding gains through missed compounding\nQuitting early deprives investors of rupee-cost averaging in downturns and the compounding effect, which ramps up after 7-10 years. “SIPs thrive on time, not timing; early exits turn them into mediocre savings tools, locking in losses and forfeiting future growth,” said Vijay Maheshwari, founder of Stocktick Capital.\nConsider a Rs 75,000 monthly SIP at 15 percent CAGR: After 3 years, the total investment of Rs 27 lakhs yields Rs 34 lakhs, but continuing to 20 years builds Rs 9.97 crore on Rs 1.8 crore invested. Stopping at 3 years means an opportunity loss of Rs 9.63 crore; even stopping at 10 years (Rs 2 crore corpus), it's Rs 7.97 crore forgone.\n“Wealth creation is back-loaded—the first 7 years build a base, years 8-14 gain momentum, and the final phase explodes due to compounding on a larger sum. No timing or luck is needed; consistency alone drives this,” said Maheshwari.\nFor instance, a Rs 5,000 monthly SIP with 10 percent annual step-up and 12 percent returns grows to Rs 1.08 crore in 21 years. The investment phases show slow growth initially (Rs 8.37 lakh in 7 years), building momentum (Rs 34.81 lakh in 14 years), and exponential growth in the final phase (Rs 1.08 crore in 21 years).\nBoosting outcomes with step-up SIPs\nA step-up SIP increases contributions annually. For instance, for a Rs 5,000 starting SIP over 15 years at 12 percent returns, a conventional plan invests Rs 9 lakh for Rs 24 lakh maturity, while a 10 percent step-up invests Rs 15.3 lakh for Rs 36 lakh, a 50 percent boost.\nIdeal for salaried professionals or young earners, it suits late starters (e.g., age 45 with Rs 10,000 starting and 15 percent annual increase, yielding Rs 90 lakhs in 15 years) or those with small initial amounts.\n“However, it's unsuitable for self-employed individuals with inconsistent cash flows. Start in mid-30s when finances stabilize for maximum impact,” said Bakshi.\nAlso read | How NPS contributions cut your income tax under both old and new regimes\nPsychological barriers and advisor strategies\nImpatience for quick gains, especially in sideways markets, leads to exit within five years, as early modest returns erode confidence.\nSIP is a long-term concept and starts showing results only after 7 to 10 years. Most investors don't have the patience to stick to the process. “Frequent comparison with peers, market indices, or recently outperforming funds further weakens conviction and encourages premature exits,” said Maheshwari.\n“Successful SIP investing needs the investor to appreciate delayed gratification, which is a rare quality,” said Bakshi.\nAdvisors counter this by setting realistic expectations, explaining back-loaded returns, and communicating during dips to reframe them as opportunities.\nGoal-based planning ties investments to milestones like education or retirement, reducing short-term focus. “Automated step-ups, periodic reviews, and a behavioral guidance-based approach with hand-holding build discipline and prevent errors,” said Maheshwari.\nElements for turning SIPs into extraordinary wealth\nBeyond consistency, start early for exponential compounding, where later years generate most wealth. Gradually step up contributions, maintain asset allocation through rebalancing, and select quality funds with strong philosophies and risk management.\n“Uphold behavioral discipline by ignoring market noise, ensure cost and tax efficiency, and review portfolios regularly to align with goals,” said Maheshwari. These amplify outcomes without chasing high-risk returns.\nAlso read | Here is how to invest smartly if you earn Rs 1 lakh a month\nBuilding patience in volatile markets\nFor beginners, advisors recommend linking SIPs to goals (like buying a house) rather than focusing on returns, to handle market ups and downs. Automate investments, limit reviews to annually, and view volatility as a chance to buy low. Gradually increase amounts via step-ups, stay informed via credible sources without obsession, and remember compounding rewards endurance, not speed.",

        "full_content": "Inflows into mid-cap and small-cap mutual fund schemes touched record levels in 2025 despite sharp volatility in broader markets, the absence of foreign investors from these segments, stretched valuations, and muted earnings.\nAMFI data showed that mid-cap schemes received Rs 49,939 crore during the year, up 46 percent from a year earlier, while small-cap schemes attracted Rs 52,321 crore, an increase of 53 percent.\nMarket performance remained mixed during the period. The BSE MidCap index rose 1.1 percent in 2025, while the BSE SmallCap index declined 6.6 percent. In comparison, the Sensex and Nifty gained nearly 9 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively.\nAxis Securities’ Rajesh Palviya said the inflows were supported by steady SIP investments and investors continuing to add to their mutual fund holdings, based on the strong three-year and five-year outperformance of mid-cap and small-cap stocks over large-cap shares.\nMarket breadth stayed weak. Of the 140 stocks in the BSE MidCap index, 86 ended the year with negative returns, while in the BSE SmallCap index, 871 of the 1,186 stocks were in the red. In the BSE100 index, 61 stocks posted gains and 39 recorded losses.\nPalviya said investors have been using market declines to average their investments, as SIP inflows into mid-cap and small-cap schemes continue on a regular basis.\nDomestic investors have been the main source of net inflows over the past two years and have preferred mid-cap and small-cap schemes over large-cap funds. Foreign investors have largely stayed away from these segments and have mainly been selling large-cap stocks, which has further concentrated domestic flows into mid-cap and small-cap schemes.\nThe share of mid-cap and small-cap schemes in total equity inflows also increased during the year. Mid-cap funds accounted for a record 14.26 percent of total equity inflows, up from 8.7 percent in 2024 and 14.18 percent in 2023. Small-cap funds also saw their share rise to a two-year high of 14.26 percent, compared with 8.68 percent in 2024 and 25.4 percent in 2023.\nTotal equity inflows for the year stood at Rs 3.51 lakh crore, down 11.19 percent from Rs 3.94 lakh crore in 2024 and Rs 1.62 lakh crore in 2023.\nAnalysts said the absence of outflows despite nearly 16 months of muted returns indicates continued investor commitment. They said many investors remain focused on a three- to four-year horizon, even as near-term returns have been weak, while investment in assets such as gold and silver at current elevated prices is harder to justify for long-term allocations.\nIndependent research analyst Ambreesh Baliga said inflows into mutual funds are likely to continue going ahead as mid-cap and small-cap funds have delivered better results than individual portfolios. While many individual portfolios are down 20 percent to 30 percent or more, he said even the worst-performing mid-cap and small-cap funds were down only about 5 percent to 6 percent as of the end of December.\nBaliga said investor interest remains as long as losses are limited. He added that when losses become large, investors stop averaging, liquidity in the secondary market declines, selling pressure rises, and stocks can fall further, sometimes leading to margin calls.",

        "full_content": "The Indian mutual fund industry’s assets under management (AUM) eased slightly to about Rs 80.2 lakh crore in December 2025, down from Rs 80.8 lakh crore in November, reflecting the impact of volatile markets and foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows. Market benchmarks mirrored this cautious sentiment, with the Sensex and Nifty slipping 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively, while broader indices also fell—the BSE MidCap declined 0.5% and the BSE SmallCap dropped 1.01%.\nDespite this overall dip, equity mutual funds, flexi-cap funds, and gold ETFs continued to attract strong investor interest, highlighting sustained confidence in long-term market opportunities. Equity mutual funds recorded net inflows of Rs 28,054 crore for the month, marking the 58th consecutive month of positive equity flows.\nHere are some of the key highlights\nRobust retail participation\nRetail participation remained strong, with 26.4 lakh new folios added during December, taking the total number of folios in the industry to 26.12 crore. In December, 23 open-ended schemes mobilised a combined Rs 4,074 crore. Equity-oriented funds led both in launches and collections, raising Rs 3,568 crore, including the highest collection of Rs 2,468 crore by Abakkus Flexi Cap Fund. Hybrid schemes attracted Rs 302 crore, while the sole debt fund, Abakkus Liquid Fund, raised Rs 34 crore. Other schemes, including 15 index funds and ETFs, garnered Rs 170 crore.\nRetail MF folios across Equity, Hybrid, and Solution Oriented schemes increased to 20,27,86,198 in December 2025, compared with 20,15,85,661 in November 2025, indicating steady growth in retail participation. Correspondingly, Retail AUM for these segments stood at Rs 47.36 lakh crore as of December 2025, highlighting sustained investor confidence and continued asset accumulation in the retail mutual fund space.\nFlexi-cap funds lead equity inflows\nFlexi-cap funds emerged as the standout category, recording a 23.2% month-on-month rise in inflows to Rs 10,019 crore, making them the largest contributor to equity flows for December. Himanshu Srivastava, Principal Research at Morningstar Investment Research India, said, “The moderation in flows could be attributed to cooling momentum in mid-cap and small-cap segments, where inflows tapered after a strong run-up in valuations and periodic market corrections. Investors are adopting a more selective and disciplined approach, balancing return expectations with valuation comfort. Market volatility has also prompted profit-booking during opportunistic moments.”\nSrivastava added, “The launch of the new Abakkus Flexi Cap Fund, which garnered net assets worth Rs 2,468 crore, boosted the overall inflow. The category continues to be the biggest beneficiary.”\nVaiibhavv Chugh, CEO of Abakkus Mutual Fund, noted, “Flexi-cap funds continue to be preferred as they allow inbuilt flexibility to maneuver across market caps. Large- and mid-cap funds are also relevant, given valuations in large caps are reaching comfortable levels. The industry-wide emphasis on asset allocation as a strategy to navigate volatility is clearly reflected in the growth of multi-asset allocation funds.”\nOther equity categories see mixed trends\nInflows in mid-cap and small-cap funds declined month-on-month by 6.9% and 13.2%, respectively, but remained robust at Rs 4,176 crore and Rs 3,824 crore. Large-cap funds and large-and-mid-cap funds saw declines of 4.4% and 9.1%, with inflows of Rs 1,567 crore and Rs 4,094 crore. ELSS funds recorded net outflows of Rs 718 crore, while dividend yield funds saw net outflows of Rs 254 crore.\nSuranjana Borthakur, Head of Distribution & Strategic Alliances at Mirae Asset Investment Managers (India), said, “With mid- and small-cap valuations appearing relatively expensive and market performance uneven, flexi-cap funds have emerged as a preferred option. These funds allow investors to adjust exposure across large, mid, and small-cap stocks, reducing the need for frequent allocation changes.”\nSectoral and thematic funds experienced the steepest decline, falling 49.3% month-on-month, though they still attracted Rs 946 crore. Borthakur explained, “The AMFI data shows a shift in investor preference toward broader, diversified categories. In 2024, elevated inflows into sectoral and thematic funds were driven largely by return chasing. Many investors have since recalibrated their approach, favoring balanced categories such as flexi-cap funds, which accounted for 23% of YTD net inflows in equity.”\nDebt mutual funds faced heavy redemptions, with net outflows exceeding Rs 1.2 lakh crore, led by liquid, money market, and short-duration funds. This was largely due to advance tax payments and quarter-end treasury withdrawals, a recurring pattern each fiscal quarter.\nHybrid funds, however, recorded net inflows of approximately Rs 10,756 crore, supported by strong interest in multi-asset allocation funds, which attracted Rs 7,426 crore—the highest in six months. Borthakur noted, “Within hybrid categories, a significant portion of inflows is directed toward arbitrage funds for short-term surplus deployment. Multi-asset funds have seen 30% of YTD inflows in hybrid, reflecting growing demand for diversified portfolios encompassing equity, debt, and commodities.”\nGold and passive funds continue to draw interest\nThe passive fund segment maintained momentum, with AUM reaching a record Rs 14.57 lakh crore. ETFs and index funds together saw Rs 26,723 crore in net inflows, driven largely by gold and silver ETFs.\nBorthakur said, “Gold has had an exceptional year, with net inflows into gold ETFs rising fourfold compared to last year. Gold is increasingly viewed not only as a hedge but as a strategic, long-term portfolio component.” In December, gold ETF inflows hit an all-time high of Rs 11,000 crore. Silver ETFs also drew strong interest, with inflows of Rs 3,962 crore, taking overall AUM to Rs 72,652 crore.\nSrivastava noted, “Strong gold price momentum through 2025, coupled with heightened safe-haven demand, has supported sustained investor interest. Indian investors increasingly view gold ETFs as a regulated, liquid, and cost-efficient alternative to physical gold, particularly during equity and bond market volatility. Steady allocations to gold ETFs, even amid market swings, underline their role as a strategic hedge and diversification tool.”\nSIP inflows reach record levels\nSystematic Investment Plan (SIP) inflows reached an all-time high of Rs 31,002 crore in December. SIP assets stood at Rs 16.63 lakh crore, accounting for 20.7% of total AUM, while contributing accounts rose to 9.79 crore, up from 9.43 crore in November.\nDuring December, 60.46 lakh new SIPs were registered, up from 57.13 lakh in November, while 51.57 lakh SIPs were discontinued or matured, compared with around 43 lakh in the previous month. This pushed the SIP stoppage ratio to 85%, up from 75.56% in November.\nSIF segment continues growth\nStrategic Investment Funds (SIFs) also gained traction, with AUM rising to Rs 4,892 crore from Rs 2,932 crore. The category saw inflows of Rs 1,933 crore, with hybrid strategies attracting Rs 1,571 crore, reflecting investor interest in structured, diversified investment approaches.",

        "full_content": "SEBI has decided to cut mutual fund base expense ratios making investing cheaper and more transparent for retail investors. The cut may look small at first glance, but it decides how much of your money actually stays invested instead of being eaten away by costs. Over time, that difference quietly adds up.\nUnder the new rules approved at SEBI’s board meeting on Wednesday, December 17 2025, expense ratios have been reduced by up to 15 basis points, with most asset slabs seeing a 10 basis point cut. For open-ended equity funds with assets below Rs 500 crore, the maximum charge has been lowered from 2.25 percent to 2.10 percent, while debt funds in the same category will now be capped at 1.85 percent .\nList of updated MF Expense Ratios\n1. Index funds/Exchange Traded Funds (ETF)\nCurrent (Including statutory levies) — 1.00 percent\nRevised (excluding statutory levies) — 0.90 percent\n2. Fund of Funds (FoFs)\nFunds investing in liquid schemes/index funds/ETFs\nCurrent (including statutory levies) — 1.00 percent\nRevised (excluding statutory levies) — 0.90 percent\nFunds investing ≥ 65 percent of AUM in equity-oriented schemes\nCurrent (including statutory levies) — 2.25 percent\nRevised (excluding statutory levies) — 2.10 percent\nOther FoFs\nCurrent (including statutory levies) — 2.00 percent\nRevised (excluding statutory levies) — 1.85 percent\nWhat Exactly Has Changed\nSEBI has also simplified how these charges are shown to investors. The Total Expense Ratio (TER) has been renamed the Base Expense Ratio (BER).\n“Earlier, investors tracked costs through the Total Expense Ratio (TER), which combined multiple expense components into a single figure. The move to a Base Expense Ratio (BER) separates core fund expenses from statutory levies, making the cost structure easier to understand and monitor over time,” says Niharika Tripathi, Head of Products and Research at Wealthy.in, a wealth management platform.\nThe BER will now include only the costs of running the fund, such as fund management fees, distributor commissions, and registrar and transfer agent (RTA) charges. Statutory costs like GST, stamp duty, Securities Transaction Tax (STT), Commodity Transaction Tax (CTT), and regulatory or exchange fees will be kept outside the BER and shown separately.\nIn simple terms, BER reflects what the fund house charges, while TER represents the final cost an investor pays after adding taxes and statutory levies. The revised limits apply across equity-oriented schemes, debt funds, index funds, ETFs, fund of funds, and closed-ended schemes.\nAlso read | National Pension System Update: Govt subscribers can withdraw full corpus up to Rs 8 lakh; entry and exit age raised to 85\nWhy A Small Cut Can Still Matter\nSo what does this mean for an investor’s savings?\nSEBI’s move to lower expense ratios by 10-20 basis points may appear marginal, but its impact builds quietly over time.\n“On the surface, a 10-20 bps cut looks negligible. But investing is not a sprint; it is a long, steady march. When these costs come down, more of your invested money stays invested and compounds more,” explains Col Sanjeev Govila (retd), Certified Financial Planner, CEO, Hum Fauji Initiatives, a financial advisory firm.\nLet’s understand this with an example. Here is the impact on a Rs 10 Lakh lump sum investment growing at a hypothetical 12 percent CAGR (pre-expenses):\nA 20-basis point reduction in expense ratio on a Rs 10 lakh portfolio over a 20-year period can translate into nearly Rs 2.95 lakh of additional wealth. This amount represents the net gain for the investor, arising purely from lower costs.\nGovila points out, “It is not an incremental return generated by market performance, but money that remains invested and compounds over time instead of being deducted as expenses. In essence, it is a direct saving that converts into higher long-term earnings through compounding.”\nAlso read | Will home-loan relief continue in 2026 after 125 bps repo rate cuts in 2025?\nThe Long-Term Effect\nGovila adds, “Every rupee saved from fees is an extra bullet available to fight the ‘demon’ of inflation. And these small numbers gain a bigger halo if we look at a 20bps cut as a 10-15 percent cost cut.”\nIn the short term, these savings are barely noticeable. But over long holding periods, they steadily improve outcomes. Over decades, such “small” reductions can make a meaningful difference to long-term goals.",

        "needs_deep_fetch": true,
        "full_content": "The debate between direct and regular mutual funds often gets reduced to a simple math problem. Direct funds are cheaper, so they must be better. Regular funds cost more, so they must be worse. In real life, the choice is not that clean. The right option depends less on expense ratios and more on how you make decisions, how disciplined you are, and whether advice actually changes your behaviour for the better.\nWhat really separates direct and regular funds\nBoth direct and regular mutual funds invest in the same underlying portfolio. The difference lies in how you access them. Direct funds are bought straight from the fund house or through platforms that do not offer advice. Regular funds are bought through distributors or advisors, and their commission is built into the expense ratio.\nThat commission is why regular funds have higher costs. Over long periods, this difference compounds and can reduce returns meaningfully. On paper, direct funds almost always win on pure return numbers.\nWhy lower cost is not the full story\nCost matters, but behaviour matters more. Many investors switch funds frequently, chase performance, stop SIPs during market falls, or panic when headlines turn negative. These mistakes can wipe out far more value than the cost difference between direct and regular plans.\nFor an investor who is confident, disciplined, and comfortable making allocation decisions, direct funds usually make sense. You save on costs, stay invested, and do not need hand-holding. But for someone who tends to react emotionally or gets overwhelmed by choices, the presence of a good advisor can actually improve outcomes, even after accounting for higher costs.\nThe role of advice in regular funds\nRegular funds are not inherently bad. They become expensive only when the advice adds no value. A competent advisor does more than recommend funds. They help with asset allocation, prevent knee-jerk reactions, align investments with goals, and act as a buffer between you and market noise.\nIf an advisor is genuinely involved in reviews, rebalancing, and goal tracking, the extra cost may be justified. If the interaction is limited to an occasional message or a one-time recommendation, the cost becomes harder to defend.\nWhen direct funds usually work better\nDirect funds tend to suit investors who have a clear plan and the temperament to stick to it. If you already know how to structure your portfolio, rebalance periodically, and ignore short-term noise, direct plans are a logical choice. They are also suitable if you enjoy tracking your investments and are willing to spend time learning.\nMany long-term SIP investors who invest in a small set of diversified funds and rarely change strategy find direct funds efficient and cost-effective.\nWhen regular funds can still make sense\nRegular funds can be useful for first-time investors, families with complex goals, or people who know they are likely to make emotional decisions during market stress. They can also work well for retirees or near-retirees who value guidance over squeezing out the last bit of return.\nThe key is accountability. If you are paying for advice, you should be receiving advice that clearly improves your decision-making, not just fund names.\nThe biggest mistake investors make\nA common error is switching from regular to direct funds purely to save cost, without changing behaviour. If you move to direct funds but start timing markets, jumping themes, or reacting to social media tips, you may end up worse off than before.\nAnother mistake is staying in regular funds indefinitely without questioning whether the advice is still relevant or valuable.\nA practical way to decide\nAsk yourself one honest question: if markets fall sharply and stay volatile for months, will I stay invested without reassurance? If the answer is yes, direct funds are likely suitable. If the answer is no, paying for good advice through regular funds may actually protect your long-term returns.\nThe best choice is not universal. Direct funds reward discipline. Regular funds reward those who need structure and guidance. What matters most is choosing the option that helps you stay invested, aligned to goals, and consistent over decades, not just the one that looks better on a return chart.",

In absolute terms, however, reserves held largely steady at about Rs 2.02 lakh crore, compared with Rs 2.03 lakh crore a month earlier.\nThe slight pullback in cash came even as Indian equities scaled fresh record highs, buoyed by hopes of a trade pact with the US and growing conviction that global and domestic central banks may begin reducing rates in the coming months.\nIn November, the benchmark indices extended their winning streak, with the Sensex rising 2.11 percent and the Nifty advancing 1.87 percent. The broader market, however, delivered a more mixed performance: the BSE MidCap index edged up 0.35 percent, while the BSE SmallCap index slipped 3.4 percent, reflecting selective investor appetite amid stretched valuations.\nAnalysts say the reluctance to deploy cash more aggressively reflects an underlying wariness about stretched valuations across market segments. While fund managers usually hold cash to cushion volatility, maintaining a defensive stance for too long can become a performance drag. Most fund houses are therefore choosing to align deployment with earnings visibility and valuation comfort rather than making bold cash calls.\nAmong large fund houses, SBI Mutual Fund, Parag Parikh, ICICI Prudential and Motilal Oswal trimmed their cash positions slightly in November.\nSBI MF reduced cash to 3.89 percent of its equity assets, down from 4.2 percent in October. Parag Parikh MF lowered its buffer to 21.37 percent, though it remained elevated relative to 22.17 percent a month ago.\nICICI Prudential pared cash to 5.01 percent from 5.33 percent, while Motilal Oswal and Nippon India MF cut their cushions to 6.52 percent and 1.65 percent, respectively, compared with 7.2 percent and 1.74 percent in October.\nSeveral others—including Wealth Co MF, Capitalmind MF, Trust MF, 360 One, Quantum MF and Bajaj Finserv MF—also reported meaningful declines in cash reserves.\nBy contrast, a handful of fund houses took the opposite route, adding to their liquidity. HDFC MF increased its cash buffer to 6.55 percent from 6.34 percent, Quant MF raised its holding to 13.9 percent from 11.77 percent, and Axis MF and Kotak MF nudged theirs up to 4.22 percent and 2.44 percent, respectively.\nSamco, LIC Mutual Fund, Helios, Unifi, Groww, Bank of India MF and WhiteOak Capital also reported notable increases in cash levels compared with the previous month.",

        "full_content": "A new deep-dive on India’s alternative investment landscape shows that mutual fund alpha erosion has become structural and wealthy investors are voting with their capital. IVCA-360 ONE CRISIL’s latest report states plainly that the “decline in alpha generation of equity mutual funds since 2017, and the notable decline in yields of a majority of debt mutual funds… have prompted investors to search for alternative asset classes such as AIFs and PMS.”\nThe shift underlines a fundamental reconfiguration of how domestic investors, particularly HNIs, ultra-HNIs and family offices conceptualise public-market exposure. And the alternatives drawing their attention are not offshore funds or late-stage private vehicles but Category III AIFs and PMS, both of which sit squarely inside the public-markets ecosystem, operate with higher flexibility than MFs, and are showing measurably superior two- and three-year outcomes.\nOne of the findings in the report is that equity-linked AIF strategies, specifically those operating with listed and listed-plus-unlisted mandates, have consistently beaten the BSE Sensex PME+ benchmarks across six consecutive evaluation cycles from March 2022 to September 2024.\nThe pooled IRRs tell the story unambiguously:\nWhile mutual funds have struggled to extract alpha from broader indices amid institutionalisation and market efficiency, equity AIFs (particularly those with Cat-III-style flexibility) have preserved meaningful outperformance.\nFor HNIs and family offices, this is not lost. These investors now anchor the majority of AIF inflows, indicating a clear preference for concentrated, rules-based, high-conviction equity exposure over traditional diversified MF structures. PMS platforms that are closer in spirit to active stock-picking benefit from the same shift.\nDomestic capital now accounts for the majority of AIF commitments\nThis reallocation is happening on top of another structural shift: alternatives in India are no longer foreign capital–driven. Domestic LP share has increased from 50.3% (March 2024) to 52.7% (March 2025), an inflection point that the report flags as critical. Behind this rise are the exact investor categories that dominate India’s public markets: HNIs, Ultra-HNIs, Family offices, and Wealth-management platforms. Together, they contributed ₹72,667 crore of incremental domestic commitments over the period.\nThis matters because the same investor cohort that drives PMS flows, IPO subscriptions, high-conviction equity trades, long-short fund allocations and F&O-linked yield strategies is now allocating more to AIFs than ever before. Domestic wealth is funding India’s alternatives engine, not global funds.\nThe capital stack is also institutionalising. Government entities like SIDBI, NIIF, EDF, TDB, BIRAC and NABARD together contribute ₹24,293 crore, which is a meaningful national-level endorsement of alternatives as part of India’s financial architecture.\nRegulatory reforms are pushing AIFs closer to the public-market mainstream\nWhile performance is the core driver, regulation has accelerated the shift by making AIF structures cleaner, more transparent and more MF/PMS-like. The report highlights five major reforms between 2023 and 2025:\nDematerialisation of AIF units (2023): bringing operational parity with listed securities.\nStandardised valuation norms: creating comparability across PMS, MFs and AIFs.\nDirect plan + trail-only commission model (2024): reducing cost leakages and improving governance across distribution channels.\nRemoval of the priority distribution model: crucial for long-short and structured Cat-III products with complex waterfalls.\nCIV-based co-investment structure (2025): allowing cleaner participation for family offices and portfolio investors.\nThese changes reduce friction, enhance transparency, align incentives and remove legacy structures that prevented wider participation from mainstream HNI public-market investors.\nIPO cycle and liquidity support the expansion of equity alternatives\nThe public market cycle itself is providing strong tailwinds. India has averaged one IPO per day for two consecutive fiscal years—234 in FY25 and 119 in FY26 till September. The report links this high-velocity primary market to stronger exit visibility for equity-linked AIF strategies. In practice, this means better valuation discovery, easier monetisation, and faster DPI.\nDPI and capital recycling reinforce the migration\nDistribution data in the report indicates that many Indian AIFs, especially those with market-linked or short-duration mandates, have achieved significant capital returns within typical fund lives.\nDebt AIFs return 50% of capital in 3.1 years while real estate AIFs in 4.2 years. 28.4% of debt AIFs and 34% of real estate AIFs have fully returned investor capital (100% DPI)\nEquity-linked AIFs also show progressively improving DPI as exits accelerate\nFor family offices, whose portfolio construction moves dynamically with liquidity, these cashflows often cycle back into PMS, Cat-III funds or public-market primary issuances. The loop reinforces itself.",

The face value of each unit is US$ 100, with the Net Asset Value (NAV) computed on a daily basis. The scheme has no lock-in period and does not levy any exit load. The fund offers two classes of units: Class A (Direct) with a minimum initial investment of US$ 5,000 and minimum top-ups of US$ 500, carrying a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.30%, and Class B (Regular) with similar investment requirements but a higher TER of 0.60%.\nAccording to PPFAS , the fund structure offers several advantages for investors. There are no inheritance tax implications, and tax compliance is simplified since taxes are paid at the fund level. Additionally, the OPI route is permitted only through a GIFT City–based pooled vehicle, ensuring regulatory alignment. Investors also benefit from optimized costs, particularly in terms of foreign exchange conversion and transaction expenses. Overall, the framework provides strong compliance and robust governance standards.\n90-100% of the allocation will be to ETFs and UCITS linked to the respective index and around 0 - 10% to debt instruments.\nLast month at the Moneycontrol Mutual Fund Summit in Bangalore, PPFAS' Neil Parikh had said that they were set to launch three new international equity FoFs, aimed at helping investors diversify their portfolios towards global offerings. The third offering is an active fund.",

The came together to decode how active fund managers can find alpha in a tough market.\nThe discussion began with a shared perspective that the present situation requires both confidence and caution. Sharing insights on the importance of strong risk management, Deepak Shenoy encouraged investors to prioritize large-cap companies with consistent earnings and reliable business models. Taking a more positive stance, Anish Tawakley, pointed out the early signs of improvement in sectors like consumer durables and defence. He urged investors to look past short-term market fluctuations to spot long-term prospects. Building on this, Harsha Upadhyaya stressed the need for disciplined valuation and the importance of maintaining a clear mind during volatile market conditions.\nFurther, the conversation shifted to sector allocation, where Deepak Shenoy favoured cyclical sectors such as industrial capital goods, cement, automobiles, and financials, which typically respond well to economic recovery. Anish Tawakley emphasized growth areas like technology, electric vehicles, and high-end manufacturing. Harsha Upadhyaya, On the other hand, believed that large-cap stocks offer the most balanced returns in times of uncertainty.\nHowever, all three speakers agreed that to find alpha today, you need to have a thorough understanding of the basics, be able to clearly see market trends, and be patient. Together, they supported India's changing environment, which created great chances for anyone with a long-term investment strategy to do better than the rest of the market, notably in areas like home production, cars, healthcare, and electronics.\nThe session concluded with a shared belief: real alpha is built on strong, data-supported conviction, a disciplined strategy, and the patience to stick with a plan.

        "full_content": "Banking operations at public sector banks across the country are likely to be disrupted on Tuesday as the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) goes ahead with its nationwide strike on January 27, pressing for the immediate implementation of a five-day work week.\nThe strike call comes after a conciliation meeting held on January 23 with the Chief Labour Commissioner failed to break the deadlock. UFBU is an umbrella body of nine unions representing officers and employees of public sector banks.\nWith banks already closed on Sunday (January 25) and Monday (January 26) on account of Republic Day, customers could face disruption in branch-level services for three consecutive days.\n“Despite detailed discussions during the conciliation proceedings, there was no assurance on our demand. Hence, we have been compelled to proceed with the strike action,” All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) General Secretary C H Venkatachalam told PTI.\nAll India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC) General Secretary Rupam Roy said the move to declare all Saturdays as holidays was agreed upon between the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) and UFBU during the wage revision settlement in March 2024.\n“It is unfortunate that the government is not responding to our genuine demand. There would be no loss of man-hours as we have agreed to work an extra 40 minutes daily from Monday to Friday,” Roy said.\nNational Confederation of Bank Employees (NCBE) General Secretary L Chandrasekhar said the agitation was not directed against customers. “This movement is not against customers, but for a sustainable, humane, and efficient banking system. A rested banker serves the nation better. A balanced workforce strengthens financial stability. 5-Day banking is not a luxury; it is an economic and human necessity,” he said.\nBranch-level services such as cash deposits and withdrawals, cheque clearances and administrative work are expected to be affected at public sector banks, including State Bank of India (SBI), Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Bank of Baroda.\nPrivate sector lenders such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are expected to remain largely unaffected, as their employees are not part of the unions participating in the strike.\nDigital banking services, including UPI and internet banking, are expected to function normally, though ATM cash availability could face localised disruptions due to logistical issues.\nSeveral public sector banks, including SBI, have informed stock exchanges about the possible impact. “While the bank has made necessary arrangements to ensure normal functioning in its branches and offices on the day of strike, it is likely that work in the bank may be impacted by the strike,” SBI said in a regulatory filing.\nThe unions are demanding the declaration of all Saturdays as holidays, a proposal that was part of the 12th Bipartite Settlement signed with the IBA in March 2024 but is yet to receive government notification. Currently, banks operate on the first, third and fifth Saturdays of every month.",

This is not a qualification of the bank’s financials. This is a qualification in the subsidiary’s financials, which pertains to certain incidents in past years,” the management said.\nHe added that the financial impact of these issues had already been fully provided for in earlier years, and the ongoing exercise relates primarily to staff accountability and closure of investigative processes, rather than identification of fresh losses.\n“What is now going on is simply the investigation in terms of staff accountability and figuring out if there is anything open that is left. There is no financial impact coming out of this,” management said.\nResponding to questions on the nature of the investigation, the bank confirmed that the qualified conclusion relates to BFIL’s role as a business correspondent in the microfinance segment, and is linked to certain practices in past years, including around collections.\nManagement described the auditor’s qualification as procedural rather than adverse, noting that the auditors have stated they are unable to conclude whether any additional aspects require examination until the investigation is completed.\n“It is simply a qualified report stating that until completion of the investigation, they are not able to establish if there is any other aspect that needs to be looked at. But the financial implications are all taken,” the executive said.\nWhen asked whether the matter related to earlier frauds or defaults at the ground level, management responded in the affirmative, reiterating that these had already been identified and accounted for in previous periods.\nThe bank also emphasised that there is no financial implication on IndusInd Bank’s books, either standalone or consolidated, arising from the continuing qualification at BFIL.",

        "full_content": "IndusInd Bank has initiated disciplinary proceedings against officials found responsible for past accounting discrepancies, and has already concluded action in the majority of cases, the lender said in its latest disclosures alongside its Q3 FY26 financial results.\nIn a note to accounts, the bank said it had assessed the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in earlier irregularities and fixed accountability in line with its internal code of conduct.\nWhile disciplinary proceedings have been completed for most employees, the bank said remaining cases are still under process and will be taken to their “logical conclusion” in compliance with internal rules and applicable laws.\nThe disclosure assumes significance as it follows a series of accounting lapses identified by the bank during FY25, which had raised questions around internal controls, governance oversight and accountability within the private sector lender.\nDuring the financial year ended March 31, 2025, IndusInd Bank had identified multiple discrepancies across its books. These included irregularities in the accounting of derivative trades amounting to Rs 1,959.98 crore, incorrect recognition of interest and fee income of Rs 846.40 crore linked to its microfinance (MFI) portfolio, and manual accounting entries totalling Rs 595 crore posted under \"Other Assets\" and \"Other Liabilities\".\nThe bank had accounted for the financial impact of these discrepancies in FY25 itself, and informed investors that corrective steps were being taken to strengthen systems and processes.\nAs part of its response, the board had set up an executive-level project management group to oversee remediation measures. These included tightening internal financial controls, reducing dependence on manual entries, improving reconciliation processes and strengthening system-driven checks.\nIn their limited review report for the December 2025 quarter, the bank’s joint statutory auditors explicitly drew attention to the note on disciplinary action, stating that the bank has “initiated and completed the process of disciplinary action against majority of the persons involved in the discrepancies and irregularities”.\nWhile the auditors did not modify their conclusion on the financial results, the reference underscores the materiality of governance and accountability issues arising from the lapses.\nThe disciplinary action disclosure also mirrors a similar note in the standalone financial results, indicating that the process applies across both consolidated and standalone entities.\nThe bank has not disclosed the number of officials against whom action has been taken, the nature of penalties imposed, or whether senior management personnel were involved. However, the emphasis on fixing accountability and concluding pending cases suggests heightened regulatory and board-level scrutiny.\nIndusInd Bank said it remains fully committed to concluding the remaining disciplinary cases strictly in line with its code of conduct and prevailing laws. The lender added that progress on remediation measures continues to be monitored on an ongoing basis.",

        "full_content": "Punjab National Bank (PNB) has already transmitted a significant part of the recent rate-cut cycle to depositors, with deposit rates reduced from 7.25 percent to 6.60 percent by December and further lowered to 6.40 percent from January, Ashok Chandra, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, told Moneycontrol in an interview on January 22.\nOverall, around 55-60 basis points of deposit rate repricing has already been completed, Chandra said, adding that the transmission process is still underway.\n“The remaining 20–30 basis points of reduction should happen in the fourth quarter,” he said, indicating that banks will continue to recalibrate deposit rates in line with the changing interest rate environment.\nChandra noted that the staggered approach to repricing reflects a balance between protecting margins and gradually passing on the benefits of lower policy rates to depositors.\nEdited excerpts:\nIs the Q3FY26 profit the highest-ever reported by the bank. What has driven this performance?\nThere are multiple factors behind this record performance. First, we have significantly increased our focus on the retail, agriculture, and MSME (RAM) segments.\nMSME advances are growing at 19 percent, retail at 18.5 percent, and agriculture at over 10 percent. These segments contribute meaningfully more to profitability, and this strategic shift is now delivering strong returns.\nSecond, we have launched and strengthened several new verticals. They include supply chain finance, cash management services, and credit card business. While one of these verticals existed earlier, it has been significantly strengthened. Together, these three new departments are adding to the bank’s bottom line.\nThird, savings bank (SB) account mobilisation has played a key role. In April last year, we revamped our CASA products. Under the new scheme, we opened around 30.6 lakh new accounts, mobilising over Rs 20,000 crore in SB deposits. This has directly supported profitability.\nAnother important aspect is operating performance. For the first time, our operating profit crossed Rs 7,000 crore in the June quarter and remained above that level in the September quarter as well, showing consistency.\nFinally, recoveries have been strong. During the quarter, total recovery stood at Rs 4,090 crore, of which Rs 1,956 crore was technical recovery. All these factors together have driven the highest-ever profit for the bank.\nWhere do you see the bank’s profitability closing for the full year?\nWe are confident that our operating profit will remain above Rs 7,000 crore every quarter. Net profit is also expected to be more than Rs 5,000 crore every quarter on a consistent basis.\nCorporate loan growth was around 9 percent year on year. How does the corporate pipeline look for Q4 and FY26?\nIn the first nine months of this financial year, we have sanctioned corporate loans worth Rs 3.12 lakh crore, out of which disbursements of about Rs 1 lakh crore are still pending.\nFor context, in FY24-25, total corporate loan sanctions were around Rs 2 lakh crore. This year, sanctions have already crossed Rs 3.15 lakh crore, and by March-end, we expect this to exceed Rs 4 lakh crore, almost double that of last year.\nWe could have grown the corporate loan book by 11-12 percent, but we are consciously reducing low-yielding assets and IBPC (Inter-Bank Participation Certificates) exposures. This strategy supports long-term profitability and consistency. As a result, we expect corporate loan growth to be around 8-9 percent by the end of this financial year.\nYou have guided for a 60:40 RAM-to-corporate loan mix. Currently it stands at 57:43. When will this target be achieved?\nWe are aiming the 60:40 ratio in FY26-27. Most likely, this will materialise by Q3 or Q4 of that year, as building a high-quality RAM book takes time.\nHow will this shift in loan mix impact margins, especially after recent rate cuts?\nThe real positive impact on margins will be visible from Q2 of FY26-27, assuming no further rate cuts. Around 125 basis points of policy rate cuts have already taken place, but we have not fully transmitted these to deposit rates, particularly in Q3.\nSome deposit rate reductions, around 20-30 basis points, were implemented from January 1. Additionally, older deposits raised at higher rates, including a 7.25 percent special scheme last year, are now getting repriced. The combined impact should become clearly visible from Q2 of FY26-27.\nHow much of the rate cut has been transmitted to deposit rates so far?\nFrom 7.25 percent, deposit rates were reduced to 6.60 percent until December, and further to 6.40 percent from January. Overall, around 55-60 basis points of repricing has already been completed. The remaining 20-30 basis points should happen in Q4.\nWhat are your expectations from the February RBI policy?\nGiven the strong growth outlook and moderating inflation, we do not expect any further rate cuts in Q4.\nCASA has remained resilient despite industry-wide pressure, but it has declined slightly year on year. What are your expectations, going forward?\nWhen credit growth is running at 11-12 percent, CASA cannot grow at the same pace. A lag is inevitable. We believe 8-9 percent CASA growth is reasonable and achievable.\nCurrently, CASA growth stands at 5.66 percent year on year. While individual SB balances are growing well, institutional SB balances, particularly government accounts, are declining due to changes in government fund management under CNA (Central Nodal Agency) and SNA (Single Nodal Agency) frameworks. This trend is impacting the entire banking system, not just PNB.\nHow much has institutional SB balance declined over the past year?\nSB institutional balances have declined by around Rs 7,000 crore between December 2024 and December 2025. This decline offsets growth in individual SB and current accounts, impacting overall CASA growth.\nOn ECL provisioning, how much has been provided so far?\nThis quarter, we made total provisions of Rs 1,343 crore. Out of this, Rs 955 crore is towards ECL-related floating provisions.\nAs of now, we have built a cumulative floating provision of Rs 1,775 crore for ECL implementation. Depending on profitability, we may add further provisions in Q4. This gives us a strong cushion ahead of ECL implementation, potentially reaching around Rs 2,500 crore.\nIf we had not made the Rs 955 crore ECL provision this quarter, net profit would have exceeded Rs 6,000 crore. However, from a long-term balance sheet strength perspective, this approach is prudent.\nAre there plans to sell large NPAs through NCLT or ARCs in Q4?\nYes. We expect around Rs 500 crore recovery through NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal)  , Rs 250 crore through NARCL(National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited) , and about Rs 160 crore via ARCs. Overall, Q4 recoveries should be in the range of Rs 4,000-4,500 crore, similar to Q3.\nOur full-year recovery target stands at Rs 16,000 crore.",

It ended the previous session at 91.70 after hitting a record low of 91.74.\nTrump, who headlined the World Economic Forum on January 21, said he has put together a “framework of a future deal” on Greenland, following a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on the sidelines of the WEF in Davos.\nTrump also said new tariffs on European countries that opposed his Greenland ambitions were no longer needed, signaling a softer approach after weeks of tension.\nOn January 21, the rupee sank to a new low of 91.74 against the dollar in the afternoon trade following risk-off sentiment over Greenland and consistent selling by the foreign investors, currency experts said.\nA DBS Bank India report said on the markets end, the maturity of short-term swaps in the NDF market contributed to the swift pace of depreciation this week. “Authorities have intervened to slow the pace of the rupee correction, although the measured rise in vols pointed to absence of speculative intent or panic,” it said.\nAmit Pabari, managing director at CR Forex Advisors, said the rupee’s weakness was largely driven by global risk aversion rather than domestic factors. Renewed geopolitical tensions pushed markets toward safe havens like the US dollar and gold, while equities fell, creating an unfavourable backdrop for emerging-market currencies and keeping the rupee under pressure.",

After this, the local currency started depreciating sharply amid outflows by the foreign portfolio investors (FPI) from Indian equities, and hit a mark of 91 against the US dollar in subsequent months.\nThe central bank has been defending the local currency since it touched and crossed the 91-mark by intervening in the spot market.\nThe central bank’s action came at a time when the rupee had been hitting consecutive record lows and, earlier this week. Such relentless depreciation triggered concerns over imported inflation and broader market sentiment, prompting the RBI to lean heavily on its foreign exchange reserves to stabilise the currency.\nThe currency has been under pressure in the last few months, especially due to the delay in the trade deal, which led to the currency hitting fresh record lows. On the other hand, the limited intervention by the RBI was also adding to the pain.\nIn the last three months, the rupee has been trading in the range of 88.20-91.74 against the US dollar.",

It opened at 91.08 against the greenback as against previous close of 90.9 against the greenback. It closed down 0.8% at record low of  91.69.\n“Rupee again faltered to a new low of 91.74 as Trump's Greenland issue, Japan bonds selloff and risk-off sentiment takes it lower with equities also down, keeping markets on a sixth straight day of decline,” said Anil Kumar Bhansali, Head of Treasury and Executive Director Finrex Treasury Advisors LLP. This is the biggest single-day fall for rupee in last three months.\nWith the current fall, the domestic currency turned out to be the second worst performing currency among Asian peers with a fall of 1.98 percent so far in 2026.\nBhansali added that FPIs have offloaded Rs 33,000 crore in Indian equities so far in January, with net sales on 12 days pressurizing domestic markets. “Delays in India-US Trade deal, higher US tariffs on Indian exports and elevated dollar demand from importers particularly those dealing in precious metals has exacerbated the slide.”\nFurther, the benchmark equity indices Sensex and Nifty extended their losses on Wednesday, slipping further after a sharp sell-off in the previous session, amid weak global cues and rising geopolitical concerns.\nIn early trade, the Sensex declined 1,056.02 points, or 1.28 percent to an intraday low of 81,124.45, while the broader Nifty fell 312.7 points, or 1.23 percent to 24,919.80, slipping below the 25,000-mark for the first time in over four months.
