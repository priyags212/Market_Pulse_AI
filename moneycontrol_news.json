        "full_content": "Asian investors are pouring record amounts into gold exchange-traded funds, leading some to question whether the rally in bullion is getting close to topping out.\n\nPrecious metals ETFs listed in the region have attracted $7.1 billion in net inflows in January, with a number drawing in all-time amounts of capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest gains were seen by funds listed in China that cater to retail investors, with Huaan Yifu Gold ETF alone luring in $1.9 billion.\n\nThe price of bullion has skyrocketed is recent weeks, with the yellow metal advancing more than 20% since the start of January, despite a pullback on Friday. High levels of buying by retail investors is often seen as a sign a rally is in its later stages and an asset is overvalued.\n\n“We have been major gold bulls in this cycle,” buying both gold-mining stocks and ETFs, said Nick Ferres, chief investment officer at Vantage Point Asset Management in Singapore. “However, the recent price action has become rapid, emotional and non-linear, which is a warning sign that the trend is extended tactically.”\n\nGold’s breakneck rally has been underpinned by elevated central-bank purchases and inflows into bullion-backed ETFs. Total holdings in gold-backed funds rose every month last year except May, according to World Gold Council data. Precious metals have also benefited from a switch away from the dollar due to unpredictable US policymaking and increasing American isolation.\n\nAmid other warnings signs, gold’s relative strength index has climbed to about 90, above the level of 70 that is taken to indicate a pullback is overdue. A successful outcome from policies set by the Trump administration would accelerate economic growth, leading to higher interest rates and a stronger US dollar, pushing gold lower, the World Gold Council said in its 2026 outlook published last month.\n\nAmong other China-listed funds that have seen sizable inflows in January, the ChinaAMC Gold ETF drew in $420 million, while the GF Shanghai Gold ETF attracted $191.4 million, both set for records, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nSome silver-focused Asian ETFs are also heading for monthly inflow records. South Korea-listed Samsung KODEX Silver Futures Special Asset ETF has gained $231.6 million in net inflows for January, also set for a record.\n\nIn another sign of frenzied demand, China’s only pure-play silver fund — the UBS SDIC Silver Futures Fund LOF — paused subscriptions on Wednesday and halted trading Friday, after massive inflows drove the fund to an elevated premium over its underlying assets.\n\nAsset management companies are set to respond to the rising demand for gold ETFs by bringing new products to the market, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n“ETF issuers are likely to tap demand for safe-haven assets with more gold-related funds,” analysts Rebecca Sin and Michelle Leung wrote in a research note. “Hong Kong, which offers tools ranging from low-cost physical tracking to leveraged futures and mining equities, has two new listings this week as it seeks to strengthen its position as a gold trading hub.”",

These forums focus on strengthening cooperation and addressing barriers affecting cross-border space trade and joint missions.\n\nA questionnaire has been circulated to the industry which seeks detailed responses on regulatory and licensing obstacles encountered by Indian firms selling space hardware, software and services to US customers.\n\nThese include issues related to export licences, payload approvals, data restrictions and certification requirements.\n\nA key area of focus is the impact of US export control regimes such as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and rules governing the use of US-origin components.\n\nIN-SPACe has asked companies to highlight what specific relaxations or clarifications could improve the process of making deals with American partners.\n\nAccording to sources, IN-SPACe has also asked which US approval processes, including launch permissions, satellite licensing, and so on could be reformed to encourage stronger India–US partnerships.\n\nStartups have also been asked to suggest mechanisms that could help Indian firms be recognised as \"trusted suppliers\" for sensitive US space supply chains. These include certifications, secure facilities, compliance frameworks and audit systems.\n\nCompanies have also been asked whether India's current intellectual property, data-sharing and co-development rules are flexible to support research and development with US firms.\n\nThis outreach by IN-SPACe marks a shift by New Delhi to translate diplomatic goodwill into market access for Indian firms. By gathering empirical data on US regulatory bottlenecks, India is arming itself with the evidence needed to challenge legacy export controls and licensing barriers at upcoming trade talks."

The S&P 500 closed well above its session low but still ended the day down 9.02 points, or 0.13%, at 6,969.01.\n\nYields on the 10-year Treasury up 3 basis points at 4.26 percent, while the yields on 2-year US Treasuries were up marginally at 3.56 percent.\n\nPresident Trump’s comments that he plans to announce his nomination for the next Fed chair have helped to support the US dollar as it climbs ~0.4% against the yen, euro and other major peers.\n\nAsian currencies were trading lower in the early trade on Friday with Thai Baht leading the losers followed by Japanese Yen, Malaysian Ringgit, Singapore Dollar.\n\nOil was on track for the biggest monthly advance since 2022 as traders weighed President Donald Trump’s escalating threats against Iran, and how any potential hostilities could impact flows from the Middle East.\n\nGold and silver are sliding as the stronger-dollar impact of Trump’s announcement he will soon name a Fed Chair candidate broadens out.\n\nOn January 29, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold shares worth Rs 393 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) purchased equities of Rs 2638 crore in the market.\n\nHope you're all set for today's trade.

        "full_content": "The benchmark indices added 0.3 percent gains and maintained an uptrend for three consecutive sessions on January 29, but market breadth turned negative. About 1,717 shares declined against 1,205 advancing shares on the NSE. The market may see range-bound trading ahead of the Union Budget scheduled on February 1. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:\n\nJay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services\n\nNTPC consolidated in a long-term wedge since April 2025. After breaking above the wedge, it traded sideways in a rectangular range. The latest session delivered a strong breakout above this range on robust positive volume, confirming buyer conviction.\n\nThe price now trades above all key EMAs with upward slopes. The RSI holds support at 50 on both daily and weekly charts, supporting continued bullish momentum. The structure remains firmly bullish while support holds.\n\nIpca Laboratories| CMP: Rs 1,479.7\n\nIpca Laboratories broke out from a prolonged triangular consolidation (from January 2–9, 2026), gaining 13.6 percent while broader indices fell around 2.5 percent, showing clear relative strength. The breakout was backed by strong volume. The stock is now retesting the breakout zone and formed a dragonfly doji on January 21, signalling throwback exhaustion. Support has been defended for the third time.\n\nMomentum indicators remain bullish and rising. The price is trading above short-, medium-, and long-term EMAs. Repeated support defence and relative strength point to a high-probability reversal. Adding more above Rs 1,525 could propel the bullish move.\n\nNMDC broke out above a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on December 23 from Rs 78.6, rallying to Rs 86.72 before correcting. The pullback found support at the 100-day EMA and successfully retested the breakout zone.\n\nThe latest bounce formed a strong three white soldiers pattern with rising positive volume, confirming accumulation. The price trades above all key EMAs with upward slopes. Momentum indicators align bullishly, and the structure favours buyers as long as the 100-day EMA holds.\n\nOm Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities\n\nMishra Dhatu Nigam| CMP: Rs 387.5\n\nMishra Dhatu Nigam has shown a sharp pickup in momentum and is now attempting to break above a long-standing downward trendline on the daily chart. The stock has moved decisively higher and is trading above its short-term moving average, indicating improving strength. Volumes have remained stable alongside the rise in price.\n\nThe daily RSI is placed near 66, highlighting strengthening momentum. The DMI setup shows the positive directional line above the negative line, while the ADX remains elevated, confirming improving trend strength. As long as the stock sustains above the Rs 360 zone, the near-term outlook remains positive.\n\nBharat Petroleum Corporation| CMP: Rs 366.95\n\nBPCL has bounced back from a triple bottom pattern after a corrective phase. The stock is now holding above the previous resistance zone and is attempting to move higher from the Rs 360–365 area. It is trading above its short- and medium-term moving averages and has reclaimed the mid-Bollinger band.\n\nThe daily RSI is placed near the 55 level. The rate of change indicator remains in positive territory, supporting the ongoing recovery attempt. As long as BPCL holds above the Rs 355 support area, the near-term outlook remains steady. The stock is also respecting the rising VWAP (volume-weighted average price).\n\nBSE has maintained its post-September recovery and is currently trading within a well-defined range on the daily chart. After a sharp advance from the September lows, the stock has spent the last several weeks consolidating between the Rs 2,650 and Rs 2,950 zones, with prices now positioned in the upper half of this range.\n\nThe stock continues to trade above its 20-day average near Rs 2,750, indicating that short-term support remains intact. The daily RSI is placed near 60, reflecting steady momentum. The DMI setup shows the positive directional line above the negative line, while the ADX remains low. As long as the stock holds above Rs 2,750, the broader setup remains stable, with a directional move likely only on a decisive range breakout.\n\nHitesh Tailor, Technical Research Analyst at Choice Broking\n\nLarsen & Toubro| CMP: Rs 3,932.9\n\nLarsen & Toubro continues to exhibit a strong bullish structure in the longer-term trend. On the weekly chart, the stock is maintaining a clear higher high–higher low formation, confirming sustained trend strength. Recently, L&T delivered a breakout above its previous higher high. Post-breakout, the price retraced toward the 50-week EMA, where it found strong support and resumed its upward move, indicating healthy pullback buying and trend validation.\n\nThe stock is trading comfortably above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-week EMAs, reinforcing the presence of a robust primary uptrend and positive medium-to-long-term sentiment. On the downside, Rs 3,800 acts as an important support zone, where accumulation activity is visible. The latest weekly candle has engulfed the previous range, reflecting renewed bullish dominance and improving momentum.\n\nIndus Towers has recently delivered a decisive breakout from its prolonged sideways range, signalling the beginning of a fresh bullish phase. Post-breakout, the stock witnessed a healthy retest of the breakout zone, where it successfully took support aligned with the 50-day EMA and has since started moving higher, indicating strong follow-through buying and improving price structure.\n\nThe stock is trading above its key 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMAs, confirming a well-established uptrend and reinforcing positive short-to-medium-term sentiment. From the recent bottom, Indus Towers is forming a higher high and higher low structure, reflecting sustained demand and trend continuation. On the downside, Rs 425 remains an important support area, where accumulation activity is clearly visible.\n\nMomentum also supports the bullish view, with the RSI placed at 61.89, holding above the midline and turning higher, suggesting strengthening upside momentum.\n\nAxis Bank is showing clear signs of strength after registering a decisive breakout above its previous higher high. The breakout is supported by strong volumes, indicating genuine buying interest and improved participation, which enhances the reliability of the move and signals bullish intent.\n\nOn the weekly chart, the stock is trading comfortably above its key 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-week EMAs, confirming a well-established primary uptrend and strengthening medium-to-long-term sentiment. On the downside, the Rs 1,320–1,340 zone emerges as an important support area, aligned with the earlier higher-high breakout region, indicating a classic role reversal from resistance to support and providing a favourable risk-reward setup.\n\nMomentum indicators further support the bullish outlook, with the RSI placed at 69.36, reflecting a strong rising trend and sustained upside momentum without immediate signs of exhaustion."

        "full_content": "India’s new consumer price index (CPI) series, set to be released on February 12, will mark a significant shift in how inflation is measured, with food losing prominence and rural India gaining a larger say in the overall index.\n\nAccording to the report of the expert group on revising the CPI base year, the weight of food and beverages in the headline index will decline sharply to 36.8 percent from 45.9 percent in the current 2012-based series. The change reflects evolving consumption patterns, with households spending a greater share on non-food items and services as incomes rise and urbanisation deepens.\n\nWhile food’s influence on headline inflation will reduce, the new series places a higher weight on rural India. The rural share in CPI is expected to rise to 55.4 percent, compared with 53.52 percent earlier. In contrast, the weight of urban India will fall to 44.6 percent from 46.48 percent. This rebalancing is based on updated consumption expenditure data and signals the continued importance of rural demand in shaping national inflation trends.\n\nA closer look at the expenditure groups shows that several non-food categories have gained weight in the new 2024 series. Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels now account for 17.7 percent of the index, up from 16.9 percent earlier. Health services have also seen a marginal increase to 6.1 percent from 5.9 percent, while transport and communication have edged up to 12.4 percent from 8.6 percent earlier.\n\nRestaurants and accommodation services account for 3.3 percent. Personal care, social protection and miscellaneous goods and services have been assigned a 5 percent share, reflecting the growing role of services in household spending.\n\nSome traditional categories, however, have lost ground. Clothing and footwear now account for 6.4 percent of the basket, slightly lower than 6.5 percent earlier, while education services have seen a sharper drop to 3.3 percent from 4.5 percent. Recreation, sport and culture also now carry a weight of 1.5 percent.\n\nOverall, the “miscellaneous” group—which largely captures non-food items and services—has expanded significantly, rising to 36.2 percent from 28.3 percent earlier. This structural shift is expected to make headline inflation less volatile over time, as the index becomes less sensitive to sharp swings in food prices, particularly vegetables.\n\nFor policymakers, the changes imply that future CPI readings may better reflect underlying demand conditions, even as rural price trends continue to play a dominant role in shaping India’s inflation trajectory.\n\nThe Economic Survey released on January 29 noted that inflation is likely to stay benign in the coming year, but core inflation still needed to be monitored."

        "full_content": "Oracle Corp. shares have fallen more than 50% from last year’s all-time high as investors concerned about the artificial intelligence trade and the company’s links to OpenAI flee the stock.\n\nThe stock’s decline has erased about $463 billion in market value from a record hit on Sept. 10 after the company reported an impressive outlook for its cloud business that pointed to soaring demand for AI. The rally brought Oracle’s valuation to more than $933 billion, making it the 10th most valuable publicly-listed US company at the time.\n\nThe swift decline in Oracle shares has been amplified by growing investor concern over AI as the biggest technology companies continue to pledge billions of dollars in capital expenditures to build out data centers, in some cases without a clear return on investment. Added to the mix are circular deals between OpenAI, a private company that’s not profitable, and companies such as Oracle and Nvidia. Oracle has also raised tens of billions of dollars of bonds recently through note sales in its name and indirectly through projects it’s backing.\n\n“There’s some assumptions built in here about what OpenAI is going to spend and where are they getting that money and, you know, is this really going to happen,” said Eric Diton, president and managing director of Wealth Alliance, an investment advisory firm. “Maybe Oracle stock got way ahead of fundamentals and now the market’s saying, alright, show me, I wanna see it.”\n\nOracle’s December earnings report kicked off the most recent leg lower, as the company said it ramped up spending on AI data centers, feeding concerns about how long it will take for the expenditures to pay off. A measure of Oracle’s credit risk jumped to its highest level since 2009 following the report.\n\nShares have also been weighed down by news that Blue Owl Capital, which has helped finance data center projects for Oracle and Meta Platforms Inc, is not included in final negotiations on an equity deal for a data center project in Michigan. Oracle said the negotiations are “on schedule.”\n\nIt’s also been caught up in a broader selloff in software stocks, which have seen valuations compressed as investor concern about disruption from AI mount. Anthropic’s mid-January release of a new AI tool weighed on software stocks."

        "full_content": "Copper surged by the most in more than 16 years, after a wave of buying from Chinese investors triggered one of the most dramatic moves in the market’s history.\n\nPrices gained as much as 11% to trade above $14,500 a ton for the first time ever, before a sharp retracement on Thursday afternoon as the dollar jumped.\n\nThe industrial metal, which is used in almost every electrical application, has risen about 21% since the start of December, firing up copper bulls who have long been predicting a surge in prices.\n\n“You wait a lifetime for markets like this,” said Mark Thompson, a mining executive and former trader at Trafigura Group with three decades of experience in the copper market. “We are one supply disruption away from $20,000.”\n\nChinese investors are piling into metals as they ride a powerful wave of momentum that has lifted everything from tin to silver to record highs. The initial surge in copper took place at a time of day when Chinese traders dominate flows, with prices on the London Metal Exchange rising more than 5% in less than an hour starting at 2.30 a.m. London time.\n\n“This is all driven by speculative funds,” said Yan Weijun, head of nonferrous metals research at Chinese trader Xiamen C&D Inc. “It’s likely all Chinese money given the surge is in Asian hours.”\n\nPrices rose more than $1,400 a ton before sliding by as much as $1,000 in less than an hour as US markets opened with a broad risk-off mood.\n\nCopper has long been a favorite of investors who see the energy transition and the growth of data centers driving demand. Still, the recent surge in prices has come in spite of indications of weak demand in China itself, which accounts for about half of physical consumption of the metal, and a widening contango on the LME, an indication of ample supplies.\n\nThe speculative frenzy has driven a surge in volumes on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, China’s top commodities trading platform. January was already the busiest month on record for the SHFE’s six base metals as of last week, and copper racked up its second-biggest daily trading volumes ever on Thursday.\n\nIt’s been an eye-watering few weeks for commodities, which have been aided by a sinking US dollar, rising demand for real, physical assets, and elevated geopolitical tensions as the Trump administration follows a more assertive foreign policy. Most recently, speculation that the next Federal Reserve chief will be more dovish than Jerome Powell has aided the rally.\n\n“Commodities are taking turns to rally,” said Eric Liu, deputy general manager of ASK Resources Co. “Copper has been hovering around $13,000 and funds have been brewing over the metal for some time.”\n\nCopper was up 3.1% at $13,495.00 a ton on the LME. Its intraday move was the biggest since 2009 — when China was rolling out massive stimulus measures in the aftermath of the great financial crisis. SHFE futures reached 114,000 yuan ($16,400) a ton as the exchange reopened for evening trading, following a 5.8% increase to 109,110 yuan at the close on Thursday. Other metals also rallied sharply in the morning before retreating in the afternoon, with aluminum down 1.5% and zinc up 2% in London.\n\nFed Chair Powell talked up a “clear improvement” in the US economic outlook as the bank kept borrowing costs on hold on Wednesday. His tenure ends in June, after which President Donald Trump may be better positioned to step up his campaign for lower rates.\n\n“Under the cycle in which the US maintains interest-rate cuts, the expectation for upward movement in copper prices has not changed,” said Chi Kai, chief investment officer at Shanghai Cosine Capital Management Partnership. “As for how high prices can rise, there is no clear expectation as long as the US continues to push AI, chips and power construction.”\n\nInvestors have been flocking in particular to metals needed in major growth markets. Tesla Inc.’s plan to spend $20 billion this year shifting resources to robotics and AI has underscored investment prospects. Copper, aluminum and tin would all be beneficiaries.\n\nBut the rally has been broad-based, with iron ore futures in Singapore gaining as much as 2.5%.\n\nThe advance in metals came after a gauge of the US currency sank to its lowest level in more than four years, with Trump signaling he was unconcerned by the weakness. That slide makes commodities more attractive for many buyers.\n\nThere are plenty of voices warning that the spectacular gains in metals have run ahead of real-world demand. There’s likely a “technical adjustment” coming as physical buyers in China balk at higher prices, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. co-head of China equities Trina Chen told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday."

        "full_content": "Technology shares declined, dragging the broader stock market lower, as earnings results from Microsoft Corp. boosted concern about the payoff from heavy spending on the artificial intelligence technology.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index fell 1.97% at 10: 45 a.m. in New York as Microsoft plummeted 11.84%, the most since 2020. The S&P 500 Index fell 1.26%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.571%. An equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 Index traded down 0.318%.\n\n“Investors are selling because they probably realized they are not going to make as much money on the AI theme as they hoped for half a year ago,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. “The AI theme is overcrowded, and investors are revaluing the AI trade, so they are re-weighting big-tech stocks in their portfolios.”\n\nShares of Microsoft declined after the company reported record spending and slowing cloud sales growth on Thursday, fueling concerns that it could take longer than expected for the firm’s AI investments to pay off. Capital expenditures for the fiscal second quarter hit $37.5 billion, up 66% from a year earlier and exceeding analyst estimates for $36.2 billion.\n\nIts performance stands in sharp contrast to Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. The stock traded 7.74% higher on Thursday, with analysts saying its stronger-than-expected revenue outlook supports its massive capital spending for the next year.\n\n“The AI theme, and who benefits from the AI capex going forward, remains the largest driver of factor and market cap calls,” said Dennis DeBusschere, president and chief market strategist at 22V Research.\n\nInvestors will get another chance to assess the megacap technology space after markets close Thursday, when Apple Inc. is due to report results.\n\nIn Washington, US President Donald Trump and Democrat Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are reportedly nearing a deal to avert a government shutdown. Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank, said that with funding expiring this weekend, “the US is creeping too close for comfort” to a stoppage.\n\nOfficial data showed the US trade deficit widened in November from the lowest level since 2009 as imports rebounded and exports fell. The goods and services trade gap nearly doubled from the prior month to $56.8 billion, Commerce Department data showed Thursday. The 94.6% widening was the largest since 1992, while the shortfall for the month exceeded all projections in a Bloomberg survey of economists.\n\nSeparately, initial jobless claims for the last week came in ahead of expectations, while continuing claims fell. Dow Inc. shares fell after the company said Thursday it would cut roughly 4,500 jobs."

        "full_content": "Brent crude futures topped $71 a barrel for the first time since August after US President Donald Trump warned Iran to make a nuclear deal or face military strikes.\n\nThe global oil benchmark rose as much as 5.1%, while US counterpart West Texas Intermediate topped $66 amid the renewed risk of conflict that could disrupt crude exports out of Iran or ripple effects across global markets if a critical shipping route is blocked.\n\nIn a social media post on Wednesday, Trump said that US ships he ordered to the region were ready to fulfill their mission “with speed and violence, if necessary.” The commodity rallied even higher after the Associated Press reported that Iran issued a warning to ships at sea that it planned to run a drill next week that would include live firing in the Strait of Hormuz, citing two Pakistani security officials and the EOS Risk Group.\n\nThe report stoked fears of a potential closure of the narrow passage that separates Iran and the Arabian peninsula, through which about a fifth of the world’s oil passes. Iran itself accounts for about 3% of global supply, producing roughly 3.3 million barrels per day.\n\nCrude has rallied so far in 2026, countering expectations for a market pressured by significant oversupply. Instead, geopolitical tensions from Iran to Venezuela and major supply disruption in Kazakhstan have helped to bolster prices.\n\nTrump’s latest threats have injected a risk premium into prices. Bullish call options have been more expensive than bearish puts for the longest stretch in about 14 months as traders seek to protect against the risk of a new confrontation between the US and Iran. Bullish option additions have also grown at the fastest pace in at least six years.\n\n“The potential for Iran getting hit has escalated the geopolitical premium of oil prices by potentially $3 to $4 a barrel,” Citigroup analysts including Anthony Yuen said in a note. “Oil prices can stay more elevated than many had expected, despite markets starting the year anticipating large oversupply.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly issued warnings on Iran, but those have most recently been linked to Tehran’s deadly crackdown on protests rather than its nuclear activities. The US president previously said the regime’s atomic program was “obliterated” in strikes in June that targeted three facilities.\n\nIn response, Iran has said it stands ready for dialogue but warned it would respond with unprecedented force if pushed. Tehran has stepped up diplomacy with key powers in the Middle East as it looks to head off more conflict with US."

        "full_content": "Microsoft Corp. plunged the most in almost six years after reporting record spending and slowing cloud sales growth, fueling investor concerns that it could take longer than expected for the company’s AI investments to pay off.\n\nThe shares sank by as much as 11% to $429.24, for the biggest intraday slide since March 2020.\n\nCapital expenditures for the fiscal second quarter hit $37.5 billion, up 66% from a year earlier and exceeding analyst estimates for $36.2 billion.\n\nThe Azure cloud-computing unit posted a 38% revenue gain during the quarter when adjusting for currency fluctuations, just meeting analysts’ projections. That growth rate slowed — by a percentage point — from the prior quarter. The company expects Azure sales to rise 37% to 38% in the current quarter.\n\n“One of the core issues that is weighing on investors is cap ex is growing faster than we expected, and maybe Azure is growing a little bit slower than we expected,” Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said during an analysts’ call. Investors, he said, were concerned about the return on that spending.\n\nChief Financial Officer Amy Hood responded by saying that a chunk of cloud capacity is going toward internal teams, which boosts products such as Copilot. Had all of the new capacity gone toward Azure, the growth rates would have been notably higher, she said.\n\nThe world’s largest software maker has experienced rapid growth in its cloud computing business, thanks in part to a landmark partnership with leading artificial intelligence startup OpenAI. But despite spending heavily on data centers, Microsoft has struggled to get capacity online quickly enough to meet demand.\n\nMicrosoft has been rushing to bake AI tools, including those powered by OpenAI, into its products, betting that chatbots and automation technology will boost sales of the company’s productivity software and cloud services.\n\nDuring the analyst call, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said companies are now paying for 15 million subscriptions to the M365 Copilot, Microsoft’s main AI tool for office workers. Adoption is growing among the company’s enormous base of corporate users, Nadella said.\n\nTotal sales increased 17% to $81.3 billion during the quarter, while profit was $5.16 a share, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. The net income figure was boosted by gains from Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI, which lifted per-share earnings by $1.02.\n\nAnalysts had expected sales of $80.3 billion and per-share earnings of $3.92.\n\nThe value of commitments from customers that Microsoft expects to materialize as sales in future years more than doubled from a year earlier, primarily the result of a new, $250 billion deal with OpenAI. The startup accounted for 45% of Microsoft’s backlog, which stood at $625 billion at the end of December.\n\nMicrosoft is the first of the Big Three cloud services companies to report quarterly financial results this year. Alphabet Inc. is scheduled to release its earnings on Feb. 4, Amazon.com Inc. the following day.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta Platforms Inc. got a more positive investor reception after saying it’s spending more than anticipated to build out its AI business. As part of its quarterly earnings report Wednesday, Meta, the owner of Facebook, said full-year capital expenditures will be $115 billion to $135 billion, exceeding the $110.6 billion average analyst estimate — and the shares jumped about 7% in extended trading."

While, in the months when food inflation is higher, the new CPI will be lower by 20–30 bps,” the report noted.\n\nA key change in the new CPI series is a sharp reduction in the weight of food and beverages to 36.75 percent from 45.86 percent in the current 2012-based series.\n\nThe combined weight of transport, information and communication, for instance, rises to 12.41 percent from 8.59 percent, while recreation and culture nearly triples to 4.86 percent.\n\nThe new CPI (2024=100) will include 358 weighted items, up from 299 earlier, and adopt the latest COICOP 2018 classification to improve global comparability. Price collection will also expand to online platforms and e-commerce markets, while services such as telecom, OTT subscriptions will be captured more systematically.\n\nThe report comes on the day the Economic Survey noted that inflation, despite having an upward trajectory, is likely to be benign this fiscal and will remain within target levels."

        "full_content": "Big Tech earnings so far this week have sent a clear warning: investors are willing to overlook soaring spending on artificial intelligence if it fuels strong growth, but are quick to punish companies that fall short.\n\nThe contrast was clear in Thursday's stock market reaction to earnings from Microsoft and Meta, highlighting how dramatically the stakes have changed since the launch of ChatGPT started the AI boom more than three years ago.\n\nShares of the Instagram parent surged more than 9% on strong sales, while those of Microsoft slumped 10% after its cloud business failed to impress.\n\nAfter riding its first-mover advantage with OpenAI to become the world's most valuable firm in 2024, Microsoft is now under growing investor pressure to justify its soaring capital outlay.\n\nMicrosoft reported revenue growth in its Azure cloud-computing business that was only slightly above expectations.\n\nIn contrast, AI bolstered ad targeting at Meta, boosting revenue by 24% in the December quarter and aiding a rosy first-quarter forecast. The results show that the Facebook owner's gains from AI were helping fund its capital spending, which is expected to jump as much as 87% to $135 billion this year.\n\n\"Meta's headline numbers are a really interesting reflection of the market's attitude toward spending in the AI space,\" said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.\n\n\"All else equal, the market would typically be concerned, but they have a big revenue guide for the first quarter.\"\n\nMICROSOFT MIGHT HAVE AN OPENAI PROBLEM\n\nMicrosoft also faced pressure after a disclosure that OpenAI, its prized holding, accounts for 45% of its cloud backlog. Investors are worried that some $280 billion could be at risk as the unprofitable startup loses momentum in the AI race.\n\nThe ChatGPT creator had issued an internal \"code-red\" in December after Google's Gemini 3 launched to positive reviews and is playing catch-up in AI coding to Anthropic's Claude Code, which has hit an annualised run rate of more than $1 billion.\n\n\"Microsoft's deep ties to OpenAI underpin its leadership in enterprise AI, but they also introduce concentration risk,\" said Zavier Wong, market analyst at eToro.\n\nMicrosoft predicted Azure growth to stay stable in the period from January to March at 37% to 38%, after slowing in the last three months of 2025, partially due to AI chip capacity constraints.\n\n\"If I had taken the graphics processing units that just came online in the first quarter and second quarter, and allocated them all to Azure, the KPI (growth) would have been over 40%,\" Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood said on a post-earnings call.\n\nShe added that the use of chips for internal development efforts had limited the growth.\n\nMETA BETS ON AI'S COMPOUNDING EFFECT\n\nFor Meta, the revenue growth underscored that its AI pivot was paying off and helping the company catch up to early leaders.\n\nIts revenue rose 24% in the fourth quarter and Meta forecast growth to accelerate as much as 33% in the current quarter.\n\nThe company is racking up bills at large cloud providers, such as Alphabet's Google, which bodes well for the search giant's results next week. Alphabet shares rose 1.6%.\n\nUsing AI \"will both improve the quality of the organic experience and of advertising,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said.\n\n\"I think that will have a compounding effect,\" he added, as Meta predicted a jump of 43% in total expenses this year to $169 billion.\n\nTESLA SET TO DOUBLE OUTLAY THIS YEAR\n\nGrowing spending was also the theme at Elon Musk's Tesla, which will double outlay this year to more than $20 billion as it pivots to AI, humanoid robots and personal vehicles that can drive themselves.\n\nThe company also reported quarterly profit and revenue that were above expectations, pushing its shares up 2.9%.\n\nAnalysts said the results left some mismatch between corporate AI goals and investors' demand for payoffs.\n\n\"The market appears to be questioning whether these massive capital expenditure hikes will generate sufficient returns,\" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.\n\n\"This reflects a growing divide between tech companies' AI ambitions and Wall Street's patience for open-ended investment cycles.\""

The rally was driven by strong demand for safe-haven assets, strong inflows into ETFs, and a weak US dollar,\" Saumil Gandhi, Senior Analyst, Commodities at HDFC Securities told PTI.\n\nHe noted that ongoing geopolitical tensions and global economic uncertainty have reinforced gold and silver's role as preferred hedges against risk, prompting investors to increase allocations to precious metals.\n\nMeanwhile, India's gold demand declined 11 pc in 2025 and is expected to be around 700 tonne this year, weighed down by record-high prices and changing consumer buying patterns, the World Gold Council (WGC) said in a report on Thursday.\n\nOverall gold demand in India fell 11 per cent to 710.9 tonnes in 2025 and is expected to be between 600 and 700 tonnes in 2026, according to the WGC's Full-Year 2025 Gold Demand Trends report.\n\nIn 2024, the overall gold demand stood at 802.8 tonnes.\n\nHowever, in value terms, skyrocketing prices boosted demand by 30 per cent to Rs 7,51,490 crore, compared to Rs 5,75,930 crore in the previous year.\n\n\"India's gold market in Q4 2025 clearly reflected the dual impact of record-high prices and shifting consumer behaviour. Total gold demand for the quarter stood at 241.3 tonne, marking a 9 per cent decline compared to Q4 2024.\n\n\"However, this moderation in volume was more than offset by a sharp rise in value, with overall gold demand increasing 49 per cent year-on-year to approx. Rs 3,03,470 crore,\" WGC Regional CEO, India, Sachin Jain, told PTI.\n\nIn the international market, gold increased USD 177.14, or 3.3 per cent, to touch a fresh peak of USD 5,595.02 per ounce.\n\n\"Spot gold posted its largest-ever intraday gain to hit a fresh record high of USD 5,595, driven by heightened geopolitical tensions after the US President Donald Trump threatened Iran with dire consequences to return to talks to reach a new deal on its nuclear programme,\" Praveen Singh, Research Analyst, Mirae Asset Sharekhan, said.\n\nThe yellow metal prices were also boosted after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that Trump could make an announcement \"in the next week or so\" about who he will pick to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve.\n\nSpot silver advanced sharply, rising USD 3.59, or 3.07 per cent, to hit a lifetime high of USD 120.45 per ounce in overseas trade.\n\nSandip Raichura, CEO of Retail Broking and Distribution & Director, PL Capital, said, \"Gold price movements based on the past may no longer work as we believe the world is witnessing a once in a century phenomenon and therefore gold could head much higher in the next two years, possibly crossing USD 8,000 by 2027.\" According to WGC, global demand for gold has crossed 5,000 tonnes to reach a new all-time high in 2025, mainly driven by investments.\n\nTotal gold demand hit a new all-time high of 5,002 tonnes in 2025, up from 4,961.9 tonne in the previous year, as the investment demand surged to 2,175.3 tonne compared to 1,185.4 tonne in 2024, driven by safe-haven and diversification factors, WGC said."

        "full_content": "India’s quick commerce market is going through a phase of sustained competitive intensity that is distorting growth outcomes, according to Amitesh Jha, chief executive of Instamart.\n\nSpeaking during Swiggy’s Q3FY26 earnings call, Jha said “irrationality” in the market has emerged as a key headwind for growth and is already impacting listed players. He added that Swiggy expects this environment to persist as new entrants continue to spend aggressively on customer acquisition.\n\n“Growth has many reasons for not happening, primarily due to the irrationality in the market, which has impacted both listed players,” Jha said, adding that the company believes such competitive behaviour will continue to weigh on growth in the near term.\n\n‘Good growth’ versus growth bought through discounts\n\nJha was unequivocal in drawing a line between what Swiggy considers healthy growth and growth driven by aggressive discounting.\n\n“We are not going to throw good money at bad growth,” he said, stressing that the company is unwilling to compromise margins in pursuit of headline numbers. While Swiggy could show higher order volumes by deploying more capital, Jha said such growth would not translate into sustainable leadership.\n\n“If our ambition is real market leadership, it is never going to happen by spending tons of good money on essentially buying growth,” he said.\n\nAccording to Jha, discount-heavy strategies are creating behaviour where customers move rapidly between platforms with little loyalty, weakening long-term unit economics.\n\nThat stance was echoed in the company’s shareholder letter, where Sriharsha Majety, group chief executive officer, said recent efforts to lower consumer-side monetisation had failed to deliver meaningful returns.\n\n“Our recent investments into lower consumer-side monetization have not yielded the desired incremental order-growth, especially at the bottom of the AOV-pyramid; and are being reviewed,” Majety said. “We have consciously chosen not to participate in deep-discount-driven, purely-volume-focussed growth that sacrifices AOVs and margins.”\n\nOrder growth without basket expansion a red flag\n\nJha also flagged a structural issue emerging from the current phase of competition: rising order volumes are not being accompanied by stronger consumer engagement.\n\n“Whenever we have seen order growth for any of these platforms, the basket size has not increased. In fact, they have decreased,” he said, arguing that this indicates growth that is neither healthy nor sustainable.\n\nSwiggy, he added, has consciously chosen not to compete in areas where growth is driven primarily by such metrics, even if it means foregoing short-term gains. “We can do more numbers to show higher OPD (orders per day) by putting more money into growth, but we don’t believe that is the right structural growth,” Jha said.\n\nFocus on retention, not discount-seeking users\n\nAs competitive intensity has picked up since October, Jha said Swiggy expects elevated spending by new entrants to continue. However, he expressed confidence that the market will eventually correct as platforms focus more on retention than acquisition.\n\n“New entrants are going after the metric of orders, not on the orders that ultimately matter to end consumers,” he said, adding that retention will ultimately depend on the strength of the core value proposition.\n\nJha said Swiggy is comfortable losing discount-seeking customers in the short term, arguing that long-term loyalty in quick commerce will be driven by assortment depth, availability and speed rather than sustained incentives.\n\n“Investing good money into bad ways to make customers mature is not a priority,” he said, adding that customers acquired primarily through discounts tend to leave once incentives are withdrawn."

We are looking for partners for offloading of shares. We hope to come out with an expression of interest calling interested parties shortly, though we have time till 2030, which is the asset monetisation deadline set by the government,” Arunangshu Sarkar, director—strategy & corporate affairs, ONGC, said on the sidelines of the India Energy Week.\n\nONGC owns 95.69% stake in OPaL while GAIL (India) Limited holds 4.19% stake and Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) another 0.12%. OPaL has a petrochemical complex in Dahej in Gujarat and has a capacity to produce 1.5 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) of polymers and 0.5 mmtpa of chemicals.\n\nIn 2025, OPaL received the final approval for its exit from the Dahej Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and operate as a Domestic Tariff Area (DTA) unit in order to cater to the domestic market.\n\nRecognizing its long-term potential and to address OPaL’s financial challenges, ONGC undertook a capital restructuring of Rs 18,365 crore and exited from SEZ area.\n\nIn parallel, to ensure feedstock stability and reduce reliance on volatile LNG markets, the government had approved allocation of up to 3.2 MMSCM/day of gas from new wells. “These interventions are poised to significantly enhance OPaL’s operational performance and sustainability, positioning it as a value-accretive asset in ONGC’s integrated energy portfolio,” the company had said in its annual report FY25.\n\nThe company sold 1785 KT of petchem products during FY25 against 1769 KT during FY24, while its revenue from operations stood at Rs 14,804 crore during FY25 compared to Rs 14,307 crore during FY24, as per ONGC’s annual report for 2024-25.\n\nThe director said that the upstream major has further planned to develop 50-55 MW (megawatt) of small modular reactors for its own captive use.\n\n“Already we have done EoI (Expression of Interest) and all. We have received a lot of interest. We are planning for 50-55 MW of SMRs that will be used as captive power in our own plants,” Sarkar said.\n\nWhen asked about the company’s plans in LNG sourcing, Sarkar said that the company is targeting both term and spot purchases of gas.\n\nThe company through its joint venture with Japan’s Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd (MOL), has recently signed Ship Building Contracts (SBCs) with Samsung Heavy Industries, South Korea, for the construction of two Very Large Ethane Carriers (VLECs).\n\nSpeaking on the development, Sarkar said that the agreement will ensure regular supply of ethane after Qatar stops supplying rich gas (ethane and propane) starting 2028.\n\nThe capacity of each carrier is expected to be 50 kilo tonnes and will be developed by 2028, Sarkar said. The vessels are expected to transport about 600 KTPA of ethane for OPaL."

        "full_content": "Tata Motors’ largest outbound acquisition—the $4.45 billion buyout of Italian commercial vehicle major Iveco Group—is expected to be completed in the first quarter of FY27, according to a senior company executive.\n\nSpeaking to Moneycontrol on the sidelines of Tata Motors’ December quarter earnings announcement, GV Ramanan, chief financial officer of Tata Motors, said the deal is progressing largely as planned, with regulatory approvals nearing completion.\n\n“We are still in the process of getting approvals from various agencies. Most of the approvals have been secured barring a couple of countries,” Ramanan said.\n\nIn July 2025, Tata Motors, through its commercial vehicle business, announced the acquisition of Iveco Group, the world’s fifth-largest commercial vehicle manufacturer. The transaction marked the company’s biggest overseas deal to date.\n\n“We expect all the approvals to be in place by around mid-March, which was the earlier timeline that we were talking about. Our earlier timeline of completing the acquisition was Q1 FY27, and that is on track,” Ramanan added.\n\nThe company also said the separation of Iveco’s defence business—excluded from the Tata Motors deal—is progressing as scheduled. “From the Iveco side, this has been confirmed very clearly, that the committed timeline will be met,” Ramanan said.\n\nIveco informed shareholders on January 23, 2026, that an Extraordinary General Meeting to authorise the distribution of the net proceeds from the sale of its defence business to Leonardo S.p.A. is expected to be held in the second half of March 2026.\n\nThe company had earlier stated in July 2025 that if the sale to Leonardo is not completed on or before March 31, 2026, it would initiate steps to spin off the defence business through a statutory demerger. Under that plan, the defence unit would be transferred to a newly incorporated entity under Dutch law."

        "full_content": "Digital insurer ACKO Life has announced that it will exclusively sell life insurance that is not linked to investments or income plans, the company founder Varun Dua said in a social media post.\n\nThe life insurance industry usually relies on life insurance products that guarantee fixed income and returns.\n\n“Investment-linked insurance products lure you with the promise of 'getting something back'. Inflated premium, inadequate cover and investment 'returns' that an FD would outperform. At ACKO Life, we made the hard choice of not mixing life insurance,” Acko founder Varun Dua said in a LinkedIn post.\n\nSuch quasi-investment products dilute the original life insurance purpose, while as an investment product, it does not deliver good returns as well, the company said.\n\nDua added that such practices dilute protection with 50 other 'benefits' and add confusion for end-consumers.\n\n“The move positions Acko as an ‘Unmixed’ insurer, prioritising high-value, low-cost life cover as a direct counter to the systemic issues plaguing the Indian insurance sector,” the company said.\n\nAcko’s announcement comes amidst the new insurance bill, which has flagged mis-selling as one of the key issues plaguing the industry. According to recent IRDAI data a 14.3% year-on-year surge in grievances related to Unfair Business Practices (UFBP), or mis-selling.\n\nWhile total life insurance premiums have grown to nearly $100 billion, national insurance penetration has declined to around 2.7 percent of the country’s GDP.\n\nHowever, the high premium masks the widening Mortality Protection Gap—the financial shortfall families face upon the death of a primary earner. This gap has surged 35% since 2017, according to data from a report by the Swiss Re Institute. India’s underpenetration meant that the gap is much wider in the country in practice.\n\nAcko said that by focussing on pure term life insurance, the company is looking to make insurance affordable and transparent. It said that this could help the Bengaluru-based company to drive up the penetration, apart from increasing consumer trust in the sector."

        "full_content": "India’s Economic Survey aims to deliver a comprehensive, data-driven assessment of the economy's performance.Its significance lies in serving as a policy blueprint that flags key challenges and reform priorities to inform Budget decisions and signal government thinking to investors.\n\nAs expected, external challenges occupy considerable space in the latest Economic Survey—understandably so, amid escalating geopolitical tensions, no respite from Trump tariffs, and a weakening rupee (down 6.5% since April 2025) amid volatile capital flows that are roiling the country’s stock market.\n\nThe other major concerns highlighted by the Survey include the high cost of capital, underperformance of manufacturing and its limited integration with global value chains (GVCs), state-level fiscal populism, unbalanced use of agricultural inputs and low farm productivity, urban governance and stressed urban infrastructure, along with issues related to unemployment and public health.\n\nThe Survey argues that the world is shifting toward a phase of“managed disorder,”where trade policy is increasingly shaped by “security considerations” rather than “cost efficiency.” Coercive trade measures are replacing commitment to multilateral trade rules, leading to a realignment of supply chains. In India’s case,services trade surpluses and remittances are insufficientto offset large merchandise trade deficits. As a result, India depends on foreign capital inflows to maintain a healthy balance of payments, and any disruption in capital flows affects rupee stability and investor confidence.\n\nIt further argues that India’s high cost of capital is a structural outcome of persistent current account deficits and dependence on foreign savings. Reducing this cost durably requires transforming India into a“surplus-generating economy” through export-led growth and deeper integration with production networks.While services have been the mainstay, they are not a substitute for a robust “goods-based export ecosystem”. India needs to move from mere “strategic resilience” to“strategic indispensability”by becoming an essential, non-substitutable node in global value chains.\n\nWhat can be expected in the Union Budget\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the following can be expected from the upcoming Union Budget on Sunday:\n\n# The Budget is likely to emphasise the importance of free trade agreements (FTAs) in boosting exports andreiterate its commitment to expediting pending trade deals,especially the one with the US. To support manufacturing competitiveness and goods exports, further rationalisation of import duties is expected to address what is called the inverted duty structure—higher duties on raw materials and intermediates and lower duties on finished goods.Lowering duties on key industrial inputs, such as textile fibres, is expected to reduce production costs for downstream industries.Further withdrawal or rationalisation of Quality Control Orders (QCOs)that make it difficult to source inputs may also be announced.\n\n# We can also expect expansion of the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to more industries to boost exports and support job creation. As the Survey argues that the key to rupee stability lies in exports, the Budget is likely to considerexpanding and strengthening export promotion missions, along with increased export incentives for labour-intensive industries badly affected by Trump’s tariffs. Export facilitation measures, including further rationalisation of customs rules and regulations, can be expected.\n\n# Rising revenue deficits and unconditional cash transfers by states pose risks by “crowding out growth-enhancing capital expenditure”. This fiscal indiscipline at the state level increasingly affects the cost of sovereign borrowing. Therefore, Budget 2026 may further strengthen theSpecial Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI)framework, perhaps by introducing stricter performance-linked conditionalities that reward states for reducing revenue deficits while maintaining capital expenditure.\n\n# Proposals to deepen the corporate bond market—reducing reliance on bank-led debt and lowering the cost of capital for firms—are expected to boost private capex. Some announcements to assure foreign investors on tax certainty are also likely. However, given fiscal constraints, the government is unlikely to reduce or remove long-term capital gains tax that may not be liked by the country’s financial markets.\n\n# Indian crop yields continue to trail global averages due to technological and climatic constraints, as highlighted by the Survey. A major challenge is the distortedN:P:K fertiliser ratio,driven by excessive urea use, which is degrading soil health and lowering productivity. To restore soil health and boost farm output, the Budget may consider aphased re-engineering of the fertiliser subsidy programme.\n\nTaken together, the Economic Survey sets out a clear diagnosis of India’s structural constraints and the reform direction needed to sustain growth in an increasingly fragmented global economy. Budget 2026 is therefore likely to prioritise export competitiveness, lower the cost of capital, reinforce fiscal discipline, and address long-standing productivity challenges across manufacturing and agriculture. The credibility of the Budget will ultimately rest on whether it can translate the Survey’s strategic intent into concrete, implementable policy actions.\n\n(Ritesh Kumar Singh is a business economist and CEO, Indonomics Consulting Private Limited.

        "full_content": "Tesla Inc. will spend over $20 billion on a dramatic reshuffling of factory lines reflecting Elon Musk’s repositioning of the carmaker coming off a multiyear sales slump.\n\nThe capital expenditures planned for 2026 — more than double last year’s outlay and almost twice as much as Wall Street was expecting — will go to ramping up production of cars, batteries and robots across half a dozen plants. To make room for new Optimus humanoids, Tesla will discontinue its two oldest vehicles, the Model S sedan and Model X SUV.\n\n“We’re making very, very big investments,” Musk said on a call after Tesla released better-than-expected quarterly results. Tesla shares rose more than 3% as of 5:35 a.m. Thursday in New York, before the start of regular trading.\n\nTesla also announced a surprise agreement to invest about $2 billion into Musk’s money-losing artificial intelligence startup, xAI, and signaled it’s likely to build a semiconductor manufacturing facility. The moves underscore Tesla’s ambitions to reorient around AI, driverless technology and robots at the expense of its car business, which faces more challenges in 2026 after consecutive annual sales declines.\n\nInvestors have broadly supported the reinvention, even as the new business lines either remain far off or uncertain to succeed. Neither the broader auto industry’s EV winter nor Tesla’s earnings beat garnered much attention on Wednesday’s call.\n\n“This quarter officially marks the fundamental shift from EV company to an all-in bet on robotaxi, energy and Optimus,” said Andrew Rocco, an analyst with Zacks Investment Research. “It looks like they’re almost ready to tear off the Band-Aid on the EV business and go full in on autonomy.”\n\nTesla agreed this month to acquire preferred shares in xAI as part of the closely held company’s latest funding round. The companies also entered into a “framework” accord to strengthen their relationship and “enhance Tesla’s ability to develop and deploy AI products and services into the physical world,” the company said in its earnings release.\n\nThe investment highlights the deepening ties between Musk’s business interests and reinforces the growing focus on AI.\n\nThe xAI agreement will likely be welcomed by many investors and overshadow the earnings results, said Matt Maley, chief market strategist for Miller Tabak + Co.\n\n“If Tesla is going to do as well as the bulls are thinking, it’s going to be with the robotaxi and robotics,” Maley said. “So, this investment is exactly what the bulls wanted to hear.”\n\nWhile Musk has previously voiced support for Tesla investing in xAI, the move follows an unsuccessful shareholder vote on the prospect in November. While more of Tesla’s shareholders voted for a nonbinding measure encouraging an investment, a significant number of abstentions meant the measure didn’t pass. Still, Tesla said then that it would continue to explore the possibility.\n\nThe two companies already work together. Tesla has sold Megapack energy storage systems to xAI, and xAI’s Grok chatbot is integrated into some Tesla vehicles. Bloomberg reported earlier this month that xAI told investors its aims to build AI will eventually power humanoid robots such as Optimus.\n\nTesla’s adjusted earnings dropped to 50 cents a share in the quarter, exceeding analysts’ average estimate. The company snapped a streak of four quarters in which profit on that basis was weaker than expected.\n\nMusk has previously warned Tesla was headed for a rough patch navigating lower EV demand and waning US subsidies. While the company is finally bringing its long-planned Semi truck to market this year and will soon start making its two-door, two seat Cybercab, production of the Model S and X will wind down in the next quarter. The S, which costs about $95,000, and the X, with a price tag of nearly $100,000, are much lower-volume vehicles compared with Tesla’s more affordable 3 and Y models.\n\nThe profit beat helps offset disappointment stemming from a steady decline in vehicle sales. Tesla earlier this month reported a 9% decline in 2025 deliveries. The company ended the year with a 16% quarterly vehicle sales drop, its steepest decline yet.\n\nAn increasingly crowded EV market, the end of US tax credits for EV purchases and a backlash against Musk’s polarizing politics and his role in the Trump administration contributed to the company’s woes.\n\nOne of the company’s lucrative revenue streams — selling regulatory compliance credits to other carmakers — also is coming under pressure, with sales falling 22% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. That income has dropped since the US eliminated penalties for automakers exceeding fuel-economy standards.\n\nDue to the regulatory credit revenue slide and drop in vehicle deliveries, Tesla’s annual revenue declined for the first time.\n\nThe company reported for the first time that it has 1.1 million active subscribers for its Full Self-Driving system, the suite of assistance features that drivers need to constantly supervise. Musk announced recently that FSD will transition to a subscription-only model starting next month.\n\nTesla said it aims to deploy robotaxis in Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Orlando, Tampa and Las Vegas in the first half of this year. The only city where the company has offered rides without safety drivers is Austin, and the business fell well short of Musk’s predictions for expansion last year.\n\nThe company also operates a ride-share service via the same app in the San Francisco Bay area with safety drivers behind the wheel. It’s already secured permits for testing in Nevada and Arizona."

We have sharpened our competitive edge through stronger innovation and focused brand building, leading to healthy market share gains. As demand conditions improve, the combination of favourable macroeconomic indicators and expectations of supportive policy measures, reinforced by recent GST changes, positions us well for the quarters ahead, and we remain confident of delivering sustainable growth, resilient profitability, and continued shareholder value,\" said Malhotra.\n\nConsumer demand has been gradually improving in India, multiple consumer firms have said, as a sustained moderation in inflation and the government's income tax cuts increase appetite for spending.\n\nDabur's consolidated net profit rose 7% to Rs 560 crore for the quarter ended December 31. Analysts had expected, on average, Rs 556 crore, as per LSEG data.\n\nTotal revenue grew 6% to Rs 3,559 crore.\n\nThe company took a one-time hit of 150.5 million rupees due to the implementation of India's new labour codes, the biggest overhaul of workers' laws in decades.\n\nOn January 29, Dabur India shares closed 1% lower at Rs 510 apiece.

        "full_content": "For many Indians, owning a house is still one of life’s biggest financial goals. Earlier, people often waited until retirement to build a home using their savings. Today, easier access to home loans means many people start construction much earlier, even while they’re still building their careers.\n\nIf you’re planning to construct a house on your own plot, it’s important to know how homeloansfor self-construction work, when EMIs begin, and how tax benefits really apply.\n\nCan you get a home loan for building a house?\n\nYes, but with a few differences.\n\nBanks and housing finance companies generally treat loans for ready-to-move homes and under-construction flats similarly when it comes to interest rates, tenure and broad eligibility. The key difference is in how the money is released.\n\nFor self-construction on your own land, fewer lenders are willing to finance the project. Those that do usually offer either a construction loan or a composite loan that covers both the plot and the construction cost.\n\nIn such cases, the lender does not hand over the full loan amount upfront. You are expected to first put in your share of the money. The loan is then disbursed in stages, linked to the progress of construction.\n\nHow disbursements actually happen\n\nMoney is released in tranches as construction moves ahead. To trigger each disbursement, you typically need to submit certificates from your architect or civil engineer confirming the stage of construction. Photographs of the site are also commonly required.\n\nSome lenders go a step further and send their own engineer to verify progress instead of relying only on your documents. This can slow things down slightly, but it’s standard practice.\n\nThe important thing to remember is that cash flow planning matters. You need enough funds to keep construction moving between disbursements.\n\nMany borrowers assume EMIs begin only after construction is fully completed. That’s not always true.\n\nWhile regular EMIs usually start once the entire loan has been disbursed, you may still have to pay interest on the amount already released during the construction phase. This is known as pre-EMI interest.\n\nPre-EMI payments are interest-only and do not reduce the principal. They can stretch for months or even years, depending on how long construction takes.\n\nWhat tax benefits can you claim?\n\nTax benefits for a self-construction home loan depend heavily on timing and the tax regime you choose.\n\nUnder Section 80C, you can claim up to Rs 1.5 lakh a year for principal repayment, along with other eligible investments. However, principal repayments made before the construction is completed do not qualify for this deduction.\n\nThere’s another catch. If you sell the house within five years from the end of the financial year in which you take possession, all the principal-related deductions you claimed earlier are reversed and added back to your income in the year of sale. This benefit is available only under the old tax regime.\n\nWhat about interest deductions?\n\nInterest on a home loan is treated more generously.\n\nYou can claim interest under Section 24(b) only after the construction is completed and you take possession of the house. But the interest you paid during the construction phase is not lost. It can be claimed in five equal instalments, starting from the year the house is completed, along with the regular interest for that year.\n\nFor self-occupied houses, the maximum interest deduction is Rs 2 lakh a year under the old tax regime. If construction is not completed within five years from the end of the year in which the loan was taken, this limit drops sharply to Rs 30,000.\n\nIf the property is let out, you can claim the full interest amount, although losses that can be set off against other income are capped at Rs 2 lakh a year.\n\nUnder the new tax regime, interest deduction is not available for self-occupied houses, and losses from house property cannot be adjusted against other income.\n\nOne small but important relief\n\nUnlike principal repayment benefits, interest deductions claimed under Section 24(b) are not reversed if you sell the house within five years of completion. That distinction often gets overlooked.\n\nBuilding your own house with a home loan can work well, but it requires careful planning. Disbursements are staggered, EMIs don’t always wait for completion, and tax benefits depend heavily on timelines and the tax regime you choose.\n\nBefore you begin construction, it helps to map out not just the cost of the house, but also how cash will flow during the build and when tax benefits will actually kick in. A little clarity upfront can prevent a lot of confusion later."

        "full_content": "As the Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran had indicated in an opinion piece ahead of the Economic Survey, geopolitics and global uncertainty emerged as defining themes of the report. While these forces pose clear risks to India,the Survey underscored the imperative of strengthening domestic fundamentals to cushion against external shocks—recognising that the global environment may yet deteriorate. As the proverb goes,a house built on strong foundations can withstand any storm.\n\nThe first job was to ascertain how big the problem might get. To this end, the survey outlines three scenarios of various risk intensities. The ‘best-case’ scenario of a ‘managed disorder’, which was allocated 40-45% probability, final stress episodes, trade frictions and geopolitics introduce volatility and government intervention but do not trigger a systemic collapse.\n\nAlmost similar probability was allocated to the second scenario, which involved a disorderly multipolar breakdown, where geopolitical tensions intensify and countries face trade-offs between stability, growth and autonomy.\n\nA third and severe scenario, which received a 10-20% probability outlined a 2008 GFC-like effect, with broader risk-aversion with financial market as well as real economy implications.\n\nIndispensability through manufacturing\n\nBeyond the stage-setting, the survey portrayed inherent optimism on the Indian economy’s ability to fight these risks. While a lot of arguments were presented, there was a strong case for a single-minded focus on expanding manufacturing capabilities. Interestingly, manufacturing was framed as a \"disciplining system\" that would force improvements in logistics, power, and regulation because production failures in this sector are immediately and externally visible.\n\nThe emphasis was also on the economy finding its key bargaining chip, which will contribute to its “strategic indispensability”, i.e., integrate the Indian economy so deeply into global networks that others are invested in its continued functioning. This requires moving beyond assembly to high-tech manufacturing, as seen in the India Semiconductor Mission, which aims to secure domestic capacity in the \"heart\" of modern technology.\n\nThere were also suggestions on finetuning the AI adoption strategy to domestic realities. Instead of focusing on expansion of heavy compute infra which will not only add to the debt stock, but also strain existing resources, the preferred route would be to undertake a bottom-up AI strategy focused on application-specific, small models that are computationally efficient and tailored to local needs in health, agriculture, and education.\n\nState capacity and economic growth\n\nIn midst of these myriad changes, the survey does not lose sight of the importance of building the depth and quality of state capacity, particularly about the state’s ability to execute plans through administrative judgment and technical competence. After all, this was one of the reasons why aggressive increase in allocations towards capex spending, especially infrastructure, is ill-advised before strengthening capacity. In this context, the Survey identifies bureaucratic risk aversion as a significant hurdle, where good-faith decisions are often subjected to retrospective scrutiny, leading to policy inertia. To counter this, it advocates for the \"Entrepreneurial State\"—one that acts under uncertainty, learns from systematic experimentation, and corrects course without paralysis. It goes to provide the required reforms to enhance state capacity.\n\nIn all, the Economic Survey pegged FY27 GDP growth at 6.8% to 7.2%, slightly higher than street estimates, from a projected 7.4% in FY26. The FY27 Budget might undertake smaller steps to achieve few of the objectives outlined in the survey. Along with strong growth, the authorities will be keen to build and assert their strategic influence over time, with an immediate need to strengthen shock absorption mechanisms. An undervalued rupee for one does not seem to be raising the hackles for the time being.\n\n(Views are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.)"

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey's headlines are unabashedly positive, reiterating India's status as the world's fastest-growing major economy. GDP growth for the current fiscal year is 7.4%, though it is projected to moderate to between 6.8% and 7.2% over the next two fiscal years; the lower end of this range aligns with the IMF's estimates.\n\nSignificantly, the Survey reckons that potential growth has risen to 7% from current levels of 6.5%. Given current economic trajectories, this should translate into per capita income growth of over 5%. Furthermore, inflation is described as \"tamed and anchored,\" which may pave the way for interest rate cuts.\n\nIt hails the resilience of the Indian economy post the imposition of the ‘penal’ tariff of 25 percent by President Trump, raising the total 50%. It hails the slew of structural reforms, including the cut in GST and the implementation of the new labour codes. ”A sense of dynamism has taken hold in the government,” the survey says, seemingly crediting the economic reforms to the pressure created by the tariffs.\n\nThe survey posits that potential economic growth has risen from 6.5 percent to 7 percent boosted by sustained economic reforms intended to boost ease of doing business. Major steps include FDI reforms, the introduction of production-linked schemes (PLI), improving logistics, and simplifying tax laws. This has been supplemented by sustained investment in both physical and digital infrastructure. Effective capex in physical and digital, according to the survey, has reached 4 percent of GDP.\n\nAll this will lead to a rise in total factor productivity, a rise which translates into higher growth. TFP is something of a holy grail among economists. A rise in TFP implies greater efficiency due to smarter combinations of inputs of capital and labour. The survey estimates TFP growing at 1.9 percent between FY 26 and FY30, up from 1.7 percent in the immediate post-pandemic years.\n\nThat's only a return to the 1.9 percent growth between FY12-13 and FY 19-20, though. Similarly, the survey calculates a growth in capital stock of 7.6 percent in the next five fiscal years, higher than the 1.7 percent in the post-covid years. Between FY13 and FY20, growth was 7.6%.\n\nOngoing reforms, notably the free trade agreements (FTA) signed with the EU, UK and others, should further boost productivity. So should the investments in both physical and digital productivity.\n\nThe learning-by-doing, which will accompany the growth of new sectors such as semiconductors, electronics (a major success of the PLI policy) and defence equipment, should also help.\n\nThe survey argues that the cost of capital is high in India for structural reasons, namely the fact that the country has a persistent current account deficit. As a result, it needs to attract foreign capital for which it needs to pay a risk premium. Energy costs, too, need to come down.\n\nNonetheless, Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GDCF) now stands at 30.5 percent of GDP above the pre-pandemic average of 28.6 percent. GFCF as a percentage of GDP had been declining from FY13 to FY20 and further during the pandemic years, a trend that has now reversed.\n\nBoth consumption and investment are anchoring growth, the survey reiterates. The former stands at 61.5 percent of GDP in the first half of the current fiscal year, the highest since FY12.\n\nHowever, the Survey is far from Panglossian and posits that India is operating below its full strategic potential. Notably, the rupee is described as punching below its weight, causing foreign investors to pause.\n\nThe rupee's performance does not reflect India's \"stellar economic fundamentals\", according to the survey. It also flags the risk of what it refers to as \"disorderly multipolar breakdown\".\n\n“The paradox of 2025 is that India’s strongest macroeconomic performance in decades has collided with a global system that no longer rewards macroeconomic success with currency stability, capital inflows, or strategic insulation,” the survey complains.\n\nThe Survey also reiterates social concerns mentioned in previous editions, such as digital device addiction and obesity. It also flags the relatively low pay of gig workers, a topic of much recent debate.\n\n“The paradox of 2025 is that India’s strongest macroeconomic performance in decades has collided with a global system that no longer rewards macroeconomic success with currency\n\nstability, capital inflows, or strategic insulation,” the survey complains. Reducing imports sustainably by emulating the success of the electronics industry, which the survey hails, in other areas could resolve the conundrum."

        "full_content": "As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, tax experts are increasingly calling for a reset of India’s long-term savings incentives, arguing that existing provisions have failed to keep pace with inflation, rising living costs and evolving employment patterns.\n\nA key area where taxpayers are demanding change is Section 80C of the Income-tax Act, which is available under the old tax regime, where the Rs 1.5 lakh deduction limit has remained unchanged for over a decade. Experts say this ceiling no longer reflects the financial realities of middle-class households that are simultaneously managing housing costs, education expenses and retirement planning. There is a strong expectation that Budget 2026 could raise this limit and extend enhanced deductions to the new tax regime as well, ensuring that long-term savings do not lose relevance as the simplified regime becomes the default.\n\nAccording to SR Patnaik, the current structure of Section 80C mixes long-term savings instruments with other eligible payments, diluting its effectiveness as a retirement-focused incentive. He believes carving out a separate, higher deduction exclusively for long-term savings could strengthen retirement readiness across income groups.\n\nBeyond deductions, experts are also pushing for reforms in capital gains and interest income taxation to revive investor confidence. Hari Raheja argues that long-term capital gains relief, preferential tax treatment for longer-tenure fixed deposits, and the reintroduction of tax-exempt dividends could meaningfully boost participation in financial markets. He also points to the need for innovative savings avenues, such as gold deposit schemes, and more liberal reinvestment limits in housing to channel household wealth into productive assets.\n\nThere is also growing support for separating genuine long-term savings from the crowded Section 80C basket. Ritika Nayyar notes that when multiple instruments compete for the same deduction limit, taxpayers often prioritise liquidity or deadline-driven options over long-term goals. A dedicated sub-limit for retirement-oriented products such as PPF, NPS and long-dated government bonds, she says, could encourage disciplined, goal-based saving and reduce the tendency for last-minute tax planning.\n\nBalancing long-term lock-ins with flexibility for younger investors remains another policy challenge. With job mobility and gig work becoming more common, experts stress that tax incentives must reward patience without trapping capital indefinitely. Gradually increasing tax benefits with longer holding periods, allowing limited early withdrawals, and enabling portability across jobs are seen as practical ways to make long-term saving less intimidating for younger earners.\n\nFor B. Shravanth Shanker, inflation-adjusted thresholds are critical to restoring the relevance of tax exemptions. He highlights the need to raise interest income deductions for both individuals and senior citizens, revisit stagnant homeloaninterest limits, and introduce targeted long-term capital gains relief to encourage genuine wealth creation. Importantly, he also flags gaps in the new tax regime, where the absence of dedicated retirement deductions could inadvertently weaken future financial security if left unaddressed.\n\nTaken together, these proposals point to a broader shift that experts hope Budget 2026 will initiate: moving tax policy away from fragmented, short-term incentives towards a clearer framework that rewards long-term commitment, supports retirement planning, and aligns household savings with India’s long-term growth needs."

        "full_content": "India is the world’s fastest-growing major economy. The real question is, do you want to simply watch that growth, or actually own a part of it?\n\nThe difference between where you put your money can be dramatic. The same Rs 1 lakh could grow into Rs 10 lakh over time, or remain stuck closer to Rs 3 lakh, depending on how you invest. That gap is where stocks come in.\n\nFor many young Indians, especially Gen Z, the stock market still feels intimidating or premature. But understanding how the stock market works often changes that perception.\n\nA brief history of stock investing\n\nStock investing isn’t a modern invention. It began in the 1600s in Amsterdam, when the Dutch East India Company became the first firm to issue shares to the public, allowing ordinary people to own a piece of a business.\n\nIndia’s own stock market journey started in 1875 with the formation of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Today, India has two major exchanges, the BSE and the NSE, with millions of investors trading daily. From Infosys in the 1990s to Zomato’s IPO in 2021, equities have become the primary way Indians participate in the growth of companies they interact with every day.\n\nHow the stock market actually works\n\nAt its core, the stock market is a marketplace for ownership. When you buy shares of a company like Reliance or TCS, you are buying a small stake in that business.\n\nShare prices move based on demand and supply. If more investors want to buy a stock, its price rises; if more want to sell, it falls. Companies raise capital by issuing shares, and investors benefit as those businesses grow and become more profitable. When done right, it’s a mutually beneficial system, companies get funding, and investors get a chance to build wealth.\n\nWhy stocks deserve a place in your portfolio\n\nThere are four key reasons stocks remain one of the most powerful wealth-building tools:\n\nBeating inflation:Inflation in India averages around 5-6 percent. If your money is parked in savings accounts or fixed deposits earning similar returns, your purchasing power barely grows. Equities, on the other hand, have historically delivered returns of 10-12 percent over the long term, helping money grow faster than rising prices.Capital growth:Equities allow investors to participate in the growth of successful businesses. Early investors in companies like Infosys saw wealth creation that traditional instruments could never match.Dividend income:Some companies share profits with shareholders through dividends, offering a steady stream of passive income in addition to price appreciation.Diversification:You don’t need to bet on a single stock. Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds allow investors to spread money across sectors such as technology, pharma, and FMCG, reducing risk while staying invested in equities.\n\nIs your 20s too early to invest? Actually, it’s ideal\n\nIf there’s one word young investors should remember, it’s compounding. The earlier you start, the longer your money has to multiply. Starting in your 20s gives your investments decades to grow, dramatically increasing the final outcome. Waiting until your 30s or 40s can significantly reduce that potential.\n\nStocks are no longer just for seasoned traders or “Dalal Street veterans.” They are for first-job earners, startup dreamers, and digital natives who want their money to work as hard as they do.\n\nStart small. Stay consistent. Let time and compounding do the heavy lifting. Because while the best time to invest may have been yesterday, the second-best time is today."

        "full_content": "India’s use of Quality Control Orders (QCOs) has expanded sharply over the past five years, with the number of products covered more than tripling since 2019, the Economic Survey 2025 noted on January 29.\n\n“As of December 31, 2025, a total of 143 QCOs covering 723 products have been notified by various ministries, more than three times the coverage of 214 products in 2019,” the Survey said. The objective of QCOs is to ensure that products sold in the domestic market meet stipulated quality standards, while avoiding market distortions and safeguarding consumer interests, it further added.\n\nThe Survey credited QCOs with delivering tangible gains in certain sectors. In toys, for instance, stricter quality norms helped curb sub-standard imports while also supporting the development of a domestic manufacturing base and boosting exports.\n\nHowever, the Survey cautioned that design and execution are also important, particularly given the structure of India’s industrial ecosystem. “While the rationale is clear, the design and implementation of QCOs should be grounded in economic practicality,” it said, warning that mandatory certification is not cost-free and can create frictions if rolled out without adequate preparation.\n\nThis risk is especially pronounced for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which account for a large share of India’s manufacturing base. Sudden or poorly sequenced certification requirements can raise compliance costs, disrupt production cycles and strain working capital for smaller firms, the Survey noted.\n\nThe document also flagged challenges arising from globalised supply chains.\n\n“QCOs on intermediates therefore require exceptional caution,” the Survey said, stressing the need for flexibility where domestic capacity does not exist, particularly given the complexity of modern global production networks.\n\nTo address these concerns, the Survey called for a forward-looking QCO framework with rigorous pre-notification assessments, calibrated transition timelines and adequate expansion of national testing and certification infrastructure."

        "full_content": "India can do far more to unlock the potential of its concert and live entertainment economy by streamlining permissions, opening up heritage venues for events and easing the participation of foreign artists, the Economic Survey 2025-26 said on January 29.\n\nThe Survey noted that live entertainment in India has staged a strong post-pandemic rebound, with the segment crossing Rs 10,000 crore in revenues in 2024.\n\nThe Survey places the concert economy within the broader framework of the “Orange Economy”—economic activity driven by creativity, culture and intellectual property, where value is derived primarily from ideas and artistic expression rather than physical goods.\n\nThe Survey noted that international evidence shows that live concerts are high-multiplier activities that generate economic value well beyond ticket sales.\n\n“Globally, live music accounts for nearly one-third of total music revenues. In the United States, the live music industry generated over $130 billion and supported more than 900,000 jobs in 2019. In the UK, music tourism alone contributed £6.6 billion ($8.1 billion) in 2022—around 0.3 percent of GDP—highlighting strong spillovers to hospitality, transport and retail,” it said.\n\nCreative industries contribute between 0.5 percent and over 7 percent of GDP.\n\nThe survey highlighted a shortage of large-scale live event venues, restrictions on foreign payments to overseas performers, and the requirement for 10-15 separate clearances for organising events.\n\nTo address these gaps, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is working on a Single Window Mechanism for Live Entertainment Permissions, including approvals from state governments. The Survey also suggested opening heritage monuments for events and easing visa and foreign-exchange approvals for international artists.\n\nWith better facilitation and integration into tourism and city-branding strategies, the Survey said, the concert economy could emerge as a meaningful driver of growth for media and entertainment, tourism and allied urban services."

They tell you the policy lapsed, but the premium you paid has supposedly grown into a much larger amount. All you need to do, they say, is buy a new policy so the money can be “transferred” and refunded.\n\nIt sounds tempting. It is also completely false.\n\nFirst things first: Bima Lokpal does not call you\n\nThe Insurance Ombudsman, also called the Bima Lokpal, does not call policyholders to offer refunds. No government body, regulator or ombudsman reaches out to individuals and promises them with unclaimed insurance money.\n\nThey do not ask you to buy new policies. They do not route refunds through fresh investments. And they certainly do not promise windfalls over phone calls.\n\nAny caller claiming otherwise is lying.\n\nThese scams are effective precisely because the caller sounds extremely confident. Fraudsters often have access to old policy data. They may know your name, the year you bought the policy and even the premium amount. When they give all these details to you over the phone, it lowers your guard.\n\nThey also create urgency. You are told the money will be refunded only if you act quickly. This pressure is deliberate. It is meant to stop you from checking independently.\n\nIf you feel rushed, that itself is a warning sign.\n\nThe biggest red flag: “Buy a new policy to get your money”\n\nThere is no legitimate insurance process where you must purchase a new policy to unlock or refund money from an old one. Once you pay for a new policy, the money is usually gone, and the promised refund never shows up.\n\nThis “transfer-and-refund” story is entirely made up.\n\nHow lapsed policies actually work\n\nIf your old policy was a traditional plan like an endowment or money-back policy, and it lapsed before it built any surrender value, the premiums are typically forfeited. There is nothing to refund.\n\nIf it was a Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP), the fund value does not disappear. When the policy lapses, the money moves into a discontinuation fund. That amount can be withdrawn only after five years, and only after applicable charges are deducted.\n\nIn neither case does Rs 50,000 magically become Rs 5 lakh.\n\nIf you want to know the status of an old policy, contact the insurance company directly. Use the official customer care number or website listed on the insurer’s own page. You can check whether any fund value exists and whether anything is payable.\n\nDo not rely on unsolicited calls. Do not share documents, OTPs or personal details. And never make payments based on promises of refunds.\n\nThis is a scam, plain and simple. In insurance, guaranteed windfalls, urgent deadlines and requests to buy new policies to release old money are classic warning signs. When in doubt, cut the call and check directly with the insurer. If the money is real, it will still be there tomorrow."

        "full_content": "The past few weeks have seen a heated discussion over the earnings and the working conditions of gig workers in India, with several data staffing agencies and online platforms defending the delivery model.\n\nThe Economic Survey, released on January 29, has now waded into the debate and shared its findings. According to the Survey, 40 percent of the total gig workers in the country earn less than Rs 15,000 per month, which is way below what several previous reports and company claims have said. The earning is also below the entry-level salary paid under the 7th Pay Commission.\n\nMoreover, the Survey highlighted concerns of algorithmic biases and burnout. “Platform algorithms control work allocation, performance monitoring, wages, and supply-demand matching, raising concerns about algorithmic biases and burnout,” it said.\n\nThe Survey noted that the gig workers have increased in the country rapidly in the last few years, jumping 55 percent from 77 lakh in FY21 to 1.2 crore in FY25, representing 2 percent of India’s total workforce. The government document credited smartphone penetration and over 15 billion monthly UPI transactions for the growth in the number of gig workers.\n\nClose to half of the gig workers at 52 lakh are employed by the e-commerce and logistics sectors. The Survey said the non-agricultural gigs are projected to make 6.7 percent of the workforce by 2029-30, contributing Rs 2.35 lakh crore to the gross domestic product.\n\nThe Survey pointed out several income and financial inclusion issues that still persist.\n\nInside Blinkit, Zepto and Instamart’s speed engine: How your quick commerce orders really arrive in 10 minutes\n\n“While the gig economy is booming, income volatility persists, leading to challenges in accessing credit. Financial inclusion also lags behind for gig workers. They have ‘thin-file’ credit access, which remains a concern,” the Survey said.\n\nThe gig economy’s rapid expansion offers unprecedented opportunities for revenue generation. However, the challenges need to be addressed to ensure equitable growth, the Survey noted.\n\nThe Survey said the recently implemented Labour Codes recognize gig and platform workers and provides various social security benefits.\n\nNo more 10-minute delivery: Centre steps in, asks Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy to drop time limit\n\nIn the past few weeks, several critics had raised concerns over long-working hours and low salary of gig workers employed by several online platforms such as Zomato, Swiggy, Zepto and others.\n\nEternal’s chief executive officer Deepinder Goyal, set to retire as the group CEO next month, had publicly defended the delivery model of gig platforms, including Zomato and Blinkit.\n\nIn a post on X, Goyal had shared data on rider earnings and several other metrics to counter the allegations of unfair wages. According to Goyal, a gig worker working for 10 hours every day for 26 days would have a gross earning of Rs 26,500 and a net earning of Rs 21,000 after considering fuel and other costs.\n\nEternal CEO Deepinder Goyal defends gig pay model with earnings, safety data\n\nA Zomato delivery worker’s earnings per hour recorded a close to 11 percent hike to Rs 102 in 2025, according to Goyal’s data.\n\nThe debate over gig workers had escalated after the riders announced a nationwide strike on December 25 and 31, which theplatforms claimed was not successful. Following the outrage, the Central government stepped in and asked delivery platforms to shelve the 10-min delivery promise."

        "full_content": "As Budget 2026 approaches, household investors are not looking for dramatic tax cuts or new exemptions. What they want instead is clarity, tax rules that allow them to invest according to their risk profile.\n\nOver the past two years, industry experts say changes in the taxation of investment products have quietly altered investor behaviour. While some of these measures were introduced in the name of parity or simplification, the result for many retail investors has been confusion and, in some cases, higher risk-taking.\n\nDebt funds and the conservative investor dilemma\n\nOne of the clearest examples is debt mutual funds. After indexation benefits were removed in 2023, debt funds lost much of their appeal for long-term investors seeking stability and tax efficiency.\n\nRahul Bhutoria, Director and Co-founder of Valtrust, says the impact was swift. “When indexation benefit for debt mutual funds was removed in March 2023, long-term investors stepped back, leading to weakening of inflows,” he notes. For conservative households, debt funds no longer serve as a reliable low-risk allocation in the way they once did.\n\nImportantly, the change did not significantly alter bank deposit behaviour. According to Dr. Gaurav Kulshreshtha, Chief Investment Officer, Nexedge Capital, bank deposit growth has continued at around 10-12 percent year-on-year. What has changed is where conservative money is going.\n\n“In the pursuit of better post-tax returns, conservative capital is increasingly moving toward higher credit risk or unintended equity exposure,” Kulshreshtha says. This shift, driven largely by tax outcomes rather than suitability, undermines traditional asset allocation principles in personal finance.\n\nRestoring capital gains taxation for debt mutual funds and similar products is therefore a key expectation from Budget 2026, not to boost returns, but to re-establish debt as a sensible option for low-risk investors.\n\nEquity investing: STT plus Capital Gains Burden\n\nTax complexity is not limited to debt. Equity investors today deal with multiple layers of taxation across the investment lifecycle, from Securities Transaction Tax at purchase to expense ratios during holding and capital gains tax at exit.\n\nManish Kothari, CEO of ZFunds, believes simplification is long overdue. “A more streamlined tax structure across these layers would improve transparency, reduce confusion, and ease the overall burden on investors,” he says. For retail investors, understanding true post-tax returns remains a challenge.\n\nHybrids and pension funds: similar goals, different tax outcomes\n\nHybrid mutual funds add another layer of inconsistency. Two hybrid schemes with similar risk-return profiles can face very different tax treatment due to technical classification thresholds. “Two products delivering similar outcomes should not face different tax outcomes,” Kothari argues, adding that taxation should reflect the economic nature of the product rather than rigid definitions.\n\nA similar mismatch exists in retirement planning. He explains, “Pension-oriented mutual funds and the National Pension System (NPS) both aim to provide post-retirement security, yet differences in tax treatment often push investors toward one product purely for tax reasons.”"

        "full_content": "ACKO Life on January 29 announced a strategic shift away from traditional life insurance models, committing exclusively to “pure protection” products as it seeks to address rising mis-selling and widening under-insurance in India.\n\nAccording to a press release, the move comes against the backdrop of a 14.3 percent year-on-year increase in mis-selling-related grievances across the insurance sector, as reported in the latest IRDAI Annual Report. By adopting what it calls an “unmixed” model, ACKO Life will offer only pure term life insurance products, consciously staying away from bundled insurance-investment offerings such as ULIPs and savings-linked policies.\n\nThe company said its approach is aimed at prioritising consumer protection over product complexity, positioning itself as a life insurer defined by what it refuses to sell rather than by product diversification.\n\nThe announcement comes at a time when the Indian life insurance sector is facing a structural contradiction. While total life insurance premiums have grown to nearly $100 billion, life insurance penetration has stagnated, declining to around 2.7 percent of GDP in FY25. Industry experts describe this as a situation where India is “insured on paper but unprotected in reality”.\n\nThis gap is reflected in the country’s growing mortality protection gap — the financial shortfall families face after the death of a primary earning member. According to the Swiss Re Institute, Asia’s mortality protection gap has widened 35 percent since 2017 to $132 billion, with India among the most vulnerable markets.\n\nACKO Life said decoupling insurance from investment is critical to addressing this deficit, arguing that mixed products dilute protection through high premiums, complex structures and lower cover values.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post, Varun Dua, Founder of ACKO, criticised investment-linked insurance products, stating that they often create an illusion of returns while delivering inadequate protection.\n\n“Life insurance has one job: to protect your loved ones from uncertainty. At ACKO Life, we made the hard choice of not mixing life insurance. We refuse to dilute protection with 50 other ‘benefits’ because we believe it doesn’t add any value. It only adds confusion,” Dua said.\n\nACKO Life said its “pure-play” strategy is designed to simplify consumer decision-making and improve insurance penetration by offering high-value, low-cost term cover focused solely on financial protection.\n\nFounded in 2016, ACKO entered the life insurance segment in 2023 after receiving regulatory approval, following its expansion across auto, health and travel insurance through a digital-first, direct-to-consumer model."

This marks a 48 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall from the Rs 1,355 crore net profit reported in the same period last year.\n\nThe CV-maker’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose more than 16 percent YoY to Rs 21,847 crore during the quarter under review. Operating margin improved to 12.60 percent in Q3 FY26 from 12.07 percent in Q3 FY25, while profit margin reduced to 3.23 percent.\n\nTata Motorsreported a 30 bps increase in consolidated EBITDA to 12.5 percent during the October-December quarter of the ongoing FY26.\n\nCommercial vehicles are used for a wide range of activities, from construction and freight to public transport and mining. Lower prices helped fleet operators go for long-delayed replacement of older vehicles, analysts quoted by Reuters said.\n\nThe earnings however were impacted by some exceptional losses. The firm incurred a one-time cost of Rs 962 crore to account for the stamp  duty charges payable to various local authorities to effect transfer of registration of land acquired as part of the its demerger scheme.\n\nAdditionally, the company also incurred a one-time cost of Rs 603 crore due to the implementation of the new labour codes, which took effect last year, along with Rs 82 crore for acquisition.\n\nOverall, the company incurred exceptional costs worth Rs 1,643 crore during the quarter.\n\nThe tax cuts helped boost domestic sales of commercial vehicles by 22 percent during the December quarter, with Tata's rising 18 percent, Reuters reported.\n\nThe company's overall sales grew 21% in the October-December period, boosting revenue to Rs 20,315 crore from Rs 16,897 crore the year before.\n\nTata Motors said its CV segment wholesales stood at 1,16,800 units, marking a 20 percent rise. Domestic and export volumes were up by 18 percent YoY and 70 percent YoY, respectively.\n\n\"Overall domestic CV VAHAN market share grew 100 bps sequentially to 35.5% for Q3FY26,\" the firm said.\n\nGoing forward, Tata Motors expects demand to further strengthen in Q4 FY26 across most commercial vehicle segments. Key drivers in 2026 will include the government’s sustained infrastructure push and expansion in end-use sectors, both of which are expected to fuel positive momentum for the industry, the company said.\n\n\"With an optimized portfolio ensuring superior product availability, a decisive pricing strategy, and deeper customer engagement through intensified market activations, Tata Motors is wellpoised to unlock demand across segments, paving the way for continued success,\" it added.\n\nHere's what the management said:\n\nSpeaking about the company's performance during the quarter, Tata Motors MD & CEO Girish Wagh said, \"Disciplined execution of an agile strategy delivered yet another strong financial performance this quarter, supported by demand tailwinds from GST 2.0 and the festive season. Our recent launch of 17 next-generation trucks under the ‘Better Always’ philosophy sets new benchmarks in safety, total cost of ownership, and smarter, emission-free mobility, reinforcing our commitment to innovation and industry leadership. With infrastructure spending accelerating, we are well positioned to sustain momentum and drive continued growth.\"\n\nThe company's CFO GV Ramanan meanwhile said, \"We delivered another strong quarter, translating robust operational execution and healthy demand across key segments into meaningful financial outcomes. The quarter marked significant milestones, including our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit EBITDA margins and achievement of double-digit EBIT margins. This strong operating performance coupled with disciplined working capital management, led to robust free cash flow generation.

The survey said the scheme provides structured incentives for shipbuilding within India, addressing cost disadvantages faced by domestic yards in global markets dominated by a few large players.\n\nSBFAS also includes a shipbreaking credit note of Rs 4,001 crore, aimed at promoting environmentally responsible recycling and supporting green shipbuilding practices. This aligns the shipbuilding push with India’s broader environmental and sustainability objectives, particularly as global shipping standards tighten around emissions and recycling norms.\n\nDedicated maritime financing architecture\n\nTo address long-standing financing constraints in the sector, the government has approved a Maritime Development Fund (MDF) of Rs 25,000 crore. According to the survey, the framework is intended to strengthen long-term sectoral financing, attract investment and promote public-private partnerships across shipbuilding and allied maritime activities.\n\nThe MDF comprises a Maritime Investment Fund of Rs 20,000 crore, with 49 percent participation from the Government of India, and an Interest Incentivisation Fund of Rs 5,000 crore designed to lower financing costs and improve project viability. The structure is aimed at crowding in private capital while reducing risk for lenders in a capital-intensive sector with long gestation periods, the survey said.\n\nScaling capacity and technology depth\n\nThe Shipbuilding Development Scheme (SbDS), with an outlay of Rs 19,989 crore, seeks to expand India’s shipbuilding capacity to 4.5 million gross tonnage annually. The survey said the scheme supports the development of greenfield mega shipbuilding clusters, modernisation of existing shipyards, and the provision of risk and insurance support for shipbuilding projects.\n\nIt also envisages the establishment of an India Ship Technology Centre to help develop domestic capabilities in shipbuilding design, manpower training, research and development, and coordination of testing facilities.\n\nAs part of the broader reform package, large ships above a specified size were included in the Infrastructure Harmonised Master List in September 2025. The move is intended to ease access to long-term finance by allowing eligible projects to tap infrastructure-linked funding channels, the Economic Survey said."

        "full_content": "Nearly 72.66 percent of India’s crypto trading volume that stood at Rs 51,252 crores in FY25 went to global offshore exchanges, revealed a survey released on January 29 by crypto tax compliance platform KoinX.\n\nThis coincided with the time when several banned global exchanges had just started registering with the Finance Ministry’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-Ind) to service Indian customers.\n\nKoinX surveyed 670,608 of its users between FY24-25, reporting an overall trading volume of Rs 70,536 crores.\n\n“Our dataset includes user-reported activity across both domestic and international exchanges commonly used by Indian traders, including Binance, Bitget, Bybit, BingX, Gate.io, KuCoin, MEXC, Coinbase, and Kraken, among others,” Punit Agarwal, Founder and CEO, KoinX told Moneycontrol.\n\nAgarwal added that FIU registration and TDS deduction are two distinct aspects wherein having a registration doesn’t always translate into immediate or consistent transaction-level TDS deduction.\n\n“During FY 2024–25, we’ve seen KuCoin, Coinbase has been deducting TDS, while TDS deduction across international exchanges has not been uniform,” he said.\n\nInterestingly, the respondents cumulatively reported Rs 6,394 crores in total profits from trades in spot, margin and futures while total losses stood at Rs 4,781 crores.\n\nDespite incurring losses, about 49.09 percent of users ended up paying Rs 180 crores in 30 percent taxable capital profits as losses could not be offset. These users saw net capital losses of Rs 1178 crores.\n\nFor Union Budget 2026, the crypto industry is seeking 30 percent capital gains tax rationalisation, provision for loss offset and re-evaluation of the 1 percent tax deducted at source (TDS).\n\nIndian exchanges directly deduct 1 percent TDS on all virtual digital asset transactions. At present, the TDS threshold is about Rs 10,000 per year for most categories of taxpayers, individuals and traders; and Rs 50,000 per year for small traders and specified persons.\n\nTotal TDS collected was at Rs 511.83 crores, out of which KoinX users contributed over Rs 130.16 crores (25.43 percent). Less than 5 percent of the users paid 87 percent of total TDS deducted.\n\nThe 1 percent TDS levied on transactions accounted for only about 0.60 percent of the overall turnover on domestic exchanges.\n\n“The 1% TDS on crypto transactions has become a significant liquidity factor in the Indian crypto market… This figure reflects transaction volume, not profitability. TDS is deducted per trade, making it a proxy for trading activity, not net gains,” the report noted.\n\nAgarwal explained, “During FY 2024–25, ₹19,280 crore of trading volume in our dataset occurred on Indian exchanges. Since TDS is deducted at 1% on sale transactions, the total TDS collected reflects only sell-side activity on domestic platforms, not total turnover.”\n\n“Additionally, a significant share of overall trading volume occurs on international exchanges, which further explains why TDS collections appear low relative to total trading volume,” he added."

In October 2024, the cabinet approved a  Rs 1,000-crore venture capital fund under IN-SPACe to support space startups, followed by the launch of a Rs 500 crore Technology Adoption Fund in February next.\n\nIn the startups sector, Skyroot Aerospace and Agnikul Cosmos have conducted successful sub-orbital launches in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Several startups, including Pixxel Space, Azista, Hex20 and TakeMe2Space, have successfully launched satellites, the survey said.\n\nMore than 70 technologies have been transferred from Isro to private industry, helping firms scale up production and enter commercial markets, it said, adding foreign investment norms have also been liberalised.\n\nThe survey positions private participation as central to India’s long-term space ambitions under Space Vision 2047, which includes the Bharatiya Antariksh Station by 2035 and a crewed lunar mission by 2040.\n\nUpcoming missions such as Chandrayaan-4, Chandrayaan-5/LUPEX, the Venus Orbiter Mission and the Next Generation Launch Vehicle will create further opportunities for industry collaboration and technology development.\n\nThe Economic Survey 2025–26, prepared under the supervision of chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran, was tabled in Parliament by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman."

        "full_content": "The key takeaway from the Economic Survey 2025-26 tabled in Parliament on Thursday is that the India’s macroeconomic sweet spot, which is the outcome of sustained economic reforms, is being tested by geopolitics and a changing global order.\n\nAn undertone of confidence in domestic demand and growth comes through in the resilient 6.8-7.2 per cent growth projection for FY2027. The Survey also revised the potential growth rate up to 7.0 per cent from 6.5 per cent three years ago attributing credit to reforms and public investment. “Growth is good; the outlook remains favourable; inflation is contained; rainfall and agricultural prospects are supportive; external liabilities are low; banks are healthy; liquidity conditions are comfortable; credit growth is respectable; corporate balance sheets are strong; and the overall flow of funds to the commercial sector is robust. Policy dynamism and purposeful governance reinforce this backdrop.”\n\nIndia exits a turbulent FY2026 and enters FY2027 in a position of macroeconomic strength, domestic growth, anchored inflation, and improving fiscal health. The survey takes cognisance of reforms across taxation, financing institutions, capital markets, digitisation, and infrastructure which helped medium-term stability.\n\nHowever, in the backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions, what built India’s resilience to keep the growth engine is infrastructure. The document reiterates the Centre’s 89 per cent increase in capital outlay from Rs 5.92 lakh crore in FY2022 to a budgeted allocation of Rs 11.21 lakh crore for FY2026.\n\nHighlighting the importance of investing in roads, railways, ports, airports, it states that the multiplier effect in economic growth is most pronounced in infra capital expenditure (capex). This means, for every rupee spent by the government in creating infrastructure, GDP gains worth Rs 2.5-Rs 3.5.\n\nThat said, when public capital expenditure on infrastructure has expanded significantly, the end-result depends upon quality of project plans and execution. Cost overruns as a result of delays in execution, incomplete reports or inaccurate assessments are a given.\n\nAnother pertinent point made is the calibrated shift needed by the private sector, mainly in manufacturing, from a model that looks to import substitution towards one that focuses on scale, competitiveness innovation and integration into the global value chains. Here, the survey calls out India Inc. for its unwillingness to take risks that are beneficial in the long run.Companies need to step on the capex pedaland take bigger risks, make investments with longer time horizons, become globally competitive, and avoid rent-seeking, oligopolistic tendencies. It needs to increase private sector investment in research and development, technology adoption, skills, and quality systems.\n\nIndia’s industrial journey could be more fruitful if it aligns to the new geopolitical changes, supply-chain realignments, reworked trade agreements between nations and a more protectionist and fragmented global order.\n\nThis time around, the survey has gone a step further from being an annual narrative of economic health and the outlook ahead to a 799-page report that enlists how the government and industry should walk the talk.\n\nOf course, there’s no brushing aside the persistent weakness in the Indian rupee amid the domestic macroeconomic buoyancy. At present, in spite of dollar weakness, the INR is flirting with the 92 mark to the USD. My colleagueManas Chakravarty explains the reasons.\n\nThe biggest comfort in FY26 came from benign inflation that looks “anchored and tamed”. How long will this trend last?Read here.\n\nIndeed, a Survey document this long may have taken hours of burning the midnight oil to collate but will take even longer for investors to digest and extrapolate into investment decisions. Little wonder then that Indian equities surged initially to record daily highs before settling lower, just a tad above the previous day’s closing.

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey 2026 has called for the active use of “economic statecraft”, urging the government to strategically deploy economic tools to advance India’s foreign policy, national security and long-term strategic interests.\n\nThe emphasis comes as India remains among the world’s fastest-growing major economies for the fourth consecutive year.\n\nWhile underlining the relevance of economic statecraft in today’s geopolitical environment, the survey notes that the concept itself is far from new.\n\nIt specifically cites Chanakya, also known as Kautilya, and his seminal work Arthashastra as one of the earliest and most systematic treatises on statecraft, integrating economic governance with political and strategic imperatives.\n\nAccording to the survey, Arthashastra demonstrates how economic instruments such as trade regulation, taxation, resource management and state control were historically used to strengthen state power and achieve strategic objectives.\n\nBy invoking Chanakya, the survey places India’s modern economic strategy within a long civilisational tradition of linking economic policy to national security and diplomacy.\n\nThe survey also refers to historical examples beyond India, including the Megarian Decree imposed by ancient Athens and the Roman Empire’s grain provisioning system, Cura Annonae, as instances where economic measures were used to achieve strategic and political ends.\n\nExplaining the concept, the survey defines economic statecraft as the deliberate use of economic means to achieve strategic outcomes. Unlike conventional economic policy, which focuses on goals such as controlling inflation, managing deficits and promoting growth, economic statecraft goes further by using economic tools to influence the behaviour of other states, protect national security, or reshape geopolitical outcomes.\n\nIn the modern context, the survey notes that economic interdependence, once seen as a stabilising force, is increasingly viewed as a source of vulnerability. Pandemic-related disruptions, the weaponisation of energy and finance during global conflicts, and the growing use of export controls in advanced technologies have exposed the limits of efficiency-driven globalisation.\n\nAs a result, both advanced and emerging economies are reassessing their dependence on concentrated supply chains, critical raw materials and key technologies, often framing these shifts through the lens of national security. The Economic Survey argues that India must consciously use economic statecraft, rooted in both historical wisdom and contemporary realities, to navigate an increasingly contested global order."

Between April-August FY26, Indian companies made investments worth $10.2 billion ,compared to $7.9 billion in the corresponding period last year.\n\n“The persistence of outflows despite global financial uncertainties underscores ongoing internationalisation by Indian enterprises,” CEA V Ananth Nageswaran said.\n\nThe survey states that between April 2023-August 2025, nearly 82 percent of cumulative ODI (Overseas Direct Investment) of $48.3 billion was directed to the top ten destination countries of Singapore (27 percent), the United States (16 percent), UAE (10 percent), Mauritius (9 percent) and the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (7 per centeach), reflecting both strategic-asset seeking in advanced markets and the use of international financial hubs.\n\nThe survey also pointed out that despite tighter financing conditions and heightened geopolitical uncertainty, FDI inflows to developing economies remained broadly stable at $867 billion (57 percent of global FDI) in CY 2024.

Results were announced in the post-market hours.\n\nArun Misra, Executive Director, Vedanta, said, “Q3 FY26 has been a landmark quarter for Vedanta, delivering our highest-ever EBITDA of Rs 15,171 crore, with two of our businesses achieving their best-ever financial results. Aluminium posted its strongest EBITDA margin of $1,268 per ton, supported by record alumina and aluminium production. Zinc India recorded its highest-ever quarterly EBITDA of Rs 6,064 crore, driven by record mined and refined metal output, with silver contributing 44% of overall profit. Zinc International also reported a 28% YoY increase in production, led by Gamsberg achieving its highest-ever recovery. Our Oil & Gas business reached a major milestone with India’s first subsea template installation, while our Thermal Power Business delivered 188% YoY EBITDA growth with a 62% increase in sales volumes. Steel and Ferrochrome Business also achieved record production of steel billets at 285 kt, and ferrochrome output up 32% YoY.

We delivered our highest-ever quarterly PAT of Rs 7,807 crore, marking a strong 60% YoY growth. Our Q3 revenue stood at a record Rs 45,899 crore, up 19% YoY, while EBITDA reached an all-time high of Rs 15,171 crore, growing 34% YoY. EBITDA margins expanded sharply by 629 bps YoY to 41%. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen, with Net Debt to EBITDA improving to 1.23x from 1.40x YoY. The reaffirmation of our AA credit rating by CRISIL and ICRA following the NCLT demerger order, along with upgrades in VRL credit rating outlook from Stable to Positive by S&P, Moody’s & Fitch Ratings, underscore the market confidence in Vedanta’s growth trajectory. We are now entering an exciting phase of growth and value unlocking, creating long-term value for all our stakeholders.”\n\nAluminium prices were supported as Chinese producers faced higher costs amid winter power curtailments and tighter environmental rules across the supply chain, analysts at Elara Capital said in a research note.\n\nLower inventories and production disruptions in major producer China are expected to keep aluminium prices firm in the near term, the brokerage added.\n\nThe benchmark three-month aluminium, zinc, and copper on the London Metal Exchange rose 11.8%, 5.3%, and 21% on-year, respectively, in the reporting quarter.\n\nHigher commodity prices tend to support selling prices and margins for mining companies.\n\nVedanta's operating profit margin rose to 27% from 22%.\n\nRevenue from Vedanta's aluminium segment rose 10.2%, while its combined zinc and lead India segment rose 16%. The copper segment improved by 48.9%.\n\nVedanta's aluminium business is the biggest in India by production volume, and contributes to nearly 40% of the company's revenue.\n\nEarlier this month, Vedanta's subsidiary Hindustan Zinc posted a higher third-quarter profit on strong silver and zinc prices.\n\nVedanta Ltd is the world's leading producer of metals, oil & gas, critical minerals, power and technology."

        "full_content": "The insurance sector has grown at a robust pace but costs, too, have increased steadily, with a significant portion of premiums being consumed by distribution overheads, the Economic Survey 2025–26, released on January 29, has said.\n\nWhile the total premium income scaled up sharply in FY25, growing to Rs 11.9 lakh crore from Rs 8.3 lakh crore in FY21, the survey said despite the push for digital transformation, customer acquisition continues to depend heavily on expensive intermediary networks instead of technology leading to cost rationalisation.\n\nThe central argument in the survey is that both life and non-life insurance segments are not taking advantage of digitisation to support both acquisition costs and restore ‘value for money’ to the policyholder.\n\nStructural challenges: high operating cost\n\nBeyond the industry’s success in deepening revenue from existing customers, the survey flagged a decline in insurance penetration to 3.7 percent. High distribution costs are preventing a widening of the risk pool. It is essential to lower overall costs and distribution outgoes to improve affordability to tap into the \"missing middle\" and reverse the decline in penetration.\n\nAccording to the survey, this structural constraint helps to understand why the escalating cost blocks the insurance sector’s evolution, creating distortions that limit inclusion, erode consumer value, and threaten long-term stability. The survey acknowledges that the cost of acquisition is not merely an operational friction.\n\nThe survey also draws a sharp distinction between private life insurers and the non-life sector's high-cost model strategies, posing a risk to the core financial strength of insurers.\n\nThe insurance sector has matured into one of the economy's deepest institutional pools of long-term capital but remains constrained by a \"low-penetration, high-cost\" equilibrium driven by a high-cost distribution model, it said.\n\n“Even after years of digital investment, most policies are still sold through high-commission agents and intermediaries, which makes insurance more expensive for customers. That’s why we see a strange trend— people who already buy insurance are spending more, but overall coverage is not expanding much,” said Alay Razvi, Managing Partner, Accord Juris.\n\nThe survey said insurers are not taking advantage of the digitisation of distribution to support both acquisition costs and restore ‘value for money’ to the policyholder.\n\n“As a result, a significant portion of insurance premiums is consumed by distribution overheads rather than being channelled towards risk coverage, product innovation, or improved claims servicing,” said Atul Menon, Partner, King Stubb & Kasiva, Advocates and Attorneys."

        "full_content": "If you invest in equities for long enough, one thing becomes clear very quickly: no single segment leads the market every year. Large caps do well in some phases, mid caps shine in others, and small caps can swing from stellar to painful within short periods.\n\nThat’s why many investors prefer funds that give exposure across market capitalisations instead of betting on just one segment. Flexi-cap and multi-cap funds are designed for exactly this purpose. On the surface, they sound similar. In practice, they behave very differently.\n\nWhy diversification across market caps matters\n\nRecent years are a good reminder of why diversification helps. In 2025, large-cap stocks delivered steady returns, mid caps were more muted, and small caps struggled. In other years, the order has been completely reversed.\n\nSince it’s almost impossible to consistently predict which segment will outperform next, spreading exposure helps smooth the journey and improves the odds of sensible long-term returns.\n\nBoth flexi-cap and multi-cap funds aim to do this, but they take different routes.\n\nWhat a flexi-cap fund really does\n\nA flexi-cap fund invests across large-, mid- and small-cap stocks, but without any compulsory allocation to each category. As long as at least 65 percent of the portfolio is in equities, the fund manager is free to decide where the money goes.\n\nThis flexibility is the key feature.\n\nIf the fund manager believes large caps are safer or better valued, the portfolio can tilt heavily in that direction. If mid and small caps look attractive, exposure can be increased there instead. The allocation can change meaningfully over time as market conditions and valuations shift.\n\nIn other words, with a flexi-cap fund, you are trusting the fund manager to actively move money between market-cap segments.\n\nHow multi-cap funds work differently\n\nMulti-cap funds follow stricter rules. They must invest at least 75 percent of their assets in equities, with a minimum of 25 percent each in large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap stocks at all times. The remaining 25 percent is flexible.\n\nThis structure ensures constant exposure to all three segments, regardless of market conditions. Even if small caps are expensive or volatile, the fund still needs to maintain that minimum allocation.\n\nThe upside is balance. The downside is limited flexibility.\n\nWhy this difference matters in real life\n\nIn a flexi-cap fund, the fund manager can actively reduce exposure to overheated segments and move to safer or better-valued areas. This can help manage risk during frothy phases, but it also means returns depend heavily on the manager’s judgement.\n\nIn a multi-cap fund, allocation discipline is built in. You always stay diversified, but the fund cannot fully step away from a struggling segment even if valuations look stretched or risks are rising.\n\nThis is why multi-cap funds can feel more volatile during sharp small-cap corrections, while flexi-cap funds may appear relatively calmer in the same phase.\n\nWhat the return numbers tell you — and what they don’t\n\nCategory-level data shows that multi-cap funds have delivered stronger returns than flexi-cap funds over some longer periods. But this doesn’t mean multi-cap funds are always better.\n\nIndividual fund performance varies widely. A well-managed flexi-cap fund can outperform many multi-cap funds, and vice versa. What matters more is whether the fund’s structure matches your comfort with risk and your expectations from the fund manager.\n\nPast returns are useful for context, not decision-making on their own.\n\nBoth flexi-cap and multi-cap funds are equity-heavy and suit investors with a long-term horizon, ideally five years or more.\n\nA flexi-cap fund may suit you if you are comfortable letting the fund manager make allocation calls and are okay with the portfolio looking very different from year to year. This works better for investors who trust active decision-making and can live with periods of underperformance.\n\nA multi-cap fund may suit you if you want built-in diversification across market caps at all times and prefer a more rule-based structure. You accept that the fund will always have exposure to all segments, even during tough phases.\n\nFlexi-cap and multi-cap funds are not competing products so much as different philosophies.\n\nOne relies on flexibility and fund manager judgement. The other relies on discipline and balance. Neither is inherently superior. The right choice depends on how much control you want the fund manager to have, how comfortable you are with volatility, and how patiently you can stay invested through market cycles.\n\nIf you understand what each fund is designed to do, choosing between them becomes much simpler."

It had reported a revenue of Rs 5,561 crore in the previous quarter.\n\nIn comparison, its chief rival Zomato posted a 73 percent YoY rise in quarterly profit at Rs 102 crore in the December quarter, while its revenue rose 202 percent YoY to Rs 16,315 crore.\n\nSwiggy's adjusted EBITDA loss for the quarter stood at Rs 712 crore for the December quarter, up 45 percent from Rs 490 crore in the year ago period. This figure stood at Rs 695 crore in the previous quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, its total expenses increased nearly 49 percent YoY to Rs 7,298 crore in the quarter ended December, up from Rs 4,898.3 crore a year ago and Rs 6,711 crore a quarter ago.\n\nThe platform's average monthly transacting users (MTUs) grew 37 percent YoY to 24.3 million during the quarter, from 17.8 million in the year ago period.\n\nThe firm's food delivery revenue rose 22 percent YoY to Rs 2,277 crore in Q3FY26, from Rs 1,860 crore a year ago. Meanwhile the gross order value (GOV) of this vertical grew over 20 percent YoY to Rs 8,959 crore, from Rs 7,436 crore in Q3 FY25.\n\nRevenue for Swiggy's quick commerce business, Instamart, rose 74 percent to Rs 1,052 crore on an annual basis, from Rs 603 crore in Q3 FY25. GOV growth accelerated to almost 103 percent YoY to Rs 7,938 crore. It had reported a GOV of Rs 3,907 crore in the year ago period, and Rs 7,022 crore in the previous quarter.\n\nHowever, the company added just 34 dark stores during the quarter, taking its total store count to 1,136. In comparison, Zomato added 211 new stores in the December quarter, taking its total dark store footprint to 2,027.\n\nOn January 29,Swiggy sharesclosed nearly flat at Rs 323.85 apiece.

After an initial downtick, the Nifty drifted lower in early trade; however, buying interest in heavyweight stocks across sectors helped pare losses and eventually pushed the index into positive territory. As a result, the benchmark settled near the 25,418 level, up by 0.30 percent. Sectoral trends were mixed, keeping participants engaged, with metals, energy and banking stocks edging higher, while FMCG, pharma and IT names remained under pressure. The broader market took a breather after two sessions of rebound and ended largely unchanged.\n\nMarket sentiment stayed cautious as investors awaited key domestic events, including the Economic Survey and the upcoming Union Budget. Global uncertainty, mixed corporate earnings and continued foreign institutional selling weighed on risk appetite, while weakness in the Indian rupee added to the cautious undertone. That said, resilience in select heavyweight stocks helped limit the downside and enabled the index to sustain its recovery.\n\nThe Nifty continues to hover around the long-term moving average, the 200 DEMA, with the ongoing tussle reflecting indecision at these levels. Having crossed the immediate hurdle around 25,350, the index now appears poised to inch towards the 25,600 zone. Strength in the banking index is playing a key role in the rebound, with other sectors providing support on a rotational basis. However, participants should avoid getting carried away by the recovery and remain selective, focusing on performing sectors and themes while keeping position sizes in check amid lingering geopolitical uncertainty and the approaching Union Budget.\n\nRupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities\n\nAfter initial weakness, the Nifty gained strength and closed higher. Overall, it maintained its position above the 50 EMA on the hourly chart. The RSI has remained in a positive crossover on the hourly timeframe.\n\nWith Friday being the last trading session ahead of the Budget, a relatively contained movement can be expected. On the higher end, 25,500 is likely to act as a crucial resistance. On the lower end, immediate support is placed at 25,200, below which a sharp decline may be seen in the market.\n\nAbhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza\n\nToday, the Indian stock markets recovered strongly, after a volatile start. The Sensex ended 221 points higher at 82,566, while the Nifty 50 closed above 25,400.\n\nThe recovery was driven by three key factors. First, the recently finalized India–EU FTA boosted market sentiment. Second, FIIs turned buyers after selling for 15 straight sessions, investing Rs. 480 crore in the cash market.\n\nDIIs continued to provide strong support, with inflows of Rs. 3,360 crore, helping stabilize the market. Third, the Economic Survey 2025-26 reassured investors about India’s macro strength. It projected GDP growth of 7.4% in FY26 and 7.2% in FY27, highlighted low inflation, improved bank asset quality, and continued government capital spending to support growth.\n\nSector wise, metal stocks outperformed sharply, led by Hindustan Copper, supported by strong commodity prices and infrastructure demand expectations. In contrast, IT stocks declined, while FMCG and auto stocks saw mild profit booking. Looking ahead, markets may remain volatile until the Union Budget.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey 2026 indicates a major shift in India's household financial savings over the past decade, reflecting a fundamental change in how additional financial resources are allocated.\n\nThe transition is characterised by a steady shift towards market-linked instruments, especially equities, reflecting both structural changes in the financial system and changing household risk preferences, the survey, tabled in Parliament on January 29, has said.\n\nThe evolving equity orientation is also evident in the flow of household financial savings. Between FY12 and FY25, gross financial savings increased substantially, accompanied by a notable reallocation across instruments.\n\n\"The share of equity and mutual funds in annual household financial savings increased from around 2 percent in FY12 to over 15.2 per cent in FY25. This shift has coincided with a steady rise in SIP contributions, with average monthly SIP flows increasing seven times from under Rs 4,000 crore in FY17 to over Rs 28,000 crore in FY26 (April-November),\" it said.\n\nEquity investments, once secondary to household balance sheets, are now a major part of financial wealth, supported by broader participation and more diverse access channels. The growth of debt-linked instrument markets is a logical next step toward achieving balanced, diversified portfolios and meeting long-term financial objectives.\n\nThe growing prevalence of systematic investments reflects a shift towards long-term and sustained household engagement with savings being channelled in a disciplined manner across market cycles. In contrast, the share of term deposits declined from over 58 percent in FY12 to around 35 percent in FY25, after having fallen to as low as 31.9 per cent in FY22, the survey said.\n\nThis pattern indicates portfolio diversification rather than displacement, with households adding equity exposure to their existing savings instead of completely substituting away from traditional instruments.\n\nA notable aspect of the move to equities is the growing proportion of individuals in total equity market ownership, accomplished through both direct and indirect means.\n\n“The share of individual investors increased from around 11 percent in FY14 to 14.3 percent in FY19, and further to 18.8 per cent by September 2025. In absolute terms, individual equity holdings expanded to around Rs 84 lakh crore by September 2025, from just Rs 8 lakh crore in FY14,” it said.\n\nWhile the direct participation of individuals in equity markets grew slowly, rising from just under 8 percent in FY14 to around 9.6 percent by September 2025, the indirect share nearly tripled, reaching 9.2 percent during the same period. From April 2020 to September 2025, household equity wealth is estimated to have grown by about Rs 53 lakh crore. This highlights how ongoing engagement in the markets has been crucial for long-term wealth building."

        "full_content": "The next phase of India’s industrial growth will depend less on protection and more on scale, technology adoption, innovation and deeper integration into global value chains, the Economic Survey 2025-26, tabled in Parliament on January  29, has said.\n\nThe survey pegs manufacturing as central to India’s long-term growth ambitions, as global supply chains undergo structural realignments. Competitiveness is increasingly determined not by low-cost labour alone but by technological capability, reliability and strategic relevance within global production networks, it said.\n\nFor India to emerge as a high-productivity manufacturing hub, the survey emphasised the need for stable, innovation-friendly policies and sustained reforms across ease of doing business, R&D and innovation, skilling, infrastructure and logistics, and MSME scaling.\n\nA key recommendation is to move toward mission-driven manufacturing policy through the National Manufacturing Mission. The survey positioned the mission as the long-term blueprint to expand manufacturing capacity, accelerate technology adoption and deepen MSME integration into domestic and global supply chains.\n\nThe long-term vision is ambitious, targeting a doubling of manufacturing’s share in GDP to 25 percent by 2035, generating around 143 million jobs and pushing merchandise exports toward $1.2 trillion.\n\nThe survey also recommended continuing targeted incentive-based industrial policy in strategic sectors through schemes such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) programme.\n\nPLI schemes, now spanning 14 sectors with an outlay of Rs 1.97 lakh crore, have already helped attract more than Rs 2 lakh crore in investments, generate incremental production of over Rs 18.7 lakh crore and support employment generation of more than 12.6 lakh, it said.\n\nThe policy signal is that targeted, scale-linked incentives can help anchor global supply chains in India when combined with domestic capability building.\n\nBeyond incentives, the survey favoured innovation-led manufacturing. It stressed the need for India to transition from a technology adopter to a global innovator, supported by initiatives such as the Anusandhan National Research Foundation and research and innovation funding mechanisms aimed at crowding in private R&D investment and accelerating capability development in strategic sectors.\n\nThe survey also linked manufacturing competitiveness directly to infrastructure and logistics efficiency. Initiatives such as PM GatiShakti and the National Industrial Corridor Development Programme are critical to reducing logistics costs, improving supply chain reliability and enabling large-scale industrial growth. Infrastructure is positioned not just as a growth enabler but as a core determinant of manufacturing competitiveness.\n\nAnother recommendation is to accelerate MSME integration into larger value chains. Long-term manufacturing growth and job creation will depend on the ability of smaller firms to scale, adopt technology and participate in global supply networks rather than remain fragmented and domestically focused, it said."

        "full_content": "The current state of private investment and signals about its likely trajectory make up an important strand of the Survey. In this context, it identifies the cost of capital as an important influence on the level and growth of private investment.\n\nOver a 30-year period (1995 to 2025), the weighted average interest rate in India averaged 7.61%. It was much higher than Switzerland’s 1.04% but far lower than that of another emerging market, Indonesia, where the rate was 14.1%.\n\nLink between CAD and interest rates\n\nThe Survey unpacks the factors that influence the level of interest rates and concludes that the most important structural explanation for India’s relatively high cost of capital is linked to the overall savings position. This, in turn, has its roots in a persistent current account deficit (CAD). Consequently, there’s a risk premium which is priced into interest rates as well as equity returns.\n\nThe point here is that India’s persistent CAD is undermining industrial competitiveness and acting as a drag on investment. Find a way to get rid of this deficit on the external front and an important drag on investment goes away.\n\nIndia doesn’t do too badly when it comes to CAD, particularly when seen in a global context. At a little over 1% of GDP, India’s current CAD level puts it in the same category as Australia or UK.\n\nThe primary reason for it is that the services exports have been the foundation on which the Balance of Payments has coped with multiple shocks over the last six years.\n\nIn FY25, services exports hit a record of $387.5 billion and the trade surplus in this segment was $188.8 billion.  It is this surplus which offset about two-third of the merchandise trade deficit. Take away services exports from the equation, the situation would have been precarious.\n\nYet, services exports are treated with a lens that may have been relevant in another era but is inconsistent with evidence across the world.\n\nAccording to Survey, services are not a substitute for a goods-based export ecosystem that underpins resilient currency and external stability.\n\nWhy? Services exports do not compel broad upgrades in state capacity, argues the Survey.\n\nWhat global evidence teaches us\n\nEven within India, the pressure on state governments, Karnataka being the prime example, to upgrade their ability to cope with urban demands suggests otherwise.\n\nThat said, there’s a more important reason why the Survey and, by extension, the general policy approach underestimates the importance of what services can do for the Indian economy.\n\nThe World Bank in 2021 took a look at the changing nature of global development in a report titled‘At Your Service? The Promise of Services-Led Development’.\n\nAmongst its key findings were that the line of demarcation between services and manufacturing was increasingly hazy. A classic example of manufacturing prowess such as the automobile industry is no longer free of services inputs.\n\nFor example, the World Bank report said that software-related services contributed 40% of the value of a 2010 GM Chevy Volt model. If anything, the contribution of the services industry in automobiles will only represent a much larger value in future.\n\nEven in the case of China, the global manufacturing powerhouse, data tells us a counterintuitive story. The number of jobs and wages supported by the export of business services exceeds that of manufactured goods in China. That is the case in India too.\n\nOne legitimate complaint about services is that is not a monolith. A lot of services in India are characterized by limited value addition and low wages. Even that is not a good enough for policy making to underestimate the contribution of services.\n\nData from the World Bank report shows that labour productivity in informal services has been consistently higher than agriculture since 1990.\n\nNone of these facts support a case for ignoring manufacturing when it comes to policy and resource allocation. But these facts do make a case that India’s’ on to a good thing when it comes to services. Therefore, it’s unwise to underrate its potential and, thereby, pay inadequate attention to what makes it work.\n\nThat’s precisely what the debate about Bengaluru’s urban woe is."

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey 2025–26 has suggested that the government could consider amending the definition of a “government company” under the Companies Act to enable greater equity monetisation from central public sector enterprises (CPSEs), while retaining effective control through special resolution rights.\n\nThe Survey pointed out that current legal constraints are limiting further disinvestment in a significant share of listed CPSEs. “Currently, in about 30 per cent of listed CPSEs, Government shareholding is already below 60 per cent, limiting further disinvestment through OFS, as it is stipulated in the Companies Act that a ‘government company’ must have at least 51 per cent of its stake held by the central or state government,” it said.\n\n“Going forward, receipts from equity monetisation can be strengthened by selectively reducing Government equity in certain CPSEs beyond the minimum public shareholding norms,” the Survey said, adding that such decisions should be “guided by market conditions and enterprise-specific factors”.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey in Parliament on January 29.\n\nThe Survey noted that effective control does not require majority ownership. “Since effective control requires only about a 26 per cent stake, the Government could consider amending the definition of ‘Government Company’ under the Companies Act, limited to listed entities, to allow them to remain as government companies with a minimum of 26 per cent ownership,” it said.\n\nSuch a change, the Survey said, would allow the government to “retain special resolution rights, while enabling the government to monetise its stake”. This approach, it added, could unlock additional equity monetisation without diluting strategic control over key enterprises.\n\nAlternative route: phased exit without legal change\n\nThe Survey also outlined an alternative path if the government’s objective is eventual privatisation. “Alternatively, if the objective is eventual privatisation, the Government could continue phased OFS below 51 per cent and even towards full exit, without changing the legal definition of ‘government company’,” it said.\n\nThis approach would enable CPSEs to operate after disinvestment “as professionally managed entities with dispersed ownership, clear governance standards, and transparent succession frameworks,” the Survey noted.\n\nRecycling disinvestment proceeds\n\nThe Survey further suggested that disinvestment receipts could be channelled towards future-oriented investments. “A portion of disinvestment receipts could also be earmarked for strategic investments in emerging technology and innovation-driven companies through professionally managed platforms such as the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), thereby recycling public capital toward future growth sectors,” it said.\n\n“This will also ensure a steady stream of disinvestment receipts into the future,” the Survey added.\n\nStrategic disinvestment progress\n\nAccording to the Survey, strategic disinvestment has proceeded in a calibrated manner in recent years. “Since 2016, in-principle approval has been accorded for strategic disinvestment for 36 CPSEs, of which 13 transactions have been completed, with the remainder at various stages of implementation,” it said.\n\nDuring FY26, the government also moved ahead with stake dilution and exits from select joint ventures. “During FY26, approvals were also accorded for stake dilution or exit from select joint ventures, including NTPC’s divestment from Utility Powertech Limited,” the Survey said.\n\nThese steps, it added, were supported by broader governance reforms. “These actions were complemented by governance reforms that empowered CPSE Boards to undertake the closure, merger, or disinvestment of subsidiaries,” the Survey said.\n\nTaken together, the Survey’s assessment suggests that a combination of legal flexibility, calibrated disinvestment and governance reforms could expand equity monetisation options for the government, while strengthening CPSE governance and redeploying public capital towards emerging growth areas."

        "full_content": "The government’s decision to replace the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) stems from deep-seated structural and implementation failures, despite the programme’s success in boosting rural incomes and assets, the Economic Survey said on January 29.\n\nWhile acknowledging that MGNREGS played a critical role in enhancing rural incomes, improving village connectivity and accelerating digital adoption, the Survey flagged persistent gaps between intent and execution across states.\n\n“Monitoring in several states revealed gaps, including work not being done on the ground, expenditure not matching physical progress, the use of machines in labour-intensive work, and frequent bypassing of digital attendance systems,” the Survey noted.\n\nThe Survey argued that although MGNREGS expanded participation and improved transparency through digitisation, structural weaknesses in accountability and outcomes remained unresolved. In many instances, spending failed to translate into durable asset creation or productivity gains, while leakages and poor monitoring diluted the programme’s effectiveness as a safety net.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the government has enacted the Viksit Bharat–Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act, 2025, or the VB G-RAM G Act, 2025, marking a statutory overhaul of rural employment policy.\n\nAccording to the Survey, the new framework seeks to align rural employment with the government’s long-term vision of Viksit Bharat 2047, while tightening accountability and focusing more sharply on infrastructure outcomes and income security.\n\nThe VB G-RAM G Act, the Survey said, represents a decisive shift in approach, addressing operational shortcomings of MGNREGS through a more modern, accountable and outcome-oriented framework."

In FY20 the total EV registrations in the country stood at around 0.1-0.2 million.\n\nElectric passenger vehicle registrations crossed the 100,000 mark for the first time in FY25, registering an 18 percent increase compared to the previous year.\n\nElectric two-wheelers continued to dominate the segment, with registrations growing by 21 percent in FY25 to reach 1.15 million units, underlining their role as the primary driver of EV adoption in India.\n\nThe strong growth trajectory has been supported by multiple policy interventions launched by the Centre to promote electric mobility. One of the key initiatives is the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for the Automobile and Auto Components Industry, approved in September 2021 with an outlay of Rs 25,938 crore. The scheme, which incentivises high-value advanced automotive technology vehicles and components, has attracted cumulative investments worth Rs 35,657 crore till September 2025.\n\nAnother major pillar is the PLI scheme for the National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage, with an outlay of Rs 18,100 crore for 50 GWh capacity. Under the scheme, 40 GWh of capacity has already been awarded, helping localise battery manufacturing and strengthen the domestic EV ecosystem.\n\nIn September 2024, the government also launched the PM E-Drive scheme with an outlay of Rs 10,900 crore. The programme provides demand incentives for electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers, while extending support to new segments such as e-trucks and e-ambulances. It also includes funding for charging infrastructure and upgrades of vehicle testing agencies.\n\nFurther boosting public transport electrification, the Centre notified the PM e-Bus Sewa–Payment Security Mechanism (PSM) scheme in October 2024, with an estimated outlay of Rs 3,435.33 crore. The scheme aims to support the deployment of over 38,000 electric buses by providing payment security to operators and OEMs in case of defaults by public transport authorities.\n\nThe Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) had previously said that government policy interventions, combined with a growing number of EV launches by manufacturers, have provided strong momentum for the adoption of electric vehicles across the country."

        "full_content": "The government rolled out Phase II of its Compliance Reduction and Deregulation initiative in January 2026, expanding the scope of reforms across key sectors such as land, building and construction, labour, environment, education, health, utilities and overarching regulatory frameworks, the Economic Survey 2025–26 said.\n\nThe Survey said the initiative reflects a broader reorientation of governance towards strengthening state capacity through the disciplined removal of regulatory frictions. “The Economic Survey brings together these three elements – state capacity, the society, and deregulation – in the pursuit of Viksit Bharat and global influence. A strong and stable currency would be a natural corollary of that,” it said.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the survey in Parliament on January 29.\n\nPhase I outcomes encouraging, Phase II broadens scope\n\nAccording to the Survey, outcomes from the first phase of deregulation have been encouraging. “The experience of Phase I illustrates a broader lesson of this chapter: that state capacity is built not only through new institutions or additional controls, but through disciplined removal of frictions that impede productive activity,” it said.\n\nBuilding on this experience, “Phase II of the Compliance Reduction and Deregulation initiative was rolled out in January 2026 to cover additional priority areas, including land, building and construction, utilities and permissions, environment, education, health, labour, and overarching reforms,” the Survey noted.\n\n“The current phase of deregulation demonstrates how disciplined removal of friction can strengthen state capacity at scale,” it added.\n\nDeregulation as institutional reorientation\n\n“Deregulation, when pursued as a continuous and coordinated governance process, is not a retreat of the State but a strengthening of it,” it said.\n\nBy “simplifying rules, clarifying responsibilities, and making processes predictable and time-bound, administrative effort is shifted away from low-value policing toward problem-solving, monitoring, and execution,” the Survey said, adding that deregulation thus becomes “not only a pro-business reform, but a mechanism for building state capacity itself”.\n\nThe chapter also examined the compliance reduction initiative as a practical demonstration of institutional capability. “Deregulation is treated not as regulatory withdrawal, but as institutional reorientation, shifting administrative effort from low-value policing toward coordination, facilitation, and problem-solving,” it said.\n\nTask Force driving coordinated reform\n\nThe Survey detailed the role of the Task Force on Compliance Reduction and Deregulation, constituted in January 2025 under the chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary T.V. Somanathan. The Task Force was set up “to drive reforms that simplify regulations and streamline procedures across States and Union Territories”.\n\nIts objectives include identifying “redundant, overlapping, or outdated compliances”, guiding States in amending laws and procedures, encouraging standardised reform templates, facilitating risk-based compliance frameworks, promoting digitisation of government-to-business services through a countrywide Single Window System, and documenting best practices for replication.\n\n“What distinguishes this exercise from earlier deregulation drives is not only the number of reforms, but the institutional process: cross-agency coordination, iterative problem-solving with States, and real-time learning,” the Survey said.\n\nPriority areas and state-level momentum\n\nThe Task Force identified 23 Priority Areas across five broad sectors – Land Use, Building and Construction, Labour, Utilities and Permissions, and Overarching Priorities – covering a large share of regulatory interactions between enterprises and the State.\n\nBeyond common templates, “several States and Union Territories have undertaken innovative reforms that go beyond the common reform templates, tailored to their specific administrative, economic, and spatial contexts,” the Survey said. This, it added, demonstrates how deregulation is being internalised as “a continuous governance process rather than a checklist exercise”.\n\nThe Survey linked deregulation with broader economic outcomes. “Sustained state-level deregulation efforts are enabling small and medium enterprises to expand and integrate more effectively into formal value chains, elevating the economy’s medium-term growth potential,” it said.\n\nIndia has also recorded “significant employment growth in recent years, supported by structural reforms, tax rationalisation, and a sustained focus on skill development”. Measures such as deregulation, Goods and Services Tax reforms and labour reforms implemented by states have contributed to rising labour force participation and employment growth across industry and services.\n\nThe Survey noted that FY26 was marked by heightened external uncertainty, including penal tariffs affecting exporters. “The government responded by using this crisis as an opportunity to push through key measures such as GST rationalisation, faster progress on deregulation, and further simplification of compliance requirements across sectors,” it said.\n\nLooking ahead, the Survey said predictable and stable regulatory frameworks would be critical for reviving private capital expenditure. “Reviving private capital expenditure in such areas requires buffering sector-specific uncertainty by enhancing predictability through deregulation and simpler, more stable laws and frameworks,” it said."

        "full_content": "The Economic Survey 2025-26 has proposed a national input cost reduction strategy, saying lowering the cost of energy, logistics, raw materials, compliance and others is as critical to industrial growth as building physical infrastructure.\n\nThe survey framed input costs as a form of “competitiveness infrastructure”, suggesting that elevated costs across supply chains act like a hidden tax on manufacturing, exports and job creation. It argued that for India to emerge as a globally competitive manufacturing hub, competitiveness must be both achievable and affordable across sectors, not limited to a few protected industries.\n\nIt cautioned that traditional industrial strategies centred on protecting final goods can backfire if input costs remain high. According to the survey, protecting downstream products while leaving raw material, energy and logistics costs elevated makes it harder for firms to scale production or compete internationally. Affordable and reliable inputs, it notes, are foundational to sustaining industrial growth and export competitiveness.\n\nThe survey flagged tariff inversion as a key risk. When duties on intermediate goods exceed those on finished products, domestic producers face higher costs than importers of finished goods, it said. This can encourage assembly-led imports instead of deeper domestic value addition, weakening manufacturing depth and reducing incentives for private investment. Correcting such distortions, the survey said, is a structural reform with economy-wide implications rather than a marginal trade policy adjustment.\n\nThe survey emphasised that input cost reform should be rule-based and economy-wide rather than sector-specific. Inputs widely used across industries should not be treated as revenue sources or protection instruments once domestic capacity is established. Protecting such inputs may benefit a narrow set of producers but raises costs for downstream sectors, weakening export competitiveness and job creation.\n\nThe survey also linked input costs directly to private investment behaviour. Thin margins in export-oriented manufacturing, high sensitivity among MSMEs and limited incentives to invest in technology upgrades make input costs a binding constraint on industrial expansion. In this context, lowering input costs can simultaneously strengthen multiple value chains and improve overall industrial productivity.\n\nBy treating input cost efficiency as a core policy priority, alongside infrastructure, logistics and regulatory simplification, the survey signals a shift toward a horizontal industrial strategy aimed at strengthening India’s position in global manufacturing and export markets."

        "full_content": "Global financial markets were unsettled in the first half of calendar year (CY) 2025 following the US government's announcement of a series of tariff measures. The move triggered a sharp rise in global policy uncertainty, prompting investors to cut exposure to the US dollar and rotate towards traditional safe-haven assets, most notably gold.\n\nAccording to the Economic Survey 2026, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on January 29, global equity markets weakened and risk premiums widened across asset classes in April 2025. The spike in uncertainty led to heightened volatility across financial markets. However, conditions stabilised in the months that followed, as some of the US government’s policy announcements were rolled back and market volatility gradually returned to normal levels.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, gold emerged as a clear outperformer. Prices surged from $2,607 per ounce to $4,315 per ounce during 2025, supported by a weakening US dollar, expectations of persistently negative real interest rates, and growing investor concerns around geopolitical and financial tail risks, per the economic survey.\n\nBy contrast, global equities, represented by the MSCI World index (premier stock market index), delivered modest gains. After an early March dip, equities recovered and trended higher, but at a slower pace than gold. The gap between gold and global equities widened notably after September, suggesting investors increasingly favoured defensive assets over growth-linked ones.\n\nEmerging-market equities lagged even further, posting only gradual gains throughout the year.\n\nCorporate bond markets tell a third part of the story. US and euro high-yield spreads spiked sharply around April, signalling stress and risk aversion. However, spreads narrowed steadily afterwards, indicating improving credit conditions and stabilising investor confidence. Even so, this improvement in bonds did not translate into stronger equity performance.\n\nThe economic survey stated, \"Financial markets are typically the first to register and absorb the impact of an uncertainty shock. Much before agents across government, trade, and households adjust their choices, financial market participants tend to respond by pricing in uncertainty risk in real time. The year 2025 was marked by heightened uncertainty, which had a palpable impact on financial markets.\"\n\nThe survey also revealed that the impact of uncertainty on financial markets extends beyond just increased volatility and risk premiums. Research indicates that extended periods of uncertainty can influence the financial sector through at least three main channels. First, financial market participants tend to delay decisions when faced with uncertainty. Second, increased uncertainty can raise borrowing costs by widening credit spreads and financial intermediation expenses. Third, sustained uncertainty may lead to more significant market corrections across various asset classes."

It added that universities should have the freedom to curate and offer courses based on industry requirements and students’ aptitudes.\n\n“Flexibility is the key to building capable talent in India,” the survey said, pointing to the Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhishthan Bill, 2025 as a foundational reform. It said the proposed legislation represents “an essential first step” in giving higher education institutions the autonomy to adapt their curricula in line with rapidly evolving technology trends.\n\n“As the floor for what is considered a fundamental skill shifts with every technological revolution, the passage of the bill will afford our higher education system the freedom to keep pace with the evolving world,” the survey said.\n\nThe document also called for a rethink of how policymakers define formal education and work experience. “Now is the time for policies to reevaluate what constitutes ‘formal education’ and what constitutes ‘work experience’,” it said, noting that the traditional separation between classrooms and industry exposure may no longer work in an AI-driven economy.\n\nIndia already has enabling frameworks in place to support such changes, the survey said.\n\n“With the National Education Policy 2020’s Multiple Entry Multiple Exit provisions, the Academic Bank of Credits, and the National Credit Framework, India has the policy infrastructure in place to make this vision real,” it added."

        "full_content": "Nearly four in ten gig workers in India earn less than Rs 15,000 a month, highlighting income volatility and economic insecurity in the fast-growing platform economy, according to the Economic Survey 2025–26.\n\nThe Survey notes that while gig work has expanded rapidly alongside the growth of digital platforms, smartphones and digital payments, earnings remain uneven and access to credit and social security continues to lag for a large section of workers.\n\nThe findings come even as India’s gig workforce stands at 77 lakh workers, accounting for just over 2 percent of total employment, underlining the sector’s growing footprint but still limited role in the overall labour market.\n\nData cited in the Survey shows that the gig workforce increased from around 77 lakh workers in FY21 to about 1.2 crore by FY25, a rise of nearly 55 percent in four years. Despite this growth, the sector continues to represent a small share of overall employment, reflecting the dominance of traditional jobs across agriculture, manufacturing and services.\n\nLooking ahead, the Survey estimates that non-agricultural gig work could account for 6.7 percent of India’s workforce by 2029–30, contributing as much as Rs 2.35 lakh crore to GDP, as platform-based work expands across delivery, logistics, transportation, IT services and other segments.\n\nSector-wise data shows that gig employment is concentrated in e-commerce and logistics, which together account for 52 lakh workers, with 37 lakh in e-commerce and 15 lakh in logistics. BFSI and manufacturing employ 10 lakh gig workers each, followed by retail at 7 lakh. Transportation and IT account for 6 lakh and 5 lakh workers, respectively.\n\nSmaller segments include healthcare, IT-enabled services, construction and education, with around 3 lakh workers each. Sectors such as automotive (1 lakh), hospitality (0.8 lakh), infrastructure (0.7 lakh), telecom (0.5 lakh) and power and energy (0.3 lakh) together form a relatively limited share of the overall gig workforce.\n\nThe Survey notes that demand for gig labour varies significantly by task type and skill level, ranging from high-turnover delivery and retail roles to specialised professionals such as programmers, physicians and legal consultants working across multiple clients.\n\nDespite the sector's expansion, the Survey flags income volatility as a key concern. Around 40 percent of gig workers earn less than Rs 15,000 per month, reflecting uneven demand, variable payouts and the absence of assured wages.\n\nIrregular earnings and limited employment histories have also resulted in restricted access to formal credit, with many gig workers falling into the “thin-file” category. Limited access to finance constrains their ability to invest in productive assets such as vehicles or specialised equipment, making it difficult to move into higher-paying gigs.\n\nAlgorithms and worker vulnerability\n\nThe Survey highlights the growing role of platform algorithms in determining work allocation, performance monitoring, wages and supply-demand matching. While these systems enable operational efficiency and scale, they also raise concerns around transparency, algorithmic bias and burnout.\n\nIt also notes that limited skilling and concerns over job losses linked to technological advances such as artificial intelligence and machine learning add to worker vulnerability, particularly in low-skilled gig roles.\n\nOn regulation, the Survey reiterates that gig and platform workers have been formally recognised under the Code on Social Security, while remaining outside traditional employer–employee relationships. It highlights the need to expand access to social security measures such as provident fund, insurance and maternity benefits through welfare frameworks and benefit portability.\n\nWhile referencing global regulatory developments such as the European Union’s Platform Workers’ Directive and Spain’s rider law, the Survey does not indicate any move towards employee reclassification in India.\n\nThe Survey states that policy efforts should focus on improving access to skilling, credit and productive assets, with the objective of enabling upward mobility and ensuring that gig work does not remain a low-income necessity. As the gig economy expands further, addressing income insecurity and strengthening worker protections will be key to sustaining its contribution to employment and economic growth."

Nearly half of the issuances (about 47 per cent of total issuances) were concentrated in bonds maturing beyond 10 years. This provided the necessary support for managing rollover risk.\n\nOverall, the weighted average maturity (WAM) of borrowings stood at about 19.14 years in FY26 so far, compared with 20.66 years in FY25. The weighted average coupon (WAC) of fresh issuances during FY26 (as on 19 January 2026) has declined to 6.65 per cent as compared to 7.11 per cent in FY25.\n\nOver the longer term, the weighted average coupon on outstanding debt has fallen from 7.71 per cent in FY20 to 7.25 per cent in FY25."

        "full_content": "India’s push to rapidly expand data centres and AI compute capacity could face significant bottlenecks due to rising costs, infrastructure constraints and global shortages of critical hardware such as GPUs, the Economic Survey released on January 29 said.\n\nThe Survey said that while sufficient compute capacity is essential for training and developing cutting-edge artificial intelligence models, surging global demand for GPUs and limited supply of key components such as high-bandwidth memory chips and storage are pushing up costs. This could make the financial viability of large-scale data centre expansion increasingly challenging for India.\n\n“Even if the sovereign, domestic investors, or financial institutions are willing to finance data centre expansion, plans may need to be put on hold until GPU supplies are secured,” the Survey noted, highlighting that higher demand from international buyers could choke the availability of GPUs for domestic players.\n\nAccording to the Survey, the interaction between financial constraints, infrastructure readiness and external supply dependencies will determine the pace and scale of India’s AI compute expansion.\n\nIt cautioned that simply making financing available may not be sufficient if other bottlenecks such as grid availability or hardware access remain unresolved.\n\nTo analyse these risks, the Survey has proposed an Agent Based Modelling (ABM) framework, allowing financing, electricity grid capacity and access to hardware to interact through feedback loops. The objective is to identify scenarios where “coordination failures” can emerge, even when demand for AI infrastructure remains strong.\n\nThe government clarified that the exercise is a policy stress test rather than a forecasting tool. It does not attempt to estimate optimal compute capacity or exact investment needs. Instead, it seeks to uncover structural vulnerabilities in India’s AI infrastructure ecosystem and identify leverage points where policy interventions could be most effective.\n\nThe Survey also underlined the limits of price-based or subsidy-led approaches in isolation. When financial constraints, power infrastructure gaps and global hardware shortages coincide, subsidies alone may not accelerate capacity creation."

        "full_content": "Amidst stability, credit growth has picked up again in the second half of the year. The Economic Survey tabled in Parliament by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on January 29 said that a key factor driving credit growth is a sharp increase in loans against gold jewellery, which have risen by 125.3 percent (YoY), possibly due to rising prices of the yellow metal.\n\n\"In terms of sectoral deployment of non-food credit, among the categories of agriculture and allied activities, industry, services and personalloans,the highest YoY growth has been observed in personal loans, with an increase of 12.8 per cent in November 2025. A significant factor contributing to this growth is a substantial rise in loans against gold jewellery, which have increased by 125.3 per cent (YoY), likely due to the increasing prices of gold,\" the survey said.\n\nAfter moderating earlier in FY26, lending picked up sharply towards the end of 2025. As of December, bank credit was growing at 14.5 per cent year-on-year. Personal loans have led this growth, especially loans against gold jewellery, which have surged due to rising gold prices.\n\nIndia’s banking system has demonstrated strong signs of stability, supported by healthier balance sheets, low bad loans, and consistent profits. Recent data indicates that scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) are in a much better position than a few years ago, and this improvement boosts overall economic confidence.\n\nOne of the biggest positives is asset quality. The gross non-performing asset (GNPA) ratio and net NPA ratio of SCBs have fallen to multi-decadal lows, indicating that banks are better managing stressed loans. At the same time, banks remain well capitalised. The capital-to-risk-weighted-asset ratio stood at a strong 17.2 percent in September 2025, per the economic survey.\n\nThe survey also revealed that bad loans in industry, services, and personal loans declined over the past six months. Industry GNPA fell to 1.9 percent, services to 1.8 percent, and personal loans to 1.1 percent by September.\n\nAgriculture remains a concern, with a higher GNPA of 6 percent, which improved slightly from 6.1 percent in March 2025.\n\nBanks are also recovering more money from stressed assets. Recovery rates have nearly doubled since FY18, aided by improved resolution mechanisms. \"The recovery rate in NPAs in SCBs has approximately doubled from 13.2 per cent in FY18 to 26.2 per cent in FY25,\" stated the Economic Survey.\n\nThe survey showed that the slippage ratio of SCBs, indicating the growth of NPAs relative to standard loans and advances at the start of the fiscal year, improved from 7.1 percent in FY18 to 1.4 percent in FY25, and declined further to 1.3 percent in the September quarter."

        "full_content": "More and more people are looking to AI for getting budget breakdowns and retirement projections in seconds. It makes you wonder if you still need a human financial advisor at all. After all, an algorithm doesn’t forget details, doesn’t get tired, and doesn’t charge a percentage of your assets.\n\nThe short answer is this: AI can help you build a financial plan, but it still struggles to understand one.\n\nYou can use AI when the problem is structured and data-heavy. Give it your income, expenses, assets, liabilities, expected returns and time horizons, and it can generate scenarios almost instantly. It can model retirement cash flows, test different withdrawal rates, suggest asset allocations, and show how small changes today might affect outcomes decades later.\n\nFor people who like clarity and structure, this is powerful. AI tools are also great for education. They explain concepts, flag obvious gaps, and help you think through “what if” situations without judgement.\n\nUsed well, AI can make financial planning far more accessible and less intimidating.\n\nBut financial planning is not a maths exam. It sits at the intersection of money, behaviour, fear, family and uncertainty.\n\nAI doesn’t really know what it means when someone says, “I want to feel secure,” or “I’m scared of becoming a burden,” or “I don’t trust markets after what I lived through.” It can respond with words, but it doesn’t read between the lines.\n\nA human advisor notices hesitation, contradictions, and emotional blind spots. They recognise when a client says they want high returns but panics at a 10 percent fall. Or when someone insists on retiring early without fully acknowledging health risks or family responsibilities.\n\nThose gaps are often where financial plans fail.\n\nBehaviour matters more than optimisation\n\nMany people don’t run out of money because their plan was mathematically flawed. They run out because they abandoned it at the wrong time.\n\nThey stop investing during market crashes. They overspend when things feel comfortable. They delay uncomfortable decisions like insurance, wills, or reducing lifestyle costs.\n\nAI can recommend the “right” action. It cannot sit across from you and talk you out of a bad one when emotions take over.\n\nA good human advisor often adds value not by maximising returns, but by preventing costly mistakes.\n\nLife doesn’t stay inside templates\n\nAI works best with stable assumptions. Real life rarely cooperates.\n\nCareers change. Health issues appear. Parents age. Children take unexpected paths. Marriages evolve. Some plans need to be redrawn not because the numbers changed, but because priorities did.\n\nA human advisor adapts the plan around life. AI adapts life to the plan. That difference matters.\n\nThink of AI as a very capable co-pilot. It’s excellent for drafting a first version of a plan, stress-testing ideas, comparing options, and staying organised. It can help you prepare better questions, understand trade-offs, and keep track of your progress.\n\nFor people who are financially aware, disciplined, and comfortable making decisions, AI may be enough for large parts of the journey.\n\nBut when decisions involve trade-offs between security and freedom, between family needs and personal goals, or between fear and opportunity, human judgement still plays a critical role.\n\nThe choice isn’t AI or a human advisor. It’s how the two work together. AI reduces costs, improves clarity and democratizes access to planning tools. Human advisors bring context, empathy, accountability and experience.\n\nUsed together, they can produce better outcomes than either could alone."

One-time registration for insurance intermediaries, relaxation of IRDAI approval norms for equity transfers, and the reduction in Net Owned Funds requirements for foreign reinsurers, from Rs 5,000 crore to Rs 1,000 crore, are expected to facilitate market entry, improve risk absorption capacity, and strengthen reinsurance depth in the domestic market.\n\nBeyond capital formation, the Act strengthens consumer trust and market integrity.\n\nThe creation of a Policyholders’ Education and Protection Fund aims to improve insurance awareness and financial literacy, while enhanced regulatory powers for the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), including the authority to disgorge wrongful gains and impose higher penalties, are designed to strengthen compliance and governance standards across insurers and intermediaries.\n\nThe alignment of insurance regulations with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 further integrates the sector with India’s digital public infrastructure, enabling scale while safeguarding policyholder data."

        "full_content": "India operates just about 0.11 airports per million people, far below the United States’ 47.35 and China’s 0.39, underlining the vast untapped potential for expansion in the country’s civil aviation sector, the Economic Survey 2025–26 tabled by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman January 29 said.\n\nDespite the relatively sparse airport density, India has emerged as the world’s third-largest domestic aviation market, after the US and China. The Survey highlighted that the number of operational airports in the country has more than doubled to 164 in 2025 from 74 in 2014, reflecting a decade of rapid infrastructure creation and policy-led expansion.\n\nFurther capacity is in the pipeline. The government has granted in-principle approval for 24 greenfield airports, of which 13 are already operational, including the much-anticipated Navi Mumbai International Airport. These additions are expected to significantly ease congestion at metro hubs while strengthening regional and urban connectivity.\n\n“India’s civil aviation sector is on a sustained growth trajectory, supported by a conducive policy environment, rising demand and steady infrastructure expansion,” the Survey said. It noted, however, that the sector remains sensitive to global economic cycles and requires continuous capacity upgrades. Even so, current passenger volumes represent only a fraction of the country’s long-term potential.\n\nSince FY20, modernisation projects at airports across the country have increased the combined passenger-handling capacity of operational airports to around 575 million passengers per annum. In FY25, Indian airports handled 412 million passengers, marking a 10 percent increase over 374 million passengers in FY24.\n\nGovernment projections state that annual passenger traffic could rise to 665 million by FY31, driven by rising incomes, improved regional connectivity and continued urbanisation.\n\nA key driver of this growth has been the government’s regional connectivity push. As of FY25, 657 routes connecting 93 airports, including heliports and water aerodromes, have been operationalised, improving access to remote and aspirational regions while keeping air travel affordable.\n\nBuilding on this, the Survey noted that a modified UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) scheme has been announced. The revamped programme aims to connect 120 new destinations and enable air travel for 4 crore passengers over the next decade.\n\nThe Survey also pointed to steady progress in the air cargo segment. Air cargo volumes increased from 2.53 million metric tonnes (MMT) in FY15 to 3.72 MMT in FY25, while 2.95 MMT was handled in FY26 up to December. Growth has been supported by policy reforms, infrastructure upgrades and improved logistics integration.\n\nHowever, after registering a robust 10.5 percent growth in FY25, air cargo expansion moderated to about 5 percent during April–November 2025. According to industry assessments cited in the Survey, the slowdown reflects a mix of factors, including higher operating costs, capacity constraints, geopolitical uncertainties affecting international routes, and a normalisation of demand following strong growth in the previous year.\n\nBeyond airports and airlines, the Survey underscored the importance of a growing ancillary ecosystem. Expansion in airport and air navigation infrastructure, along with the development of Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facilities and aircraft leasing capabilities, is strengthening India’s aviation value chain.\n\n“These developments, coupled with deeper technology integration, position civil aviation as a key driver of nationwide economic connectivity and integration,” the Survey said.\n\nTaken together, the data suggests that while India has made significant strides in expanding its aviation footprint over the past decade, the low airport-to-population ratio leaves ample headroom for long-term growth, reinforcing aviation’s role as a critical enabler of economic development."

        "full_content": "India’s insurance sector's biggest change is simple but structural: reducing high distribution and acquisition costs, according to Economic Survey 2026.\n\nUnless these cost inefficiencies are dismantled, insurance will remain expensive for customers and limited in reach, despite the sector’s strong balance sheets and financial stability, the report says.\n\nFor years, the industry has operated in what can be called a “low-penetration, high-cost” model.\n\nInsurance companies are financially strong and well-capitalised, but the cost of selling insurance is too high, the report flags. Expensive distribution channels, heavy commissions, and inefficient acquisition models have pushed up the price of protection. This has made insurance less affordable for large sections of the population, keeping penetration low even as the industry grows in size.\n\nIn the life insurance segment, private insurers are showing healthy topline growth, but profits are not growing at the same pace. Rising acquisition expenses are eating into margins, leaving net profits largely flat.\n\nSimply put, insurers are selling more policies, but earning proportionally less from them because it costs too much to acquire each customer.\n\nThe non-life insurance sector faces a similar challenge, according to the report.\n\nHigh combined ratios mean that underwriting operations are not generating enough profits on their own. To stay profitable, insurers are increasingly relying on investment income to support their core business. This strategy is risky, as it makes profitability dependent on capital market performance rather than on the strength of insurance operations themselves.\n\nThe solution lies in rationalising acquisition and distribution costs, the report suggests.\n\nDigitising distribution, through direct platforms, embedded insurance, partnerships with fintechs and platforms, and technology-led sales models, can significantly reduce the cost of reaching customers. Lower costs would allow insurers to price products more accurately, offer better value to policyholders, and make insurance more affordable."

        "full_content": "If you own shares or equity mutual funds and need cash urgently, a loan against shares (LAS) can help. Taking a loan against your shares means you won’t have to sell your investments, avoid a capital gains tax at that moment, and the interest rate is often lower than an unsecured personal loan.\n\nBut LAS is not “easy money”. It is a secured loan tied tightly to market movements, and that changes the risk equation in ways many borrowers underestimate.\n\nWhat exactly is a loan against shares?\n\nWhen taking a loan against shares you can borrow money by pledging your listed shares or equity mutual fund units as collateral. The shares remain in your name, and you continue to get dividends or corporate benefits, but the lender has the right to sell them if you are unable to pay off the loan.\n\nTheseloansare offered by banks, NBFCs and brokers through a pledge mechanism linked to your DEMAT account. The loan amount is usually a percentage of the market value of the pledged securities, known as the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio.\n\nFor most equity shares, the LTV is around 40-50 percent. For equity mutual funds, it can go up to 50-60 percent, depending on the fund and the lender.\n\nHow the money is disbursed and repaid\n\nOnce your shares are pledged, the loan is either disbursed as a lump sum or set up as an overdraft facility. Interest is charged only on the amount you use, not on the full sanctioned limit.\n\nThis flexibility makes LAS attractive for short-term needs like business cash flow gaps, bridge financing, or covering an unexpected expense without disturbing long-term investments.\n\nRepayment terms vary. Some lenders expect periodic interest payments with the principal repaid at the end, while others allow partial repayments anytime.\n\nThe real risk: Market movements\n\nThis is where loans against shares differ sharply from most other loans.\n\nIf the market falls and the value of your pledged shares drops, your LTV shoots up automatically. When it crosses the lender’s comfort level, you get a margin call. That means you must either add more shares, bring in cash, or repay part of the loan.\n\nIf you don’t act quickly, the lender has the right to sell your shares to recover the loan, often at precisely the wrong time from an investor’s perspective.\n\nThis forced selling risk is the single biggest drawback of LAS.\n\nCosts you should look beyond interest rates\n\nInterest rates on LAS are usually lower than personal loans, but they are not the only cost. There may be pledge charges, renewal fees, and penal interest if margins are breached.\n\nAlso, because the loan is linked to volatile assets, the “mental cost” of constantly tracking markets is real. A sharp correction can turn a calm borrowing decision into a stressful one overnight.\n\nWhen a loan against shares makes sense\n\nLAS works best when the borrowing need is short-term and predictable, and when the pledged portfolio is diversified and not excessively volatile.\n\nIt can also make sense if selling your shares would trigger a large capital gains tax or disrupt a long-term investment plan, and you are confident you can repay or reduce the loan quickly.\n\nBusiness owners and self-employed professionals often use LAS as a temporary liquidity tool rather than a long-term borrowing solution.\n\nIf your income is uncertain, your shares are concentrated in a few stocks, or you are already uncomfortable with market volatility, LAS can amplify stress.\n\nIt is also a poor choice for long-term consumption spending. Using volatile assets to fund lifestyle expenses over many years increases the risk of forced liquidation.\n\nIf you cannot meet a margin call without selling the same shares you pledged, the structure is already too risky.\n\nA loan against shares is not inherently good or bad. It is a sharp financial tool that works well in specific situations and cuts badly in others.\n\nUsed thoughtfully, it can provide low-cost liquidity without derailing your investment journey. Used casually, it can push you into selling quality assets at the worst possible time.\n\nBefore taking one, ask yourself not just whether the interest rate is attractive, but whether you are prepared for what happens if markets move against you."

        "full_content": "Wondering if you can save on capital gains if you invest ancestral house sale proceeds in bonds and property? Today’s Ask Wallet Wise explains how the exemption works under sections 54 and 54EC.\n\nMy grandmother purchased a residential house property in 1956. It was bequeathed to me and I have mutated it in my name in 2024. If I sell it now, can I invest the entire proceeds in bonds and property to save capital gains?\n\nExpert’s Advice: Though there is no cost of assets received as a gift from specified relatives or as inheritance, either under a will or under personal law, the cost for the purpose of computing the capital gain is taken to be the cost for which the same was purchased by the last owner who had paid for it.\n\nFor capital assets acquired before April 1, 2001, the fair market value on that date can be taken as the cost for the computation of capital gains. As the house acquired in 1956 was received by you as an inheritance, you can opt to take the fair market value on April 1, 2001, as your cost for computing the capital gains. Likewise, the holding period for determining whether the capital asset has become a long-term asset or not is also counted from the date on which the same was acquired by the last owner who had paid for it.\n\nSince the holding period of the residential house is more than two years, the difference between the sale price and the fair market value (as discussed above) will be taxed as long-term capital gains in your hands. To save tax on such long-term capital gains, you have two options, which can be used singularly or in combination. Please note that under both options, you have to invest only the long-term capital gains and not the entire sale proceeds.\n\nThe first option is available under Section 54, where you invest the unindexed long-term capital gains for the purchase or construction of another residential house in India within the prescribed time period.\n\nFor buying a ready-to-move-in house, the investment has to be made within two years from the date of sale of the existing house. Even if you buy a residential house within a year before the date of sale of the existing residential house, exemption under Section 54 can be claimed.  For self-construction or booking an under-construction house, a longer period of three years is available from the date of sale of the house, within which the construction of the house needs to be completed and possession obtained.\n\nThe amount which is not utilised for the purchase or construction of the house by the due date of filing your income tax return is required to be deposited in a bank account under the Capital Gains Account Scheme. The deposited money has to be used within the time prescribed for the purpose of buying or constructing the residential house.\n\nThe second option is under Section 54EC. You have to invest the long-term capital gains in Capital Gain Bonds of a specified financial institution within six months from the date of sale of the existing house.  A maximum of Rs 50 lakhs can be invested in these bonds in one financial year, as well as for claiming exemption in respect of a single year."

The broader crypto market slipped after the US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at 3.5 percent–3.75 percent, wiping $2.9 trillion off the market.\n\n\"The drop was led by bitcoin’s falling below $88,000 amid low liquidity and cautious sentiment. The cryptocurrency, however, stayed rangebound between $86,000–$91,000, with open interest concentrated near $90,000 ahead of Friday’s options expiry. For now, crypto markets appear locked in consolidation-active, but waiting for a decisive macro or technical catalyst,\" said Riya Sehgal, Research Analyst, Delta Exchange.\n\nCoinSwitch Markets desk said, \"From a technical perspective, $90K remains key resistance, with a sustained break required to unlock upside toward $91K–$92K, while $89K continues to act as strong near-term support, where buyers have repeatedly stepped in.\"\n\nEthereum was down 1.95 percent, Tehter 0.03 percent, XRP 1.67 percent, Solana 3.16 percent, Dogecoin 2.20 percent, and Cardano 2.04 percent.

Gold continues to mark new highs, which has negatively impacted the crypto markets as the liquidity appears to have rotated into traditional assets,\" said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\nAccording to Avinash Shekhar, Co-Founder & CEO, Pi42, bitcoin’s inability to sustain a move above $90,000 is more indicative of short-term hesitation than structural weakness. \"The fact that bitcoin is hovering near key technical zones with clearly defined liquidation thresholds shows that participants are positioning carefully around upcoming catalysts rather than exiting aggressively,\" he said.\n\n\"Derivatives data suggest positioning has tightened, keeping volatility contained for now. As macro clarity improves and liquidity conditions normalise,\" Shekhar said. Bitcoin’s ability to defend the range should support the next leg of the move toward higher levels, including the $95,000.\n\nWhat’s happening in the crypto market?\n\nHere’s a rundown of the crypto market according to WazirX founder Nischal Shetty and CoinDCX research team:"

        "full_content": "Harmonising the rules under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act has emerged as a significant issue for rural housing finance ahead of Budget 2026.\n\nLenders say inconsistent enforcement across states slows loan recovery, raises risks and makes banks hesitant to lend in villages and small towns. For borrowers, this often results in fewer options, higher interest rates and long delays in approving homeloans.\n\n“We recommend budgetary measures for more credit supply to the rural and lower middle-income segments in India. To achieve this, the Union Budget 2026 can include measures for liberalising branch-opening norms for gold loan NBFCs to accelerate outreach and deepen market penetration, especially for secured gold loans which carry relatively lower risk,” Muthoot FinCorp Ltd CEO Shaji Varghese said.\n\nRationalising capital risk weights for gold loans by NBFCs can lower lending costs and promote increased credit flow to rural and semi-urban markets.\n\nHarmonising SARFAESI Act applicability for NBFCs in line with banks and housing finance companies (HFCs) will help drive rural housing credit and strengthen recovery mechanisms for smaller-ticket mortgage loans, Varghese said.\n\nIt should also offer targeted schemes to ensure customers who experienced temporary or one-time credit default are not permanently excluded from formal banking channels . The Budget should also promote formalisation of gold lending by encouraging policy reforms that shift activity from informal channels to regulated institutions and strengthen consumer protection, he said.\n\nThe SARFAESI Act authorises banks and financial institutions to recover non-performing assets (NPAs) without the intervention of courts. It enables lenders to seize, manage and auction secured properties, residential and commercial, to recover loans if a borrower defaults, typically after a 60-day notice period.\n\n\"The Union Budget 2026 can play a meaningful role by deepening domestic liquidity and strengthening risk-sharing frameworks such as credit guarantees and co-lending structures. These measures can help lower borrowing costs, support longer and more predictable tenures, and create repayment structures that offer greater certainty to borrowers,\" Godrej Capital MD & CEO Manish Shah said.\n\nEncouraging stable long-term savings and recognising high levels of tax compliance can further strengthen the funding base of the financial system and reinforce trust in formal participation. \"The objective is not just to build a larger financial ecosystem, but a more resilient and efficient one, where capital flows productively, risk is shared responsibly and finance supports India’s next phase of inclusive and sustainable growth,” Shah said.\n\nAs the government looks for ways to promote affordable housing and increase formal credit in rural areas, experts say clearer and standardised SARFAESI rules can enable lending opportunities. A more predictable recovery process will encourage banks to explore deeper into the countryside, where housing demand is growing but access to finance remains limited, they say."

        "full_content": "Silver has stolen the spotlight in the commodities world, driven by strong industrial demand, global economic uncertainty and surging prices.\n\nLike gold, silver is increasingly seen not just as a hedge against inflation and currency volatility but as a strategic asset class in diversified portfolios. Data from Ace MF shows Indian silver exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reported spectacular gains with one-year returns of more than 270  percent and three-year gains near 70 percent across most funds underscoring bullion’s powerful move.\n\nThe silver ETF ecosystem has grown rapidly, attracting inflows as investors seek regulated, liquid exposure to rising prices without the hassles of owning physical metal. A wide array of ETFs now lets you participate in silver’s upside via your demat account with transparency and cost efficiency.\n\nTop silver ETFs by performance and size\n\nAccording to the latest AUM and performance data, Nippon India Silver ETF leads the pack with assets of nearly Rs 28,944-crore and a one-year return of 272 percent . ICICI Prudential Silver ETF follows with Rs 14,828-crore AUM and a 274 percent gain over one year.\n\nOther large funds such as HDFC Silver ETF, SBI Silver ETF and Kotak Silver ETF also delivered robust results, with one-year returns clustering around the 270-plus mark. Notably, Tata Silver ETF reported the highest year-to-date absolute performance at 708 percent , reflecting heightened momentum in silver prices. Lesser-sized offerings from DSP, Axis and UTI also posted similar stellar gains, illustrating how silver’s rally has lifted nearly the entire ETF category.\n\nWhy silver ETFs are gaining traction\n\nSilver’s dual identity as both a precious and industrial metal has boosted its appeal. Strong demand from solar panel manufacturing, electronics and other tech sectors, coupled with safe-haven buying during uncertain times, has underpinned prices.\n\nUnlike physical silver, ETFs eliminate concerns about storage, purity and safety, and can be traded like stocks on exchanges. This ease of access has helped propel total AUM in combined gold and silver ETFs beyond ₹1 lakh crore, establishing them as mainstream investment vehicles.\n\nAccording to market watchers, the expanding investor base for precious metal ETFs signals a shift toward passive, regulated instruments that offer transparency along with bullion exposure.\n\nSilver ETF Taxation: What investors should know\n\nTaxation can materially affect net returns from silver ETFs. In India, silver ETFs are treated as listed securities for tax purposes. If held for more than 12 months, gains qualify as long-term capital gains and are taxed at a flat 12.5 percent on the amount exceeding the basic exemption, without indexation benefits. Selling within 12 months triggers short-term capital gains, which are taxed at the investor’s slab rate.\n\nFor comparison, physical silver typically attracts long-term capital gains tax at 20 percent with indexation if held for over three years, though digital silver and ETFs streamline holding periods and tax treatment.\n\nSilver ETFs have been standout performers, reflecting strong price action and investor enthusiasm in 2025–26. They offer a cost-efficient, liquid way to access silver’s upside without physical handling. However, like all commodity-linked assets, they can be volatile and are best used as part of a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk appetite and investment horizon. The commodity exposure should be 10-15 percent of your portfolio."

With risks to both inflation and employment having diminished and expectations in line, Powell said ‘’rate hikes are not anyone’s base case’’. Further cuts would be warranted if the labour market weakens, if labour risks re-emerge, or if tariff-related price pressures fade. He also warned that the US budget deficit is unsustainable, underscoring longer-term fiscal risks that complicate the policy backdrop.\n\n\"Globally, this dynamic can loosen financial conditions outside the US, supporting emerging market assets and commodities, while keeping risk sentiment fragile. Equities may grind higher, but with higher cross-asset volatility as markets adjust to a Fed that is increasingly sensitive to downside risks,\" Maxwell said.\n\nOutlook: Will gold continue its momentum?\n\n\"Gold traded strongly positive with gains... on MCX.  Ongoing tariff uncertainty from the US and continued allocation into safe-haven assets have further supported the rally. However, after such a sharp and extended upmove, gold is entering an overheated zone where volatility can increase,\" said Jateen Trivedi, VP research analyst, commodity and currency, LKP Securities.\n\nThe US central bank kept the policy rate unchanged after Fed policymakers voted 10-2 to hold the central bank's benchmark interest rate in the 3.50-3.75 percent range. The US unemployment rate in December stood at 4.4 percent. The yield on the 10-year Treasury is up at 4.25 percent, and the two-year Treasury yield is at around 3.57 percent.\n\nGold also surged amid ongoing tension between the US and Iran and the crises in Ukraine and Gaza. US President Donald Trump's 100 percent tariff threat against Canada if it strikes a trade deal with China and warning of a 25 levy against South Korea have intensified the safe-haven demand in bullion."

        "full_content": "India will immediately slash duties on high-end European cars to 30% from as high as 110% under its new trade deal with the EU, an official said, opening the tightly controlled market to luxury carmakers like BMW and Mercedes-Benz.\n\nIndia and the European Union finalised a long-delayed deal on Tuesday that will cut tariffs on most goods and boost trade, at a time when governments worldwide are seeking to hedge against fickle U.S. policy and manage growing trade tensions.\n\nIndia is the third-largest car market globally by sales after the United States and China. But its domestic auto industry has been among the world's most protected, with the government levying tariffs of between 70% and 110% on imported cars.\n\nPRICIEST EUROPEAN CARS BENEFIT FROM BIGGEST DUTY CUTS\n\nWhile India agreed under the deal to reduce import tariffs on cars above an import price of 15,000 euros ($17,963) to 10% over time, details of how the reductions will be implemented were not disclosed publicly.\n\nA senior Indian government official, however, said New Delhi agreed to immediately reduce import duties on 100,000 traditional internal combustion engine cars annually split between three price categories.\n\nEuropean cars with an import price of 15,000 euros to 35,000 euros will see tariffs reduced to 35%, with annual imports capped at 34,000 units, said the official, who asked not to be named as the deal still requires legal vetting.\n\nCars priced 35,000 euros to 50,000 euros will be charged a 30% duty, with imports limited to 33,000 units a year, the official said. And 33,000 cars priced over 50,000 euros will also be subject to a reduced tariff of 30%.\n\nThe two highest price categories will see the largest tariff reductions. And the cap for all three categories combined will be raised to 160,000 units over 10 years, the official said.\n\nIndia's trade ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the details of the agreement.\n\nMORE INDIANS DEVELOPING A TASTE FOR LUXURY\n\nAt a time when a growing number of Indians are developing a taste for opulence - from expensive homes to watches and even bathroom fittings - luxury cars made up less than 1% of the 4.4 million passenger vehicles sold in the country last year.\n\nWhile executives have said that lower tariffs are unlikely to translate into immediate price cuts, they said the reductions will allow them to bring more vehicles to the market.\n\nLower import taxes should also be a boost for other European automakers such as Volkswagen, Renault and Stellantis, which have said increased trade will also result in increased technology transfer and shared supply chains.\n\nLOCAL EV MANUFACTURERS TO REMAIN PROTECTED FOR NOW\n\nIndia will, meanwhile, also cut import duties to 30% to 35% on a total of 20,000 European-made electric vehicles, the official said, but only five years after the trade deal is implemented.\n\nThose tariff cuts will only apply to EVs priced above 20,000 euros in order to protect domestic players like Tata Motors and Mahindra.\n\nSimilar to combustion engines, the duty on EVs will reduce to 10% over five years and the annual import quota will rise to 90,000 units, the official added."

        "full_content": "It’s one of the most common UPI mistakes, and one of the most stressful. You make a payment, see the success message, and only then realise the money has gone to the wrong UPI ID. The amount may not even be large, but the fear is immediate because UPI moves fast and gives you no obvious way to pull money back.\n\nWhat happens next is far less dramatic than people assume, and often far less reassuring.\n\nWhy a successful UPI payment is hard to undo\n\nUPI transfers are built to be instant and final. Once a transaction shows as successful, the money has already moved from your bank account into someone else’s. Unlike card payments or failed bank transfers, there is no cooling-off window and no automatic reversal. This is the part many users find hard to accept. Even though the payment was a mistake, the bank cannot simply take the money back. Legally and technically, it now sits in the recipient’s account, and any reversal depends on their consent. That design choice is deliberate. UPI prioritises speed and certainty over reversibility. The trade-off is that the responsibility to verify details sits squarely with the sender.\n\nWhat the bank and the app actually do\n\nThe first thing you should do is raise a complaint within the UPI app you used. Every transaction has a dispute or “wrong transfer” option. This doesn’t reverse the money, but it creates a formal trail and triggers communication between banks. Your bank then reaches out to the recipient’s bank, which in turn informs the account holder that money has been credited by mistake and asks whether they are willing to return it. If the recipient agrees, the reversal is processed and the money usually comes back within a few working days.\n\nIf the recipient ignores the request or refuses, the bank’s role becomes limited. Banks cannot\n\ndebit an account without authorisation, even when the credit was accidental. At this point, you may be advised to submit a written complaint or, in some cases, approach the police. That step can help establish pressure, but it does not guarantee recovery.\n\nWhen the money comes back automatically\n\nThere is one situation where users often get lucky. If the UPI ID you entered does not exist at all, the transaction usually fails and the money is automatically returned to your account within a short time. This is why checking whether the transaction was marked “successful” or “failed” matters so much.\n\nOnce it’s successful, however, the outcome depends entirely on the person at the other end.\n\nWhy speed helps, but doesn’t solve everything\n\nRaising a complaint quickly is still important. It increases the chance of contacting the recipient before the money is spent and signals that the transfer was genuinely accidental. But speed does not change the underlying rule. There is no deadline within which banks can force a reversal.\n\nThis is also why UPI fraud cases are harder to resolve than people expect. If money is sent voluntarily, even under deception, recovery is not automatic. Accounts can be flagged or frozen if fraud is proven, but that does not always translate into money coming back.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth about UPI mistakes\n\nThe reason wrong UPI transfers feel so harsh is because the system works so well when things go right. Instant payments leave very little room for human error. The brief moment when the recipient’s name flashes on the screen before you hit confirm is not a formality. It is the only real safeguard you have.\n\nUPI assumes attentiveness, not forgiveness. Once you understand that, the rules make more sense, even if they feel unforgiving.\n\nCan my bank reverse a wrong UPI transfer on its own?\n\nNo. If the transaction is successful, the bank cannot debit the recipient’s account without\n\ntheir consent or a legal order.\n\nHow long does it take to get the money back if the recipient agrees?\n\nUsually a few working days, depending on the banks involved and how quickly the recipient\n\nWhat if the recipient refuses to return the money?\n\nYou can escalate the complaint and, if advised, approach the police, but recovery is not"

        "full_content": "Many parents notice that the Aadhaar card issued to small children looks different. It is blue, not white. This is the Blue Aadhaar card, issued to children below the age of five, and it follows a slightly different set of rules.\n\nThe biggest difference is that children under five do not have to give biometric details. No fingerprints or iris scans are taken. Instead, the Aadhaar number is linked to the Aadhaar of one parent or legal guardian. The idea is simple. Biometric details in young children change quickly, and capturing them too early creates problems later.\n\nThe Blue Aadhaar card contains the child’s name, date of birth, gender and Aadhaar number. A photograph of the child is taken at the time of enrolment. The card also carries a reference to the Aadhaar number of the parent who is linked to the child’s record.\n\nParents can apply for a Blue Aadhaar by taking the child to an authorised Aadhaar enrolment centre. One parent must already have Aadhaar. The process is largely the same as adult enrolment, except that biometric details are skipped. The child’s details are entered, the photograph is taken, and the parent’s Aadhaar is used for verification. Once this is done, an Aadhaar number is generated for the child.\n\nThe Aadhaar number issued at this stage is permanent. It does not change as the child grows older. What changes is the information linked to it.\n\nWhen the child turns five, biometric details have to be updated. This includes fingerprints, iris scans and a fresh photograph. The update must be completed before the child turns seven. If this step is missed, Aadhaar-based authentication may stop working until the update is done. This can create problems when Aadhaar is required for school admissions or other official processes.\n\nThere is another mandatory biometric update when the child turns 15. This update is meant to account for physical changes during adolescence. At both stages, the Aadhaar number remains the same. Only the biometric records are updated.\n\nAadhaar is not legally compulsory for children. However, it is increasingly asked for in everyday situations. Schools often ask for it at the time of admission. It is also used for government health schemes, scholarships and bank-related services. Because of this, many parents choose to enrol their children early to avoid complications later.\n\nThe Blue Aadhaar card itself does not expire and does not need to be replaced. Once biometric updates are completed, it automatically functions like a regular Aadhaar card. Parents mainly need to remember the two update stages, at five and at 15.\n\n1. Is the Blue Aadhaar a different kind of Aadhaar?\n\nNo. It is the same Aadhaar system, issued without biometric details for children under five.\n\n2. What happens if biometric details are not updated after age five?\n\nAadhaar authentication may not work until the biometric update is completed.\n\n3. Can Aadhaar be issued soon after birth?\n\nYes. Aadhaar can be issued to newborns as long as one parent has a valid Aadhaar number."

        "full_content": "Vodafone Ideais not looking at fresh equity infusion at this stage and believes its current funding roadmap, backed by bank loans, promoter support and adjusted gross revenue (AGR) relief, is sufficient to execute its three-year turnaround plan, CEO Abhijit Kishore said, even as the company awaits the outcome of a reassessment of its Rs 87,695 crore AGR dues.\n\nResponding to investor queries, Kishore said the telecom operator is targeting Rs 25,000 crore in bank funding and Rs 10,000 crore in non-funded facilities to support its planned Rs 45,000 crore capital expenditure over the next three years.\n\nWith annual EBITDA of around Rs 9,200 crore, the company’s debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at roughly 2.5x — a level, he said, is manageable for an infrastructure-heavy business.\n\n“We are not looking at equity at this point in time,” Kishore said. “Two years later, we will evaluate how the situation evolves. But today, we believe we have adequate funding through the instruments we have outlined.” He added that both promoters remain committed and engaged in the business.\n\nSpeculation about a potential equity raise or induction of a strategic investor has persisted given Vi’s leverage and upcoming liabilities. However, management indicated that internal cash flow improvement, operational efficiencies and incremental debt will support both network investments and statutory obligations.\n\nA key factor underpinning that confidence is the AGR relief framework under which the company’s dues have been frozen at Rs 87,695 crore as of December 31, 2025, with a staggered, back-ended repayment schedule over 10 years.\n\nAt the same time, a reassessment of AGR dues for the period FY07 to FY19 is underway. “The reassessment has started and is progressing at a very encouraging pace,” Kishore said, declining to provide a timeline or indicate the potential quantum of relief. “We have all the supporting documents and are deeply engaged at multiple levels.”\n\nChief Financial Officer Tejas Mehta said about Rs 80,000 crore of AGR dues are already recognised on the balance sheet, with the balance disclosed as contingent liability in line with the frozen amount. He termed it premature to estimate the outcome of the reassessment.\n\nOn spectrum liabilities, the company made clear it is not seeking any moratorium or deferment from the government. Over the next three years, Vi faces spectrum payment obligations of about Rs 49,000 crore — approximately Rs 7,000 crore in the first year, Rs 15,000 crore in the second and around Rs 27,000 crore in the third.\n\n“We are not seeking any moratorium on spectrum liabilities. That is already built into our cash flow planning,” Kishore said. “Over the next three years, we have spectrum dues of around Rs 49,000 crore, and we are comfortable servicing them.”\n\nManagement said spectrum payments will be met through a combination of improving EBITDA, internal cash generation and planned bank funding. The company has set a target of tripling EBITDA over three years, driven by subscriber stabilisation, customer upgrades and capex-led revenue expansion.\n\n“With EBITDA expansion, operational efficiencies and bank funding, we believe we are in a comfortable position to service both spectrum payments and capex,” Kishore said. “Spectrum payments are part of our committed financial roadmap.”\n\nThe Rs 45,000 crore capex programme — in addition to around Rs 18,000 crore already invested over the past six quarters — will be front-loaded, with higher spending in the first two years to accelerate network rollout and returns. Roughly 70% of the outlay will be directed toward radio access, with the remainder allocated to transport and core network infrastructure."

Chief Executive Officer Akshay Kumar Singh said at the India Energy Week conference in Goa on Wednesday.\n\nAsian benchmark prices are currently above $11 per million Btu, and have been in the double digit range for much of the last five years.\n\nIndia is potentially a massive market for LNG, but buyers there are price-sensitive and will opt for alternatives like coal or diesel if gas isn’t cheap enough. The country has the capacity to import nearly 53 million tons per year, but around half of that is unused due to a lack of affordable supplies and an underdeveloped pipeline network.\n\nIndia will need 100 million tons of LNG import capacity to meet the government’s goal of boosting the share of gas in energy mix to 15% by 2030, from 6% now, Singh said. However, the country’s purchases are only likely to be around 29 millions tons this year, he said."

        "full_content": "Vodafone Idea’s prolonged AGR burden had pushed the telco into a “vicious cycle” of funding constraints, underinvestment and customer losses — but the worst is now behind it, CEO Abhijit Kishore said, unveiling what he called a three-year reset plan aimed at restoring growth and profitability.\n\nFor years, the uncertainty around adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues kept lenders wary, limiting capital access and slowing network expansion. “The AGR overhang meant funding was not available. Without funding, investments and deployments suffered. That hurt network experience, impacted brand perception and led to subscriber losses,” Kishore said during the analyst and investor meeting on January 28. “That has been the cycle we were stuck in.”\n\nThe cycle, he argued, has now been broken by three developments. The first was Vi’s Rs 3,300 crore fundraise through non-convertible debentures (NCDs), secured even before AGR clarity emerged.\n\nThe second was the extension of the contingent liability adjustment mechanism (CLAM) with promoter Vodafone Plc. Originally capped at Rs 8,400 crore for seven years post-merger and expiring in June 2025, the agreement has now been extended until December 31, 2025. Of the remaining Rs 6,400 crore, Rs 2,300 crore will be infused in cash over the next 12 months, while shares worth Rs 328 crore have been earmarked for monetisation.\n\nThe third — and most critical — trigger is the AGR relief framework. Vi’s dues have been frozen at Rs 87,695 crore as of December 31, 2025, with a staggered and back-ended repayment schedule over 10 years. Annual payments will be capped at Rs 124 crore for the first four years, followed by Rs 100 crore annually for the next four, with the reassessed balance payable in six equal instalments between FY36 and FY41.\n\n“This is a definitive, long-term solution with clear visibility on cash flows,” Kishore said, adding that the relief strengthens not just Vi but India’s broader digital infrastructure ecosystem.\n\nWith regulatory uncertainty easing, Kishore declared a “Vi 2.0 reset” and laid out a three-year roadmap built around what he called the “1-2-3” framework: sustained customer additions, double-digit revenue growth and tripling EBITDA.\n\nTo deliver this, Vi will invest Rs 45,000 crore over the next three years — in addition to Rs 18,000 crore already invested over the past six quarters — taking total planned investment to over Rs 60,000 crore in roughly four years.\n\nThe bulk of the new capital will go toward aggressive network expansion. Vi plans to achieve 4G parity with competitors across its 17 priority circles — which contribute over 99% of revenue — within 12 to 24 months. Simultaneously, it will expand 5G coverage across urban markets with populations above 20,000 over the next 12–30 months.\n\nThe company also aims to convert remaining 2G sites to 4G in select circles, expand fixed wireless access (FWA) offerings for home and small-office users, and prepare for satellite communication services through its partnership with AST SpaceMobile, which Kishore expects to materialise over the next 18–24 months.\n\nSince its follow-on public offer (FPO), Vi has already invested Rs 16,000 crore, adding over 100,000 sites, increasing capacity by 43% in key markets and expanding population coverage from 77% to about 86 percent. The company has launched 5G in 43 cities, with Kerala becoming the first fully covered circle.\n\nOperational metrics are showing early signs of improvement. Annual subscriber losses, which had averaged 15–16 million over recent years, have narrowed to 5.3 million so far this year. Excluding a deliberate slowdown in low-quality customer additions in one quarter, net losses were just 1.5 million — a swing of nearly 12 million compared to prior trends."

HAL would like to lease about 10 to 20 which can be bought from Russia directly in flyaway condition.\n\n“The leasing is a separate track because we buy out the aircraft directly. Manufacturing is setting up the facilities. And, as I said, in three years we will do the roll-out in a semi knock-down condition. Bring all the assemblies, assemble it. That is the target in three years. So, bring in all the facilities, bring in the test equipment and get it going. That is the target for three years,” he said.\n\n“In the next year or so, year and a half, we can get in about 10 aircraft. So, that is the idea that we are bringing in,” he said, adding that he is expecting a demand for over 200 SJ100 aircraft for Indian regional connectivity push.\n\n“We see a good market of upwards of 200 aircraft for this size of India and you know in the local region. So, there is enough market for an aircraft of this size.\n\nThe HAL official said the company would commence production of SJ100 in its existing facilities in the next three-four years.\n\nSunil said the aerospace major is in touch with some companies in GIFT City in Gujarat on leasing issues.\n\nGoing forward, in the next three to four years down the line, the SJ 100 and helicopters are going to become a significant component of the company’s revenues.\n\nHe further said state-owned Pawan Hans Ltd will procure 10 Made-in-India Dhruv New Generation (NG) helicopters from HAL and deploy them for offshore operations of ONGC.\n\nFurther there is an order from BSF for Dhruv NG choppers.\n\nReplying to a query, he said the company clocked Rs 31,000 crore revenues last year and this year it expects 7-8 per cent growth this fiscal."

        "full_content": "The rupee’s slide over the past few months has turned the external sector into a key macro risk just as the government prepares for Budget 2026. With capital flows turning volatile, foreign investors pulling money out of Indian equities and global uncertainty weighing on emerging market currencies, economists say the Budget will be closely watched for signals on how India plans to shore up investor confidence, attract foreign capital and maintain fiscal credibility.\n\nThe rupee has weakened significantly in recent months, moving from around 86 to nearly 92 against the US dollar, driven by a mix of external and domestic pressures. These include delays in the India-US trade deal, sustained foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows, heavy dollar demand from importers and relatively limited intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The currency is currently trading near 91.73 to the dollar.\n\nEconomists point out that the depreciation is no longer just a currency story but a reflection of stress in India’s balance of payments. Gaura Sengupta, an economist at IDFC First Bank, said the capital account turned negative in the third quarter of FY26, amplifying pressure on the rupee.\n\n“The depreciation pressure on the rupee reflects the BoP deficit, with the capital account turning negative in Q3 FY26. The Budget is expected to focus on measures to support capital inflows,” Sengupta said.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Budget 2026 is expected to place renewed emphasis on attracting stable foreign capital. Measures such as enhancing foreign direct investment (FDI) limits in select sectors and offering tax incentives to overseas investors are likely to be considered.\n\nEconomists also expect the government to double down on its investment-led growth strategy through higher on-budget capital expenditure and policies aimed at crowding in private investment.\n\nSupport for exports is another area likely to gain prominence. With global demand remaining uneven, the government may announce targeted measures to diversify export markets for both merchandise and services, reducing dependence on a narrow set of geographies and improving resilience to external shocks.\n\nTax policy could also play a role in calming volatile portfolio flows. Madhavankutty G, group chief economist at Canara Bank said changes in withholding taxes and capital gains tax could help ease concerns among foreign investors and slow FII outflows.\n\n“Some changes in the tax structure, especially on withholding taxes and capital gains tax, can be expected to alleviate concerns on FII outflows,” Madhavankutty said.\n\nAt the same time, global investors will be watching the Budget for reassurance on fiscal discipline. Madhavankutty expects the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to reaffirm the government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation while retaining flexibility to support growth when she presents the Budget on February 1. A clearly articulated medium-term fiscal roadmap, including the debt-to-GDP trajectory, could be crucial in anchoring investor confidence at a time when the rupee and capital flows are under strain."

        "full_content": "PNB Housing Finance has no plans to exit corporate lending and the recent reduction in the loan book was part of a broader revamp of the business, managing director and CEO Ajai Kumar Shukla has said.\n\nThe company has now in place the required structure, leadership and sourcing teams, with plans to grow the segment's share of its total loan book to 8–10 percent within the next three years even as retail lending will continue to dominate the portfolio, Shukla told Moneycontrol in an interview.Edited excerpts:\n\nA fraud account was reported recently, though it was written off in FY23. Why the delay?\n\nAn account turning NPA (non-performing asset) does not automatically qualify as fraud. After the account was written off with 100 percent provisioning, a detailed forensic and due diligence process was undertaken. During this process, certain unfulfilled commitments came to light, following which the board decided to classify it as fraud in line with good governance practices.\n\nHave the regulator been informed and what action is being taken?\n\nYes, the fraud has been reported to the NHB (National Housing Bank) within the stipulated timeline. Legal proceedings are ongoing and remedial actions are in progress. The builder is also exploring options such as bringing in a partner or a buyout to resolve the matter.\n\nDespite a strong overall retail performance, affordable housing disbursements declined 15 percent YoY to Rs 786 crore in the December quarter? Why did this happen when prime and emerging segments are growing?\n\nThe decline in affordable disbursements was largely due to challenges in certain southern markets, particularly Tamil Nadu, following a government ordinance that temporarily disrupted activity. As a precautionary measure, the company adopted a wait-and-watch approach. The issue has since been clarified by the government and the management believes the market is now well placed for a revival.\n\nHow will disbursements shape up now that the issue has been resolved?\n\nThe fourth quarter is traditionally stronger for the industry and the company is already seeing month-on-month improvement. January disbursements are in line with expectations and the management expects the remaining two months of the quarter to be even better.\n\nCorporate loan assets have reduced sharply to Rs 272 crore, down 78 percent. Can we expect corporateloansto go to zero?\n\nNo, corporate loans will not go to zero. The reduction was a conscious strategic decision as the company revamped its corporate finance business. The structure, leadership,and sourcing teams are now in place, and business growth has resumed.\n\nIn the current calendar year, some momentum will be visible, translating into around 3-4 percent of the book by (the end of) FY26. FY27 will see further acceleration, with corporate loans rising to around 6-7 percent. Over the next two-three years, the corporate loan book is expected to stabilise at around 8-10 percent of the total portfolio, with retail forming the remaining 90 percent.\n\nWith pressure on NIMs across the sector due to rate cuts, how is the company planning to protect margins?\n\nThe company’s NIM stands at around 3.63 percent, within its guided range of 3.6-3.7 percent, which it continues to maintain. The strategy focuses on increasing the share of affordable, emerging, and construction finance businesses, which offer better yields and help sustain margins.\n\nManagement believes there is limited scope for further rate cuts. However, if a cut does occur, the benefit may be partially passed on by banks and institutions. Any impact on margins would be offset by higher-yielding segments like prime, emerging, and construction finance. The company aims to maintain NIMs in the 3.6-3.7 percent range even in that scenario.\n\nCapital adequacy has declined sequentially. Is there any plan to raise capital?\n\nThe company remains well-capitalised and does not see any need for raising capital in the near term.\n\nBorrowing costs have reduced sharply. What has driven this improvement?\n\nThe reduction is mainly due to better-negotiated term loans, benefits from repo-linked and MCLR-linked lending and refinancing through NHB at subsidised rates. Continuous churning from higher-cost to lower-cost borrowings has also helped bring down the blended cost.\n\nThe borrowing pattern is expected to remain largely the same in the near term, with adjustments depending on the interest rate trajectory in the next financial year.\n\nGross NPAs in the affordable segment have risen to 0.66 percent. Should this be a concern?\n\nWhile GNPA has edged up, it remains among the best in the industry and well within the company’s guidance. The increase was partly due to temporary disruptions in southern markets. Asset quality has since stabilised, with minimal difference between Q2 and Q3 figures, and management does not see any major concern."

        "full_content": "Gold and silver ETFs surged up to 5 percent on January 28, mirroring the sharp rise in precious metals. Analysts have commented on whether it is time to take money out of equity markets and increase exposure to precious metals.\n\nElevated valuations in several markets, particularly in the AI and tech sectors, along with concerns about rising debt and earnings sustainability, mean equities are facing tighter conditions than they have in recent years, said Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead, VT Markets.\n\nWhat makes gold and silver so attractive?\n\nThe analyst further said that alongside this, Indian markets are facing the impact of wider macro issues with slowing growth signals, persistent geopolitical risk, and uncertainty around the path of interest rates. All of this combined makes gold and silver more attractive as defensive assets for investors, he said.\n\n\"Gold and silver also continue to look attractive. With real yields showing signs of peaking and central banks maintaining strong gold purchases, precious metals are benefiting from their role as stores of value. Silver adds an additional layer, given its industrial demand tied to energy transition and electronics,\" Maxwell said.\n\nThe rally is fueled by a perfect storm of factors heightened geopolitical risks which includes Middle East tensions and tariff threats under US policy shifts, said Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza. “This has positioned precious metals as a classic safe haven play,” he added.\n\nWhile safe-haven demand and industrial catalysts remain supportive, experts caution that this is not the optimal entry point for fresh allocations.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the decision should not be driven by recent price movements, but by how these assets behave and where they fit in a long term portfolio, said Subhendu Harichandan, Executive Director, Anand Rathi Wealth.\n\nFor investors, a lot will depend on portfolio objectives, time horizons and balance, Maxwell said. Gradually reallocating a portion of equity gains into gold or silver ETFs can help hedge downside risks, inflation surprises and policy missteps, according to the analyst. “However, making a more substantial shift away from equities assumes a sharp correction that is not yet clearly established yet,” he added.\n\nSiddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara, said that although gold and silver ETFs are surging to fresh lifetime highs, it would be premature for investors to shift a large part of equity capital to precious metals at these levels.\n\n“During times of volatility, metals serve as excellent portfolio diversifiers and thus, perform well but in the long run, equities are the main contributors to wealth creation. Therefore, a balanced strategy, first of all, maintaining a core equity exposure and then, gradually adding gold and silver through small, phased purchasing on bottoming, helps one stay on the right side of risk management and one's long, term plans as opposed to just following the recent peaks,” he said.\n\nChasing the recent velocity of gains risks buying at near-term peaks, while patience and strategic rebalancing will serve long-term goals better, according to the analyst. With gold and silver prices witnessing a sharp surge, investors in precious metals may consider booking partial profits at current levels rather than making fresh allocations, said Swapnil Aggarwal, Director, VSRK Capital.\n\nWith prices at all-time highs, there is significant risk in entering at these levels. It is prudent to book partial profits and prioritize gold over silver, said Jiju Vidyadharan, Senior Director, Crisil Intelligence.\n\nTiwari from Bonanza has highlighted different investment strategy for different kinds of investors:\n\nInvestors who don’t have any exposure to precious metals:These investors should consider gradually adding 5-10 percent via ETFs to hedge against ongoing uncertainty, inflation, or dollar weakness.\n\nInvestors who are heavily invested in equity markets:A partial rebalance by trimming overperforming stocks to fund metals allocation can improve risk adjusted returns without abandoning growth potential.\n\nCautious investors:If you are concerned about near term froth, you should monitor for corrections strong rallies often see healthy pullbacks before resuming. Avoid leverage or over concentration, the analyst said.\n\nDiversification remains the timeless principle. Equities offer long term compounding tied to corporate earnings, while precious metals provide insurance against systemic risks, Tiwari added.\n\nAjit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking, concluded by saying that gold and silver are not substitutes for equities - they are portfolio stabilisers. “With equities still driven by earnings growth and metals acting as a hedge against global uncertainty, currency volatility, and geopolitical risks, the right approach is not switching, but rebalancing. Investors should maintain a diversified asset mix across equities, debt, and precious metals, using metals as a strategic allocation rather than a tactical trade,” he said.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here."

        "full_content": "Sterlite Technologies has flagged a fresh supply-chain risk from China even as demand improves, primarily driven by North American telecom fibre rollouts and data centre buildouts.\n\nThe company warned that restricted exports of germanium, vital for optical fibre manufacturing, from China, which accounts for around 80 percent of the global supply, could add to cost pressures, alongside American tariffs.\n\nSterlite Technologies chief executive officer Ankit Agarwal told Moneycontrol, “Availability of germanium will be a risk factor for us, which we are looking to mitigate.”\n\nThe company is evaluating alternative sourcing options in Europe, the US and other geographies amid a broader global push to secure critical mineral supply chains.\n\nAgarwal said the company expects improved margins but it would depend on two or three factors, including mitigate or reducing the impact of US tariffs, which remain significant, and availability of germanium.\n\n“More than 70–80 percent of germanium supply comes from China and sourcing is currently a challenge due to restrictions,” he said.\n\nGermanium is a key input in optical fibre manufacturing, used to raise the refractive index of the fibre core and enable efficient, low-loss signal transmission.\n\nHigh-purity germanium dioxide is added during production to improve telecom and data centre performance.\n\nChinese curbs can directly impact fibre production costs and supply chains.\n\nAgarwal said rare earth self-sufficiency is becoming a policy priority globally, including in India.\n\nThe caution on raw materials comes even as STL narrowed quarterly loss and reported higher EBITDA for the December quarter , supported by improving demand in North America and growing traction in the data centre and enterprise segment.\n\nAgarwal said STL remains focused on the US and Europe, where fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) expansion, 5G deployments and accelerating data centre capital expenditure are driving demand.\n\nBeyond hyperscaler investments, fibre requirements within and between data centres are also growing.\n\nThe company secured nearly Rs 500 crore in orders from the data centre and enterprise segment, with the order book improving sequentially. This segment now contributes about 20 percent to revenue and is expected to rise to 30 percent over the next 12–18 months, the company said.\n\nMargins, however, remain under pressure from US tariffs. While reported EBITDA margins are currently around 11–12 percent, Agarwal said they would have been closer to 19–20 percent in the absence of tariffs.\n\nSTL is targeting utilisation levels above 70 percent, which it believes can sustainably generate 20 percent EBITDA margins.\n\nTo cushion the tariff impact, STL is optimising output at its US cable facility while continuing to serve the market through both domestic and global operations.\n\nRevenue contribution from the US increased to nearly 36 percent from about 25 percent last year, with both volumes and revenue rising. Agarwal expressed hope that an interim India–US bilateral trade agreement could provide relief.\n\nOn broader market trends, North America is leading the recovery in global fibre demand, driven by telecom and data centre investments. Europe remains stable but is expected to accelerate data centre build-outs amid supportive regulations.\n\nIn India, BharatNet investments are expected to provide medium-term visibility, while the domestic data centre market, currently around 1.5 gigawatts, could expand to 7–8 gigawatts by 2030, creating incremental demand for fiber infrastructure. Fibre-to-the-home and fibre-to-enterprise deployments are also expected to remain strong.\n\nWhile recent data centre interconnect (DCI) wins have largely come from North American telecom customers, Agarwal said global hyperscaler investments in Europe and Asia could translate into similar opportunities over time, though near-term growth remains concentrated in the US.\n\nAt home, he expects all three private telecom operators, including Vodafone Idea, following clarity on adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, to continue investing in fibre networks to support 5G rollouts, FTTH expansion and data centre connectivity."

The surge, which mirrored international markets, is driven by escalating geopolitical concerns, US tariff threats, a weakening rupee, robust industrial demand and strong speculative interest.\n\nThe India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA) pegged the metal's price at Rs 3,61,821 per kilogram at 12:30 pm, up 5.64 percent from the previous day's close at Rs 3,42,507 per kilogram on January 27.\n\nOn the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), silver futures surged to a new peak of Rs 3,82,479, and continued to hover at Rs 3,78,813, representing 6.32 percent increase from the previous close.\n\nIn the international market, Comex spot silver was trading above $114 per ounce, which is a 8.32 percent gain from the previous close.\n\nMeanwhile, the rupee was trading at 91.62 against the US dollar, up 0.19 percent from its previous close. A weak rupee has made imports and commodities more expensive.\n\nHere is how a kilogram of silver has moved.\n\nThe Augmont Bullion, published on January 27, said silver surged past the $115 mark, driven primarily by a sharp weakening of the US dollar and rising policy uncertainty.\n\n\"The dollar slipping to a four-year low, combined with slumping US consumer confidence and concerns over the labour market, has strengthened the case for defensive assets,\" the report stated.\n\nAdded to this, tariff threats and perceived pressure on Fed independence have amplified geopolitical and policy risk premiums—firmly underpinning gold and silver prices.\n\nThe report said that silver is resuming higher towards $120 (Rs 3,90,000). Key support is seen at $103 (Rs 3,40,000); a break could lead to retracement towards $100 and $97."

        "full_content": "Zoho has entered the enterprise resource planning (ERP) market, taking on global giants such as SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft in a space long dominated by legacy players.\n\nThe company is launching its ERP platform first in India, positioning it as a more integrated, affordable, and user-friendly alternative for businesses.\n\nAt the same time, Zoho has announced the expansion of its presence in Kumbakonam with a new campus that can eventually accommodate up to 2,000 employees, strengthening its hub-and-spoke model and its focus on rural development through technology.\n\nExplaining the thinking behind this move, founder and chief scientist Sridhar Vembu says legacy ERP companies are “bloated, expensive and greedy,” echoing what customers themselves feel.\n\nThat critique shapes Zoho’s ambition to build simpler, customizable, and India-first products.\n\nIn this conversation with Moneycontrol, Vembu speaks about Zoho’s ERP strategy, the Kumbakonam expansion, plans for north India, semiconductor design, navigating the AI wave, and why patience and long-term product thinking remain central to Zoho’s approach.\n\nWhy does Zoho believe it can challenge legacy ERP players?\n\nERP is competitive, but Zoho knows how to compete. We have proven that on a global scale. What I like about this market is that we are facing legacy players like SAP and Oracle who are bloated, expensive, greedy, and just money-grubbing. Customers themselves say these things. We want to directly attack that with a much better value proposition that is more user-friendly, customizable, and ready to go.\n\nWhy launch ERP in India first?\n\nIndia is not an afterthought for us. For SAP or Oracle, India is an afterthought. For us, it is our first market. That is why our ERP is tailored for India from the beginning and deeply integrated with India’s DPI stack, including banking, payments, and e-commerce.\n\nWhat makes Zoho’s ERP different?\n\nIt is much more user-friendly and much more integrated. Nobody does e-commerce well in the ERP space. We do. It becomes a kind of digital nervous system for the enterprise. It is more customizable and much more affordable.\n\nHow big is the ERP opportunity?\n\nGlobally, it is at least a $253 billion market, bigger than CRM. We have built this system over 17 years with all the subsystems. We are the only player that comprehensively covers all aspects of ERP. We expect to take a decent and fair share of the market, though I cannot predict exact numbers.\n\nWhat does today’s Kumbakonam announcement mean to you personally?\n\nThis is my native region. People often think I am from Tenkasi, but I was actually born not far from here. So it is a particularly special moment for us.\n\nWhat are Zoho’s plans for Kumbakonam?\n\nWe already have about 250 people spread across two offices here. We want to invest and grow in this region just like we have done in Tenkasi. Most of our investments are going into rural parts, and this region is a key part of that push. We think of it as rural development through research and development.\n\nHow many jobs can the new campus support?\n\nWe have about 250 people now and want to grow that to around 2,000. That is what the campus is built for. How fast we reach that depends entirely on how the products grow.\n\nHow is this similar to your hub-and-spoke model?\n\nIt is very similar to what we pioneered in Tenkasi. We plan schools, and we may eventually run our own K-12 school under NAOS. We may run clinics. We invest in rural communities, like restoring ponds. We encourage employees to participate in community activities. We are not here just to build software. We also want to be part of the holistic development of the region.\n\nHow do you see the talent pool in Kumbakonam?\n\nThe talent situation is good all over India. Kumbakonam is special because this is the land of Srinivasa Ramanujan. There is strong mathematical and software talent here. We invest heavily in training and in nurturing this talent.\n\nWhat are the timelines for scaling this campus?\n\nThat depends on product adoption and global growth. We do not try to predict exact timelines. But the campus is built so that we can scale up to ten times in terms of talent pool.\n\nWatch the video interview: Small town, Big tech: Sridhar Vembu on Zoho’s rural push, AI Bubble, SaaS consolidation & many more\n\nWhat is Zoho’s right to win in ERP?\n\nOur value proposition is simple. We are more affordable, more customizable, and much more user-friendly. We are deeply integrated with our own ecosystem. And India is our first market, not an afterthought. That is why we believe we can win.\n\nAre you still planning expansion in north India?\n\nYes. We paused for about a year or a year and a half because we had to navigate the AI shift. We did not want to distract ourselves. Now we feel more confident. This year, we will have some announcement from Uttar Pradesh.\n\nWhat is happening with your semiconductor plans?\n\nWe are investing in semiconductor design. We have put the fab plan on hold for now because of our focus on AI. We will revisit it in a couple of years. We have too many things going on right now.\n\nDo you think there is an AI bubble?\n\nThere is definitely a bubble component. A company raised $2 billion at a $12 billion valuation with no product, just based on the founders’ resumes. Now people are leaving and there is still no product. That tells you everything. AI is real, but you can over-invest and waste a lot of money. That will happen in AI too.\n\nHow is Zoho approaching AI differently?\n\nWe are both AI-boosting our business and AI-proofing our business. We are confident we will survive and prosper. Just like SaaS came back to reality and Zoho was one of the winners, we hope to navigate AI in the same way.\n\nShould India build massive foundational models like the US?\n\nThere are three problems. First, India is limited to around 50,000 GPUs, while the major players have millions. Second, GPUs are extremely expensive. Third, the power requirement is enormous. Each GPU uses 500 to 700 watts, and they are talking about gigawatt-scale data centres. We cannot blindly copy the US. We have to be smarter and more patient.\n\nThere has been some talk about a slowdown in Arattai’s growth. How do you see its progress?\n\nPace is not the most important thing for us. What matters is consistency and seriousness in execution. The team has been working continuously on Arattai, even during holidays, and that shows their commitment. It is doing well, and we are steadily improving the product. We are focused on building it the right way rather than rushing for quick milestones.\n\nWhat can we expect from Zoho this year?\n\nThere will be many product launches. We have a strong pipeline. More importantly, we are combining everything into a powerful platform. Our “operating system for business” is becoming much stronger, with deeper AI integration and our own models, not just API wrappers.\n\nConsolidation will continue. There are too many companies. Many are buying growth through marketing and struggling to make profits. There will be fewer players, and we hope to be one of the winners.\n\nHow would you sum up Zoho’s approach today? And what would be your budget expectations?\n\nWe focus on patience, long-term product building, and strong R&D. We have navigated major technology shifts before, and we will do it again. My only ask from the budget is that it should focus on R&D and accelerate R&D investments in India."

        "full_content": "Axis Bank’s sharp rally, following its Q3FY26 earnings, has once again altered the pecking order among India’s top private lenders, reviving a valuation battle with Kotak Mahindra Bank that has surfaced only sporadically over the past decade.\n\nOn January 27, 2026, Axis Bank shares surged about 5 percent, climbing to fresh multi-month highs. Kotak Mahindra Bank, by contrast, endured a weaker session the same day, with its shares falling over 4 percent after it reported quarterly numbers that were largely in line with expectations but failed to excite investors.\n\nThe rally helped propel Axis Bank past Kotak Mahindra Bank in market capitalisation, a crossover that has occurred only a handful of times in recent history and was last seen in April 2024, and before that in September 2016.\n\nBloomberg data around January 27 showed that Axis Bank is valued at roughly Rs 4.1 lakh crore, marginally above Kotak’s Rs 4 lakh crore. While the gap remained narrow and volatile, the symbolic crossover underscored how quickly investor preferences can shift on earnings delivery.\n\nMomentum extends into January 28\n\nOn January 28, Axis Bank’s stock continued its positive momentum, rising approximately 3.1 percent and was trading around Rs 1,352 on the NSE at 10:30 am.\n\nKotak Mahindra Bank, meanwhile, was relatively subdued, with its shares trading around Rs 1,505, up about Rs 1.50 or 0.37 percent, significantly underperforming Axis Bank.\n\nAxis Bank’s stock climbed as high as Rs 1,325.60 on January 27, extending gains amid heavy volumes after the bank reported a standalone net profit of Rs 6,490 crore, up year on year (YoY), supported by a 5 percent rise in net interest income (NII) to Rs 14,287 crore.\n\nThe earnings beat triggered a flurry of positive analyst responses.\n\nAccording to analyst reports from IIFL and Motilal Oswal, despite margin pressures seen across the sector due to higher funding costs, Axis managed to hold its net interest margin (NIM) at 3.64 percent, reassuring investors about its balance-sheet resilience.\n\nCiti upgraded Axis Bank to ‘Buy’ and raised its price target to Rs 1,463, citing strong core earnings momentum and improving return ratios, while Bernstein reiterated an Outperform rating with a Rs 1,480 target.\n\nMoreover, according to consensus data on Bloomberg, nearly 44 out of 50 analysts tracking the stock now recommend a Buy, marking a clear shift from the more mixed buy-hold stance that has prevailed since early 2022.\n\nAnalysts pointed to Axis Bank’s consistent execution, steady loan growth and controlled credit costs as reasons for the re-rating.\n\nKotak, on the other hand, posted a 5 percent YoY rise in NII to Rs 7,565 crore, while standalone net profit grew a modest 4 percent to Rs 3,446 crore. Margins remained healthy at 4.54 percent, among the best in the sector, but higher operating expenses, particularly employee costs linked to the implementation of the new Labour Code, weighed on profitability and investor sentiment.\n\nValuation has also emerged as a sticking point for Kotak.\n\nAt current levels, the bank trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of about 21–22, significantly higher than Axis Bank’s 15-16 times, a premium that some brokerages such as IIFL and Motilal Oswal have questioned amid slower earnings momentum.\n\nThe January 2026 crossover, however, is not the first time Axis Bank has overtaken Kotak in market value.\n\nA similar episode played out in April 2024, when Axis replaced Kotak as one of India’s most valued private lenders after Kotak’s stock plunged following regulatory action by the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nAt the time, the RBI had restricted Kotak from onboarding customers digitally and issuing credit cards, citing repeated failures to address serious deficiencies in its IT systems. Kotak shares fell as much as 11 percent in a single session, eroding nearly Rs 40,000 crore in market value and dragging its market capitalisation down to about Rs 3.3 lakh crore, while Axis stood around Rs 3.5 lakh crore.\n\nThat 2024 episode was significant not just for the ranking shift but also for its historical resonance.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg data, the last time Axis Bank was valued higher than Kotak Mahindra Bank before 2024 was in September 2016, nearly eight years earlier. The rout in Kotak’s stock at that time resulted in an estimated $1.2-billion erosion in the wealth of founder Uday Kotak, who holds about 25.9 percent stake in the bank.\n\nMid-sized bank battle intensifies\n\nThe renewed Axis–Kotak crossover in January 2026 comes against the backdrop of a broader recovery in the Indian banking sector.\n\nCredit growth has remained firm, asset quality has continued to improve, and balance sheets are far healthier than in previous cycles, an analyst told Moneycontrol.\n\nHowever, the analyst added that banks are also grappling with rising funding costs, intense competition for deposits and the need to repriceloanscarefully to protect margins.\n\n\"In this environment, earnings consistency and execution have become critical differentiators,\" the analyst said.\n\nThe current market-cap tussle also reflects a broader theme playing out in the Indian banking landscape, with the intensifying battle for supremacy in the mid-sized bank segment.\n\nWhile the pecking order at the top, led by HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, has remained largely stable, competition below that tier has been fluid.\n\nAccording to a Moneycontrol analysis, Kotak has consolidated its position among mid-sized lenders over the years, but the renewed challenge from Axis highlights how leadership in this segment remains contingent on earnings execution."

Analysts have suggested what allotted investors should do.\n\nThe shares of the Bengaluru-based technology-led logistics solutions provider listed at 112.60 apiece on NSE, marking a discount of 9.19 percent over the IPO price of Rs 124 apiece.\n\nThe stock then recovered some losses, rising around 6 percent from its listing price to trade at Rs 119.67 apiece. However, it is still down around 3.5 percent from its IPO price of Rs 124 apiece.\n\nShadowfax’sweak stock market debutindicates cautious investor sentiment towards the logistics and new-age business space, said Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth at Swastika Investmart. The discounted listing suggests valuation concerns, and the stock may remain volatile or range-bound in the near term as markets focus on profitability, cash flows and execution, she added.\n\nIPO allottees may hold with a strict stop loss at Rs 105 to protect downside risk, according to the analyst, who further said that fresh investors should avoid immediate entry and consider buying only after price stability, with a similar stop loss of Rs 104–105.\n\n“On the upside, the ₹120–124 zone is likely to act as a resistance in the short term,” she added.\n\nShadowfax’s muted listing reflects valuation fatigue in the IPO market rather than doubts over the business, said Gaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk. \"While the company boasts strong revenue growth and a pan-India logistics network, weak non-institutional demand and thin listing sentiment capped upside. Near-term stock performance will now hinge on execution, margin improvement and sustained profitability rather than growth alone,\" he added.\n\nShadowfax is a technology-driven, asset-light logistics company focused on last-mile delivery, express parcels, reverse logistics and quick commerce services, said Mahesh M. Ojha, VP Research and Business Development at Kantilal Chhaganlal Securities. The company operates across more than 2,300 cities and 14,700 PIN codes and serves clients such as Flipkart, Meesho, Swiggy, Blinkit and Nykaa.\n\nAccording to him, the stock may be suitable for high-risk investors given the overall positive industry outlook. Investors with a long-term perspective who have already applied may consider holding the stock, while short-term investors could look to book gains on listing, if any. Fresh investors may wait for price discovery after listing.\n\nThe weak market debut comes despite the IPO of Shadowfax Technologies closing with 1.68 times subscription during its three days of public bidding between January 20 and January 22. Retail individual investors (RII) and qualified institutional buyers (QIB) had booked their respective reserved portion more than 2 times, while non-institutional investors (NII) subscribed 54 percent of their allotted quota.\n\nBengaluru-based technology-led logistics solutions provider Shadowfax Tech moved to the primary capital market to raise Rs 1,907.2 crore through its initial public offering (IPO), which comprised a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 1,000 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of shares worth Rs 907.2 crore by several investors including Flipkart, Eight Roads Investments, Qualcomm, and NewQuest Asia Fund.\n\nThe price band for the IPO was set at Rs 118-124 per share. Investors could bid for a minimum of 120 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,160, and in multiples thereafter.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here."

        "full_content": "India’s crypto sector is seeking capital gains tax rationalisation and re-evaluation of the 1\n\npercent tax deducted at source (TDS)  on every exchange transaction in the Union Budget for 2026-2027.\n\nIt’s going to be more than four years since the 30 percent virtual digital asset (VDA) tax on gains and 1 percent TDS were  levied on  crypto asset transactions, decimating trading volumes on exchanges by over 80 percent. The industry is expecting a revision of these taxes in the Union Budget to catch up with the global crypto sector that had hit an inflection point in 2025, with regulatory movement in the US with the passing of stablecoin-focused Genius Act, followed by a massive Bitcoin rally.\n\nAccording to Dilip Chenoy, Chairman, Bharat Web3 Association (BWA), the current tax regime has no provision for loss set-off, and a one percent TDS on every transaction has reduced onshore liquidity and shifted a significant share of trading to offshore platforms outside effective Indian regulatory oversight.\n\n“This has weakened compliant domestic exchanges and reduced regulatory visibility,” he said, quite contrary to the government’s very perception of implementing TDS for traceability and transparency of crypto asset movements.\n\nChenoy sees Budget 2026-27 as an opportunity to correct these distortions. “The current tax design affects the broader blockchain ecosystem, pushes investment and activity offshore, and limits India’s ability to retain innovation, employment, and accountable growth in the sector\".\n\nIndustry demands expanding of TDS threshold\n\nAshish Singhal, Co-founder, CoinSwitch, one of the largest crypto investment platforms in the country, is hoping for a reduction in TDS on VDA transactions from 1 percent to 0.01 percent.\n\nSinghal said, “Raising the TDS threshold to Rs 5 lakh would help protect small investors from a disproportionate impact.”\n\nIndian exchanges directly deduct TDS on all transactions. At present, the TDS deduction threshold is about Rs 10,000 per year for most categories of taxpayers, individuals and traders and Rs 50,000 per year for small traders and specified persons.\n\nSB Seker, Head of APAC at Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, recommended removal of transaction-level levies in favour of net-revenue generating corporate taxes. “This can improve fairness for retail participants and indicate to them India has moved past the tax-and-deter regime towards a fuller licence-and-supervise one,” he said.\n\n“The way forward lies in pragmatic reforms that bring users back to compliant platforms while strengthening compliance,” said Sumit Gupta, Co-founder at CoinDCX.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by CoinSwitch, taxation is also influencing market behaviour. Nearly 59 percent of respondents have reported reduced participation in crypto investing or trading due to the prevailing tax regime.\n\nAbout 61 percent of respondents are in favour of integrating crypto into India’s mainstream financial taxation system, believing crypto should be taxed similarly to equities or mutual funds. Over 80 percent of the survey respondents want crypto regulations.\n\nWhat was the crypto regulatory update by Finance Ministry?\n\nEarlier this month, the Finance Ministry’s Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)issued updated guidelinesto tighten business operation practices, cybersecurity disclosures and KYC norms for VDA companies registering in India.\n\nAs per the updated guidelines, crypto platforms now have to do more than just allow simple document uploads. Users must take a“live selfie”using software that verifies their presence, typically through eye-blinking or head movement to prevent the use of static photos or deepfakes.\n\nExchanges must record the exact latitude and longitude, date, timestamp, and IP address from which a user starts creating an account.\n\nBinance’s Seker said such regulatory clarity will, in turn, attract more responsible capital. “Clear, consistent operating standards for VDA platforms, aligned with India’s AML/KYC and investor protection priorities, will encourage responsible capital investment, create skilled jobs, and build domestic capabilities,” he said."

        "full_content": "The shares ofShadowfax Technologiesmade a weak debut on stock markets on January 28, listing at Rs 112.60 apiece on NSE. This marks a discount of 9.19 percent over the IPO price of Rs 124 apiece.\n\nThe company debuted with a market capitalisation of Rs 6,509.78 crore.\n\nAfter the weak market debut, the stock dropped another 3 percent to close at Rs 109.18 apiece on its debut day. The stock is currently around 12 percent lower than its IPO price, and has a market capitalisation of Rs 6,312.06 crore..\n\nListing performance vs grey market estimates:\n\nThe listing has missed grey market expectations. Ahead of listing, the unlisted shares of Shadowfax Technologies were trading with a grey market discount o 2.82 percent over the IPO price at Rs 120.5 apiece. The grey market estimates quoted by the site has significantly fallen from the 12.90 percent quoted on January 15.\n\nAccording to IPO Watch, the unlisted shares of the company were trading flat at the IPO price at Rs 124 apiece in the grey market.\n\nThe weak market debut comes despite the IPO of Shadowfax Technologies closing with1.68 times subscriptionduring its three days of public bidding between January 20 and January 22. Retail individual investors (RII) and qualified institutional buyers (QIB) had booked their respective reserved portion more than 2 times, while non-institutional investors (NII) subscribed 54 percent of their allotted quota.\n\nBengaluru-based technology-led logistics solutions provider Shadowfax Tech moved to the primary capital market to raise Rs 1,907.2 crore through its initial public offering (IPO), which comprised a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 1,000 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of shares worth Rs 907.2 crore by several investors including Flipkart, Eight Roads Investments, Qualcomm, and NewQuest Asia Fund.\n\nThe price band for the IPO was set at Rs 118-124 per share. Investors could bid for a minimum of 120 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,160, and in multiples thereafter.\n\nHow will the IPO proceeds be used?\n\nThe company proposes to utilise proceeds from the fresh issue towards funding enhancing capacity in terms of network infrastructure, funding of lease payments for new first mile, last mile, and sort centres, as well as towards branding, marketing, and communication initiatives, unidentified inorganic acquisitions, and general corporate purposes.\n\nA day before the IPO opened for public bidding, Shadowfax announced that it has raised Rs 856.02 crore from 39 anchor investors on January 19.\n\n\"Out of the total allocation, 3.67 crore equity shares worth Rs 455.73 crore were allocated to nine domestic mutual funds including ICICI Prudential AMC, Nippon Life India, Motilal Oswal AMC, Bandhan Mutual Fund, HSBC MF, Helios MF, JM Financial MF, and Trust Mutual Fund,\" Shadowfax Technologies in its filing to exchanges said.\n\nICICI Prudential AMC was the largest investor in the anchor book, acquiring 1.53 crore equity shares for Rs 190 crore through its four schemes - ICICI Prudential Flexicap Fund, ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage Fund, ICICI Prudential Transportation and Logistics Fund, and ICICI Prudential Exports and Services Fund.\n\nShadowfax is a technology-driven, asset-light logistics company focused on last-mile delivery, express parcels, reverse logistics and quick commerce services, said Mahesh M. Ojha, VP Research and Business Development at Kantilal Chhaganlal Securities. The company operates across more than 2,300 cities and 14,700 PIN codes and serves clients such as Flipkart, Meesho, Swiggy, Blinkit and Nykaa.\n\nThe analyst highlighted that the IPO valuation appears relatively rich, when compared to peers like Delhivery. The business also faces intense competition and customer concentration risks, with a significant portion of revenue coming from a small number of large clients.\n\nAccording to him, the stock may be suitable for high-risk investors given the overall positive industry outlook. Investors with a long-term perspective who have already applied may consider holding the stock, while short-term investors could look to book gains on listing, if any. Fresh investors may wait for price discovery after listing.\n\nGaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk, noted that Shadowfax offers a compelling play on India’s rapidly growing e-commerce and quick-commerce ecosystem. \"With pan-India reach across over 14,700 pincodes and a client roster that includes Flipkart, Meesho, Swiggy, Zomato, and Blinkit, the company has demonstrated strong revenue growth (~32% CAGR FY23–25) and operational scalability through its large gig-based delivery network. Its asset-light model and EBITDA-positive performance since FY24 highlight its improving profitability trajectory,\" the analyst said.\n\nHe however cautioned that investors should be mindful of the risks and structural constraints. \"Margins remain thin, ROE and ROCE are modest, and revenue is concentrated with its top client contributing around 50%. At the upper price band, the IPO implies an EV/EBITDA of ~106x, which is rich compared with peers, suggesting that current valuations already reflect significant growth expectations,\" he said.\n\nOverall, Shadowfax offers long-term exposure to India’s logistics and hyperlocal delivery sector, but the IPO is better suited for investors with a long-term horizon, who are comfortable tracking execution, client diversification, and margin expansion over time, the analyst said. He added that for short-term listing gains, the risk-reward appears balanced but neutral."

        "full_content": "SBFC Finance’s stock plunged 11 percent on January 26 after the company announced that co-founder Aseem Dhru was stepping down as the managing director and chief executive officer.\n\nAnnouncing the changes, which took investors by surprise, the company said on January 24 that co-founder Mahesh Dayani would take over as MD & CEO from April 1. Dhru would transition to a non-executive, non-independent director role designated as vice chairman.\n\nDhru, who co-founded SBFC Finance with Dayani in September 2017 after leaving HDFC Bank, told Moneycontrol in an interview that he would be around to ensure a smooth transition and time will bear out his decision to handover control to Dayani.Edited excerpts:\n\nStock market hasn’t taken your stepping down kindly. For an investor, it’s impossible to separate you from the company. What do you have to say?\n\nUnlike a lot of other companies, SBFC has always been a professionally run company. We were not promoter run at any point of time and that is how it was built — professionals who came together to with a common objective to build an institution that can outlast us.\n\nBy definition, individuals have finite lives, energies and timeframes. The real test of what has been built is whether it outlasts you, because if you have to keep doing it all the time, then clearly it hasn’t been built right.\n\nNormally what I've seen in financial services is that it has been a challenge to bring about a transition. (With SBFC) I thought that we can do it a little differently where I move away from the role of a player into that of a coach. I can be of help and contribute to the company to ensure that the transition is smooth. The company's fundamentals remain where they are and the numbers will do the talking.\n\nBut as much as we want to say that companies are larger than the persons running it, they are also a reflection of their CEOs …\n\nThere is no doubt that individuals have their stamps, especially in financial services. Unlike in manufacturing or other businesses, like organisations of the scale of Coca-Cola or cement or steel,  even if the CEO is not a very good, the company faces temporary challenges but manages to get by just fine. Somebody else comes and builds it up.\n\nIn financial services it is tricky. The impact of CEO on financial services is very direct and present. The comfort here (with SBFC) is that it is not a call that the organisation is taking because we (the founding team) built this organisation together from Day One. It is just that I had more visibility because of the nature of the designation.\n\nWhat was that tipping point that convinced you that Mahesh Dayani should take over?\n\nIt’s a job which requires extreme amount of passion, focus and energy. You need to demonstrate it on a day-to-day basis. The minute you realise that you are not pulling your weight is when you realise that time has come to give it to the person who can take the organisation forward.\n\nGenuinely, I believe that at this moment, he (Dayani) is better placed than me to take this company forward. I hope the numbers and history will wear me out. I have literally put my money on him! There are many interests in life one wants to pursue, not necessarily within the financial sector.Aur bhi gham hain zamane mein, mohabbat ke siwa. Also, once you get very good at something, it becomes second nature and we become comfortable but then growth stops. Growth only comes from the zone of discomfort, and to that extent, I'm putting myself in a zone of discomfort.\n\nYour departure comes at a time when growth seems to be slowing and the industry is not in a comfortable position. Even larger players are under pressure.\n\nIn finance business, there is always demand. The challenge is to segregate between need and demand. It is just the ability of a customer to repay theloanwhich needs assessment.\n\nIf you read the RBI’s financial stability report, it very clearly states that the small Indian retail consumer is overleveraged. You need to be careful that you don't really tip him off, which is what happened with microfinance and unsecured lending. One has to be careful that in the chase for growth, you don't really give loan to a guy who struggle to repay.\n\nGrowth is a function of what the market is and what your size is. If you're small, then the market size doesn't really matter.  We can decide at what rate we want to grow. The challenge is in setting the culture of the company and what growth it can digest. Cancer also is ultimately growth! We need to be careful of that in all times.\n\nSBFC has moved in the construct of 5–7 percent quarter-on-quarter growth, so that ultimately we build a boring compounding business and not something that is exciting and can deliver great results in good times, and then struggle in difficult ones.\n\nIn 2022, you were one of the first to flag the stress that was building in the retail space. Four years later, we are still talking about it.\n\nIf most of the debt is not going towards asset creation, which is what the RBI report says, that is not a good place to be. When growth has been above the pace that the system can take, it has led to accidents, whether it is credit costs going up or operating costs peaking.\n\nSecondly, the end use of money has always defined the outcome of your loan. If the end use has been productive, the outcome has been better. When the end use is non-productive that’s where the problem starts for a lender.\n\nIt is also about the risk spectrum one is operating in. If I were a bank and operating at the best level of credit risk, the concern is lower because the borrower is a little more aware and has multiple means to repay the loan. When lending to small businesses and individuals at the bottom of the pyramid, they do not have the discipline or the savings. You have to be more careful than others because the customer segment is a vulnerable one. Most Indians are one hospitalisation away from bankruptcy and that’s the challenge.\n\nFrom inception to where SBFC is now, is it a \"mission accomplished\"  for you?\n\nWe set out to build an institution that will create societal value over cycles. It's good where we have come, so far. We are very happy. God has been kind. We couldn't have hoped for a better outcome but the job isn't anywhere (near) done yet. For that satisfaction, I will have to wait a decade at least.\n\nWhat is your next entrepreneurial bug?\n\nNothing at the moment. The focus is just to ensure that the transition is smooth and I keep giving all the support it needs. For me, the salary stops but the work doesn't.\n\nYou also wanted to see SBFC as a small finance bank. Does the idea still interest you?\n\nIt does but the current regulation doesn't allow it. Promoter ownership cannot be more than 40 percent and we are 51 percent foreign owned. Right now the focus is to just build a wonderful NBFC instead of building just one more bank.\n\nA lot of large banks might start looking out for CEOs in the months to come. Would running a bank interest you?\n\nAs they say, never say never but that is not on the horizon or on my mind as of now. The focus is to ensure that SBFC has a smooth transition. Until I accomplish that, I wouldn't feel that I've done justice to either myself or to those who have trusted me.\n\nWould your association continue for another year?\n\nI've not put a timeframe to it but it will take its time."

The metal surged to its peak performance on Monday, trading at $117 per ounce amid geopolitical tension led by US President Donald Trump, and continued industrial demand.\n\nThe metal's futures price on MCX opened Wednesday's session at an all-time high of Rs 3,80,200, representing a 4.98 percent gain from its previous close. Silver previously hit a record high of Rs 3,69,000 on January 27, 2026.\n\nThe Indian Bullion Jewellers Association (IBJA) pegged the silver price at Rs 3,44,564 in its 18:30 rate session on January 27,  which is an 8.45 percent gain from the previous price at Rs 3,17,705 per kilogram.\n\nSilver rates across India’s major cities showed remarkable uniformity, with only marginal differences due to local taxes, jeweller margins, and logistics costs.\n\nHere is how a kilogram of silver has moved.\n\nOutlook: Will silver continue its momentum\n\nRenewed geopolitical tensions have been a key trigger. The US President Donald Trump announced a 100 percent tariff threat on Canada over a potential trade deal with China and raised tariffs on South Korean autos, pharmaceuticals, and lumber to 25 percent. These developments have reinforced safe-haven demand.\n\nThe Augmont Bullion report, published on January 28, noted that silver achieved $100 and $107 targets and may consolidate before resuming higher towards $120 (Rs 3,90,000). Key support is seen at $103 (Rs 3,40,000); a break could lead to retracement towards $100 and $97.\n\n\"For precious metals this year, the dominant driver has been policy uncertainty under Trump. A fresh wave of first-time investors, especially across Asia and Europe, is aggressively building personal holdings of gold and silver, adding structural support to prices,\" the report states."

        "full_content": "Mithun Sacheti, founder and former chief executive of CaratLane, is exploring a full acquisition of Orra Fine Jewellery, as he looks to re-enter the sector that delivered one of the biggest exits in India’s consumer space, people aware of the matter toldMoneycontrol.\n\nWho is Sacheti and what is his connection with the jewellery industry?\n\nSacheti has been in the jewellery industry for over 25 years, first with his family business, Jaipur Gems, and later with CaratLane. In 2023,Sacheti struck gold when he sold CaratLane to Titan in a near-$2 billion deal, one of the largest liquidity events in India’s consumer ecosystem.\n\nHe has been an angel investor and has backed VIP Industries, Ippopay, Bombay Shirt Company, Oro Safe and Nazara Technologies among others. Sacheti is also a general partner and co-sponsor at Singularity Growth, a venture capital firm, and a limited partner in Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal's 021 Capital.\n\nHow will Sacheti and Orra deal look like?\n\nSacheti is now returning to the jewellery industry and is looking to repeat the success he had in the past. This time, Sacheti is likely to team up with Plutus Wealth Management, a boutique proprietary investment firm, to take full control of Orra, sources said.\n\nHow are Sacheti and Plutus Wealth Management related?\n\nPlutus, like Sacheti, is an active investor in Indian companies. The wealth management firm has backed Happiest Minds, RateGain, CredAble and other businesses in India.\n\nPlutus’ Managing Partner and co-founder Arpit Khandelwal and Sacheti have worked together in the past and jointly invested in Nazara Technologies, a gaming and sports media developer.\n\nOrra will now be their next big bet together.\n\nHow much money Sacheti and Plutus will put in together, how it will be split and how much equity each will hold was not immediately clear.\n\nSacheti, Orra and Plutus Wealth did not reply to Moneycontrol’s queries.\n\nWhat is Orra Fine Jewellery and what valuation is it commanding?\n\nOrra Fine Jewellery is a Mumbai-based traditional jewellery business. It clocked a revenue of Rs 1,241 crore and a profit of Rs 6.4 crore in FY25, according to Tracxn, a private markets data provider. In FY24, it had revenues of Rs 1,156 crore and incurred a loss of Rs 11.3 crore.\n\nA business like Orra would be worth four to  six times its revenue, which would roughly translate to a valuation of about Rs 4,900-7,500 crore ($540-830 million), rough estimates by two industry executives say.\n\nIt has about 100 retail stores and plans to scale up under Sacheti’s leadership.\n\n“Mithun has charted plans to scale Orra’s revenues to about Rs 8,000-10,000 crore in 4-5 years from now,” one of the persons cited above told Moneycontrol.\n\nAre there legal hurdles in the way of Sacheti operating a jewellery brand?\n\nSacheti's legal binding ended a few months ago and he is free to operate in the space again.\n\nIn an interview to Moneycontrol in 2023, Sacheti had indicated he would consider running a similar business once his non-compete clause ends. While he had not commented on the specifics back then, he said a non-compete clause which prohibits the founder from starting up again for more than 24 months is “criminal”."

The respondents are representatives of companies across three categories - very large corporates (above Rs 3000 crore); large corporate company (Rs 500 crore to Rs 3000 crore) and MSMEs (Rs 500 crore and below).\n\nOn January 22,Moneycontrolpoll of 14 economists, bank treasury heads and fund managers has found that the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is likely to maintain the status quo on interest rates in its February policy review.\n\nThe rate-setting panel is likely to draw comfort from the higher growth and inflation averaging around the medium-term target of 4 percent, the majority of experts said.\n\nHowever, few experts believe that the central bank will cut rates by 25 basis points (Bps) in the upcoming monetary policy.\n\nThe MPC is to meet from February 4 and February 6 for its bi-monthly policy review.\n\nSince February, 2025, the MPC has reduced the repo rate by 125 bps to aid growth, with a 25 bps cut each in February and April, 50 bps in June, and 25 bps in December. However, the RBI has kept repo rate unchanged in August and October monetary policy.\n\nThe central bank will stick to its “neutral” stance and keep its tone dovish in the upcoming policy, experts said. This tone is targeted at lowering interest rates to increase spending and lending, as well as giving a boost to growth."

        "full_content": "Indian Inc is somewhat confident that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will be able to control inflation at the medium-term target of 4 percent, a Moneycontrol-Deloitte Survey of 45 chief executive officers (CEOs) has found.\n\nAccording to the survey, 47.85 percent are somewhat confident, while 15.22 percent are very confident on the central bank controlling inflation at 4 percent.\n\nThe RBI targets an inflation rate of 4 percent, with 6 percent and 2 percent as the upper and lower tolerance bands.\n\nThe Moneycontrol- Deloitte CXO survey was conducted byMoneycontroland Deloitte between December 2025 and January 2026.\n\nThe survey includes CXOs from across industries, such as banking and insurance; manufacturing; transport and logistics; energy; life sciences and health; telecom and tech and e-commerce. The respondents are representatives of companies across three categories - very large corporates (above Rs 3000 crore); large corporate company (Rs 500 crore to Rs 3000 crore) and MSMEs (Rs 500 crore and below).\n\nA relatively smaller percent and remaining CEOs surveyed fell in the \"somewhat concerned\" and \"very concerned\" brackets.\n\nIn December monetary policy, the central bank has revised inflation projection for FY26 to 2 percent from 2.6 percent projected earlier. The Q3 inflation projection was at 0.6 percent as compared to 1.8 percent earlier, and Q4 projected at 2.9 percent as compared to 4.0 percent earlier, and retail inflation for Q1 of the next fiscal is seen at 3.9 percent as compared to 4.5 percent projected earlier, and RBI projects Jul-Sept FY27 CPI inflation at 4%.\n\nOn January 22,Moneycontrolpoll of 14 economists, bank treasury heads and fund managers on RBI policy expectation on rate action in February has found that experts remained divided view on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation projections. This is because, few experts said the central bank may remain in wait and watch mode before revising inflation forecast ahead of the new base year series for GDP and CPI.\n\nIndia’s inflation firmed up in December, rising to a three-month high of 1.33 percent from 0.7 percent in November, government data released on January 12 showed.\n\nEven with the uptick, headline inflation has now stayed below the RBI’s lower tolerance threshold of 2 percent for four consecutive months, underlining how price pressures have cooled meaningfully since the middle of the year.\n\nFor the year as a whole, inflation averaged about 2.2 percent in 2025, making it one of the lowest readings seen in over a decade, helped largely by a sharp easing in food prices.\n\nDecember also marks a transition point for India’s inflation statistics. It is the final consumer price index (CPI) reading under the 2012 base year. Starting with the January print — due on February 12 — the CPI series will shift to a new 2024 base, with an updated consumption basket that includes more items and assigns a higher weight to non-food components.\n\nThe change is significant because the current CPI is heavily food-weighted, with food accounting for more than half of the index. This makes headline inflation highly volatile, as sharp swings in vegetables, cereals or pulses can move the overall number even when non-food prices remain stable."

        "full_content": "The impact of the GST-driven input tax credit (ITC) loss on life insurers seems to be playing out most sharply in the bancassurance channel during Q3 FY26 for both HDFC Life and ICICI Prudential Life, where parent banks continue to account for a large share of new business.\n\nAt HDFC Life, bancassurance contributes over 60 percent of annualised premium equivalent (APE), with HDFC Bank alone accounting for the bulk of that flow. At ICICI Prudential Life, bancassurance makes up around 25-30 percent of APE, with ICICI Bank contributing roughly half of the channel’s volumes.\n\nThis structural dependence may be a reflection of why negotiations around post-GST commercial realignment are not just with third-party distributors, but naturally and materially with parent banks, even as insurers expand agency, partnership and proprietary channels.\n\nGST reset hits banca-heavy insurers\n\nThe removal of input tax credit following the GST cut has forced insurers to revisit distributor economics, particularly in bancassurance where commissions are a significant cost line.\n\nHDFC Life said it has completed negotiations across distributors, including banks, and implemented revised commercial terms.\n\n“Short answer is negotiations were completed, and it’s moved on in terms of what we said that we would do,” MD & CEO Vibha Padalkar said during Q3 FY26 earnings call, adding that discussions with all distributors are now concluded and the company has transitioned to the new structure.\n\nSome of these measures were implemented mid-quarter after the GST announcement in late September. “You’ll see some part of it in Q3, with more flowing through in Q4 and progressively thereafter,” Padalkar said.\n\nHowever, queries sent to HDFC Life on the details of these negotiations remain unanswered until the time of publishing.\n\nICICI Prudential Life, however, said negotiations are still ongoing, reflecting the diversity of its partner base, including its parent bank.\n\n“We’ve got multiple types of partners, and our approach differs across them. Given this diversification, closing some of these commercials takes time,” MD & CEO Anup Bagchi said, during Q3 FY26 earnings call.\n\nThe insurer clarified that the ITC loss has already been absorbed. “Input tax credit is no longer available and that cost has been taken on the P&L and VNB,” it said, adding that any benefit going forward would come through commission rationalisation rather than ITC reversals.\n\nParent banks key to growth, and the slowdown\n\nThe heavy reliance on parent banks also perhaps explains why bancassurance growth has lagged this year.\n\nAt HDFC Life, bancassurance growth for the nine-month period stood at just 2 percent, pulling overall growth below industry levels.\n\n“Yes, banca has seen lower growth this year,” Vibha Padalkar said, adding that the softness should be viewed in context. “If you look at the two-year CAGR, growth is reasonably strong, and we believe the channel will continue to deliver.”\n\nThe insurer expects growth to normalise in FY27 as bancassurance stabilises and proprietary channels scale up.\n\nAt ICICI Prudential Life, bancassurance grew 10.5 percent year-on-year in Q3 FY26, contributing 26.7 percent to APE, which is a relatively lower number compared to the previous quarters for the company, with ICICI Bank continuing to deliver steady volumes.\n\nValue over volume amid recalibration\n\nBoth insurers stressed that part of the slowdown was strategic, driven by a sharper focus on quality and value, especially given the high share of parent banks in distribution.\n\nHDFC Life said it selectively stepped back from certain non-par opportunities where pricing and quality thresholds were not met.\n\n“In some cases this quarter, we didn’t participate to the extent we could have because of the commercials and the quality of business we wanted,” management said.\n\nThe company said it is increasingly tracking counter share of value of new business (VNB) at key partners like HDFC Bank rather than chasing topline growth.\n\n“Our focus is on improving counter share of VNB, not just volumes,” management said.\n\nProtection gaining ground within banca\n\nDespite overall softness, protection business within bancassurance is showing strong traction — particularly important given banks’ dominance in distribution.\n\nAt HDFC Life, protection growth in the banca channel exceeded 40 percent in Q3, though management cautioned that the impact is muted at the headline level due to lower ticket sizes versus savings products.\n\n“You need to sell about 2.5 protection policies to equal one savings policy in banca,” Padalkar said.\n\nICICI Prudential Life also reported strong protection momentum across channels, including ICICI Bank, while noting that ULIP sales remain sensitive to market conditions.\n\nHDFC Life expects Q4 to build on recent momentum, with growth supported by protection and steady savings demand. ICICI Prudential Life said it exited Q3 on a positive trajectory and expects momentum to continue, aided by diversified distribution and ongoing regulatory reforms."

        "full_content": "Over the past decade, regulatory liberalisation, digital acceleration and heightened financial awareness have combined to contribute to the consistent growth visible in India’s insurance sector.\n\nInvestments have quadrupled, and total premium growth has gone up from Rs 7.6 lakh crore in FY20 to Rs 11.9 lakh crore in FY25, per the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India’s (IRDAI) annual reports. The IRDAI has played a central role in this expansion through a series of phased structural reforms.\n\nFoundational measures such as the introduction of the “use and file” product regime in 2016 accelerated product innovation. More recent reforms include simplified licensing and registration norms notified in 2024 that reduces prior-approval requirements and the 2025 liberalisation of FDI to 100 percent, have materially eased market entry, capital access and enhanced operational flexibility for insurers. These measures, reinforced by inclusion-led initiatives such as the Bima Trinity and a calibrated move towards International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)-aligned reporting through Ind AS 117 have helped safeguard policyholder interests.\n\nIn parallel, IRDAI has articulated its intent to move towards a principle based risk-sensitive solvency framework-signalling a shift in supervisory philosophy, even as formal implementation timelines are yet to be announced. Despite this progress, the sector’s overall penetration in India remains modest, contributing to 3.7 percent of the country’s GDP, compared with a global average of over 7.3 percent, per IRDAI.\n\nThe protection gap, particularly in health, life and catastrophic events, remains substantial. Rapid digitalisation and the government’s “Insurance for All by 2047” vision are setting the stage for a broader inclusion drive, yet several operational and policy bottlenecks constrain faster adoption.\n\nAsk #1: Composite insurance licensing framework\n\nExpediting IRDAI’s composite licensing regime, which allows for life, non-life and health segments under a unified license, is essential. It will help optimise resource utilisation, reduce Expenses of Management (EoM), allow cross-sell opportunities and better overall risk management. As India moves forward, the framework should be complemented by clear prudential safeguards, including fund segregation and calibrated capital adequacy norms. Per an article by Global Business Law Review, it draws on global precedents such as Singapore and the Philippines to prevent cross-subsidisation and strengthen solvency discipline.\n\nAsk #2: Rationalisation of GST and Tax Benefits\n\nSpecific measures include exempting or providing a zero-rate GST on insurance agent commissions and allowing a full Input Tax Credit (ITC) on distribution expenses. Additionally, introducing enhanced deductions for term and health insurance under Section 80D, or ideally a new section altogether for all insurance premium-related benefits across life, general, and other types, would be helpful.\n\nIt will lead to reduced operational costs, improved agent viability, potentially enhance coverage for policyholders and enhanced uptake of protection products.\n\nAsk #3: Risk-based capital framework\n\nIt is imperative to allow the capital requirement to be based on the company’s risk appetite. If a company wants to focus solely on micro-insurance and affordable products for rural and semiurban areas, it needs calibrated capital incentives and corporate rebates. India can mitigate emerging risks through talent development, InsurTech adoption and early-warning systems inspired by global models, such as the Philippines’ RBC 2 and South Africa’s risk-tiering, building a robust Risk-based Supervision (RBS) that ensures solvency and trust, key enablers of IRDAI’s “Insurance for All”2047 vision.\n\nIn addition to the expectations, here are a few policy recommendations for the upcoming Union Budget:\n\nRecommendation #1: Incentivise climate and parametric insurance\n\nEstablish a sovereign reinsurance backstop or co-funding guarantee for pilot schemes in climate-linked or parametric insurance, covering weather and disaster risks. This move may de-risk insurers entering new lines, reduce the fiscal burden on post-disaster relief and enhance resilience in the agricultural and coastal sectors.\n\nRecommendation #2: Lower entry barriers for new and niche insurers\n\nIntroduce a tiered capital requirement regime for micro and digital-only insurers and offer transitional capital subsidies to new entrants. This will increase competition, drive product innovation and provide targeted insurance solutions for rural and emerging risk categories.\n\nRecommendation #3: Promote data, tech and skill ecosystem development\n\nAllocate R&D incentives to insurers that adopt AI, IoT and alternative data for underwriting and fraud detection. Also, create a joint public–private Insurance Data Exchange Hub integrating IIB, Electronic Health Record (EHR) data and lifestyle datasets under a privacy-preserving architecture. Moreover, introduce scholarships and tax credits for core insurance ops, actuarial and analytics training programmes. These actions may strengthen the talent base, improve risk pricing, increase consumer trust and create a globally competitive InsurTech landscape.\n\nRecommendation #4: Health claims oversight and pricing transparency\n\nEmpower IRDAI to have an oversight on hospital pricing and integrate the National Health Claims Exchange (NHCX) with direct audit trails. Push the insurance companies and hospitals to do a faster settlement, introduce penalties if needed. Overall, continue the faster claims settlement drive and build trust and transparency in the system. This will certainly enhance policyholders experience and trust in the system. Also, it might lead to a reduction in medical inflation, sustainable health insurance premiums and greater transparency in the claim’s ecosystem."

        "full_content": "Several payment platforms including RedGiraffe, PayZapp and NoBroker have resumed or continued to facilitate rent payments through credit cards after tweaking their processes to meet regulatory concerns, even as IPO-bound PhonePe has kept the service discontinued, people familiar with the matter told Moneycontrol.\n\nPhonePe had shut down rent payments and education fees last year after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) flagged concerns around misuse of credit cards for person-to-person transactions.\n\nIn its updated draft red herring prospectus (UDRHP), the Walmart-owned company disclosed that it suffered a revenue hit of around Rs 1,250 crore after exiting the rent payments business.\n\nMoneycontrol had earlier exclusively reported that PhonePe, Paytm and Cred had stopped rent payments on their platforms following regulatory scrutiny.\n\nNow, some players have quietly restarted the service after back-channel discussions with the banking regulator, according to four different sources.\n\n“These companies brought the feature back after strengthening end-user and end-usage verification. This includes collecting PAN cards of both the payer and the payee, along with rent agreement documents,” one of the sources said.\n\nThe issue stems from the nature of credit cards, which are designed primarily for person-to-merchant transactions.\n\nPhonePe and NoBroker did not respond to Moneycontrol's queries.\n\nFor rent payments to qualify, landlords effectively need to be treated as merchants, which brings them under stricter merchant KYC norms. The RBI was concerned that routine person-to-person transfers were being routed through credit cards by being presented as rent, creating regulatory and compliance risks.\n\nMost landlords are individuals, although those with current accounts are easier for payment platforms to onboard. At the same time, banks have grown wary of the segment because rent payments are typically high-value transactions.\n\nNearly 18 months ago, most banks removed rewards and cashbacks on rent payments as the cost of subsidising such transactions became unsustainable.\n\nDiscussions around rent payments also came up during the ongoing payment aggregator licensing process, according to industry executives.\n\nPayment firms argued that credit card payments to individuals are becoming more common as corporates increasingly work with freelancers, consultants, content creators and other independent professionals.\n\n“Stopping all payments to individuals through credit cards could disrupt a large and growing segment. With declarations, PAN-based monitoring and proper end-user verification, these transactions can still be tracked and scrutinised,” said a senior executive at a payments firm.\n\nPhonePe has chosen a different path.\n\nDespite rent payments being a meaningful revenue stream earlier, the company is prioritising regulatory certainty in a year when it is preparing for an IPO.\n\n“After what happened with Paytm, companies are far more conscious of regulatory costs. RBI has never explicitly said that rent payments through credit cards are fully permissible. It remains a grey area and is still under scrutiny,” said the CEO of a payment infrastructure firm that works closely with large banks.\n\nThe executive added that some credit card-issuing banks have independently stopped supporting rent payments, even without any formal directive from the RBI, signalling that discomfort around the segment persists despite the quiet comeback by some payment platforms."

        "full_content": "Vaibhav Sanghavi, CEO, ASK Hedge Solutions\n\nAs India enters a new fiscal year, markets are likely to reward a Budget that preserves macro stability while accelerating the next leg of private-capex and productivity-led growth. The policy challenge is to sustain high trend growth without re-opening the fiscal spigot, especially when global rates, geopolitics and supply chains remain uncertain. India’s recent fiscal strategy has been broadly credible: the Centre has reiterated a consolidation path, with the fiscal deficit targeted at 4.4 percent of GDP for FY26 and a stated intent to keep the glidepath intact.\n\n1) Fiscal prudence remains the market’s anchor\n\nBond markets care less about headline announcements and more about the durability of consolidation. The FY26 deficit target (4.4 percent) and the broader FRBM-aligned roadmap signal continued discipline, which should help contain term premia and crowd-in private credit over time. A prudence-first approach is also consistent with sustaining India’s capex push without destabilising debt dynamics, particularly as interest payments already form a meaningful share of expenditure.\n\n2) Manufacturing support is key\n\nIf India’s \"Viksit Bharat\" ambition is to be job-rich (not just GDP-rich), manufacturing has to do more heavy lifting. The PLI architecture has begun shifting the export mix toward higher value-added categories and enabling scale. Government-reported outcomes indicate ~₹1.61 lakh crore investment, ~₹14 lakh crore production/sales, exports exceeding ~₹5.31 lakh crore, and employment impact of over ~11.5 lakh (direct + indirect) under PLI implementation progress. A pro-manufacturing Budget should therefore prioritize logistics, industrial clusters, power reliability, and trade facilitation—so that incentives translate into globally competitive cost curves.\n\n3) India needs 'humongous' capital for 2047 — reviving FDI/FPI is essential\n\nA credible development aspiration requires an investment step-up. The World Bank estimates India would need to raise the investment rate from ~33.5% of GDP to ~40% by 2035, alongside reforms that deepen integration with global markets, to plausibly reach high-income status by 2047. In that context, policies that unequivocally improve the ease of FDI/FPI—stable rules, faster approvals, predictable taxation, and frictionless repatriation—become macro-critical. Recent data show gross FDI inflows of USD 81.04 bn in FY25 (+14% YoY), with manufacturing FDI also rising, underscoring the payoff from investor-friendly policy clarity. Every progressive country in the world wants to attract capital for growth, and we are competing within the same capital pool. Thus, our taxation policies and ease of access should not only be alike but also best in class. We need a much more practical approach, which our current Government is very capable of.\n\n4) Tax reforms: a strong start but the real prize is a wider base\n\nIndia’s tax capacity improves most sustainably when compliance rises, and the base broadens. GST is a good example, reflecting formalisation and better compliance. Continued rate rationalisation, fewer exemptions, and simpler dispute resolution can further reduce compliance costs—helping widen the base and focusing on reducing rates.\n\n5) Strategic divestments: unlock resources and improve price discovery\n\nWith India’s capex needs large and persistent, strategic divestments can be a non-distortionary way to raise resources while improving efficiency. Budget documents and commentary suggest the government continues to budget “miscellaneous capital receipts” (including disinvestment/asset monetisation) rather than setting a single headline disinvestment number—yet the market would welcome a clear, time-bound pipeline and execution cadence. A mission-mode approach—especially in assets where private management improves outcomes—can enhance valuation realisation and credibility simultaneously.\n\n6) 'Out-of-the-box' metric: target business growth, not only tax growth\n\nBudgets often set tax-revenue growth “asks” for the revenue department. A more growth-maximising framing would be to set measurable targets for industry expansion, formal employment creation, and investment growth—because a larger economic pie typically delivers stronger, more durable tax buoyancy. The sharp rise in GST collections over time already illustrates how formalisation and growth can lift revenues without excessive rate pressure.\n\n7) AI as the next UPI moment: indigenous LLMs and the compute stack\n\nAI is rapidly becoming “general-purpose infrastructure.” India has begun building the rails: the Cabinet-approved IndiaAI Mission (outlay ₹10,371.92 crore over five years) explicitly includes compute capacity (10,000+ GPUs via PPP), datasets, and the development of indigenous foundational/large multimodal models. Follow-through matters—especially investments across data centres, GPUs/accelerators, and hardware supply chains—so India can avoid strategic dependence while enabling domestic productivity gains across sectors.\n\nA pro-business, pro-growth, pro-reform Budget—anchored in fiscal prudence, manufacturing scale, frictionless capital flows, continued tax-base widening, credible divestment execution, and mission-mode AI infrastructure—would likely be welcomed by both equities and bonds. Fiscal credibility lowers the cost of capital; reforms lift the return on capital. That combination is the most durable “market expectation” India can offer."

DXC Tech could be looking for cheaper options after it sold its Electronic City campus, sources said.\n\nPrestige Lakeshore Drive, located next to the Bellandur Lake, will house the new campus of the US-based firm, which employs over 20,000 people in Bengaluru. However, several employees have raised concerns over poor accessibility to the under-construction tech park, flagging commuting challenges.\n\nIt may be recalled that real estate developer Sattva Group acquired DXC Technology’s 20-acre Electronics City campus for around Rs 400 crore.\n\nSeparately, global investment firm Blackstone has leased approximately 4.5 lakh sq ft of premium office space at Prestige Lakeshore Drive.\n\nDXC Technology had not responded to Moneycontrol's queries at the time of publishing.\n\nORR shifts amid infra concerns\n\nThe move comes at a time when several companies along the traffic-clogged Central Silk Board-KR Pura stretch are reportedly exploring relocation options. Areas such as Whitefield, now connected by the Purple Line Metro and North Bengaluru near Kempegowda International Airport are emerging as preferred alternatives due to better connectivity.\n\nAlso read:Crumbling Outer Ring Road pushes more startups, firms towards North Bengaluru, Whitefield\n\nThe ORR Metro corridor, part of the Blue Line connecting Central Silk Board to KR Pura, is slated for completion by December 2026. However, given the city’s track record of infrastructure delays, industry watchers remain sceptical about the timeline.\n\nDespite being the nerve centre of Bengaluru’s technology sector, ORR continues to face persistent infrastructure challenges, including narrow and damaged roads, severe traffic congestion, water shortages, and flooding during monsoons. According to the Outer Ring Road Companies Association (ORRCA), IT firms along the ORR contribute nearly $22 billion, or about 32 percent of Bengaluru’s total IT revenue.\n\nAlso read:Bengaluru losing GCC edge to Hyderabad, tier 2 cities due to infra woes\n\nBengaluru-based food delivery platformSwiggy has also moved its corporate headquartersfrom Embassy Tech Village in Bellandur on ORR to Sumadhura Capitol Towers in Whitefield.\n\nLogistics platformBlackBuck has also announced its exit from the ORR corridor, citing poor infrastructure.\n\nIn a social media post on September 16, chief executive Rajesh Yabaji said the company was relocating to improve employee commute, triggering widespread debate over Bengaluru’s infrastructure challenges and even drawing an invitation from Andhra Pradesh IT minister NaraLokesh to shift operations to Visakhapatnam.\n\nYabaji later saidBlackBuck would continue to operate from Bengaluru, with plans to split operations between Whitefield and Koramangala.\n\nAlso read:BlackBuck CEO’s post on Bengaluru’s crumbling Outer Ring Road jolts Karnataka into action\n\nPrestige’s pitch for Lakeshore Drive\n\nPrestige Group CEO and executive director (Office) Juggy Marwaha recently wrote on LinkedIn that Prestige Lakeshore Drive reflects the evolution of Bengaluru’s technology ecosystem.\n\nHe said the campus, developed on what was once challenging marshy land, has now emerged as a landmark workplace destination, backed byPrestige Group chairman Irfan Razack and global investment firm Blackstone.\n\n“Today, three global technology MNCs have validated that vision. They committed long before its potential was visible, and today they don’t merely occupy space here - they call it home,” Marwaha wrote.\n\nHe added that Prestige is developing seamless flyover access to the campus at its own cost and on its own land. Future plans include direct metro connectivity, e-bus integration, and a proposed Greater Bengaluru Authority-PPP project to transform Lakeshore Drive into a boulevard-style urban corridor.\n\nOn the ground at Prestige Lakeshore Drive, the campus is still very much a work in progress.\n\nAs of last week, construction workers were engaged in basic infrastructure activity on the sixth floor, including drilling for electrical wiring, putty work, and moving ventilation equipment.\n\nWhile the building appears largely done, interior and services-related work remains pending."

        "full_content": "Gold price stood at $5,071 per ounce on January 27 (4:10 am GMT), down 0.20% from the previous close. The yellow metal breached the $5,000 mark for the first time on Monday and continues to hover near record highs, supported by geopolitical tensions and optimism over potential US Federal Reserve rate cuts.\n\nOn MCX, the domestic futures price opened today's session at Rs 1,58,551 per 10 grams of 24 carat purity, and continued to trade flat at Rs 1,58,347 (9:47 am IST), representing 1.48 percent gain from its previous close at Rs 1,56,037. The metal reached its peak at Rs 1,59,226 on MCX on January 23, 2026.\n\nThe gold price has surged amid fresh tensions between the US and NATO over Greenland. The ongoing crisis in Ukraine and Gaza, and the US capture of the Venezuelan President, have also kept the price of gold high. On Saturday, the US President threatened a 100 percent tariff on Canada if it strikes a trade deal with China.\n\nGold prices vary by purity. Check the prices of gold based on its purity:\n\nCity-wise gold prices in India today\n\nGold rates across India’s major cities showed remarkable uniformity, with only marginal differences due to local taxes, jeweller margins, and logistics costs.\n\nOutlook: Will gold continue its momentum?\n\n“Gold once again touched fresh all-time highs. The ongoing US-led geopolitical uncertainty around trade tariffs, Venezuela, Greenland, and rising debt concerns continues to keep safe-haven demand elevated. As long as gold holds Rs 1,50,000, the momentum remains intact, and prices could extend towards Rs 1,65,000 in the coming sessions,\" said Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities."

        "full_content": "The shares ofHindustan Zincjumped around 5 percent on January 27 as silver prices extended their record bull run, rushing to fresh lifetime highs. Silver ETFs also mirrored the sharp surge in the precious metals.\n\nHindustan Zinc shares hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 733 apiece in the early trading hours of Tuesday. The Vedanta Group-company is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity.\n\nSilver prices soar to fresh lifetime highs:\n\nSilver futures on MCX with March expiry jumped more than 7 percent to hit a fresh lifetime high of Rs 3,59,800 per kilogram. The future contracts with May and July expiries also surged to new all-time highs of Rs 3,75,261 per kg and Rs 3,82,940 per kg, respectively.\n\nSpot silver surged 5.2 percent to $109.22 an ounce, after hitting a record high of $117.69 ​on Monday. The white metal has already surged 53% ‍so far this year. \"Trump's disruptive policy approach this year is playing into the hands of ​precious metals as a defensive play. The threats of higher tariffs to Canada and South Korea are doing enough to keep gold a safe-haven choice,\" said Reuters quoted Tim Waterer, KCM Trade's chief market ‍analyst, as saying.\n\nUS President Donald Trump on Monday said he would raise tariffs on South Korean autos, lumber, and pharmaceuticals imports to 25 percent, criticizing Seoul for failing to enact a trade deal with Washington.\n\nThis came after he threatened tariffs on Canada. The tariff flip-flops have significantly boosted the precious metals.\n\nSilver exchange traded funds (ETFs) saw significant surge today, as the precious and industrial metal soared.Nippon India Silver ETF(Silverbees) jumped nearly 10 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 321.48 apiece. Groww Silver ETF also gained around 10 percent.\n\nZerodha Silver ETFgained more than 11 percent to a new record high of Rs 34.7 apiece.HDFC Silver ETFmeanwhile surged more than 12 percent.\n\nUTI Silver ETF, Aditya Birla Sun Life Silver ETF,Tata Silver ETF, ICICI Pru Silver ETF, DSP Silver ETF, Motilal Oswal Silver ETF, Axis Silver ETF and others also gained sharply.\n\nShould you buy silver ETFs at these levels?\n\nFor those looking at fresh investment, the main risk right now is valuation and sentiment, said Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead at VT Markets. He added that silver is far more volatile than gold, and sharp rallies are often followed by equally sharp corrections once speculative interest cools.\n\n\"Entering at current highs could expose new investors to near-term drawdowns if prices consolidate or retrace sharply. A better approach for those who still want exposure is to use dollar cost averaging strategies, entering in small, staggered allocations that average out entry costs and reduce timing risk,\" he said.\n\nFor investors planning to exit their positions, Maxwell said that if silver was added as a tactical hedge or short-term trade, then this is a sensible area to book at least partial profits. \"Locking in gains and rebalancing back to target asset allocation helps protect against sudden reversals, which are common in precious metals,\" he said.\n\nHowever, investors with a longer-term view who believe in structural drivers like industrial demand and tight supply may choose to continue holding a core position, the expert added. \"This is not an ideal price for large fresh investments, and partial profit-taking for current holders is a rational risk-management move rather than a full exit,\" he explained.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here."

        "full_content": "Gold rose, holding above $5,000 an ounce for a second day, as a weak dollar helped to extend a rally fueled by geopolitical risks and investor flight from sovereign bonds and currencies.\n\nBullion jumped as much as 1.1% early on Tuesday, its seventh straight day of gains. A gauge of the dollar fell to the lowest in nearly four years during the previous session, making gold more affordable for most buyers, while US President Donald Trump threatened to hike tariffs on South Korean goods to 25%.\n\nGold’s dramatic rally – the metal has more than doubled over the last two years – drives home bullion’s historic role as a gauge of fear in markets. Fresh from its best annual performance since 1979, it’s gained a further 17% so far this year due largely to the so-called debasement trade, whereby investors retreat from currencies and Treasuries. A massive selloff in the Japanese bond market is the latest example of investors rejecting heavy fiscal spending.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Trump administration’s actions — attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve, threats to annex Greenland, military intervention in Venezuela — have also shaken markets. The US leader’s warning to South Korea follows a threat to Canada over the weekend to impose 100% tariffs if Ottawa makes a trade deal with China.\n\nOptions traders are betting gold will rally further as investors diversify from American assets. Implied volatility of Comex gold futures climbed to the highest since the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, while volatility on State Street’s SPDR Gold Shares — the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund — has also broken out higher.\n\nLooking ahead, investors will also be keeping a close tab on the Federal Reserve’s actions on Wednesday, with the US central bank widely expected to halt its rate-cutting cycle as a steadier jobs market restores a degree of consensus after months of growing division.\n\nGold rose 0.9% to $5,051.50 an ounce as of 8:15 a.m. in Singapore. Silver advanced 3.6% to $107.49 an ounce, having hit an all-time high above $117.71 in the previous session before retreating. Platinum and palladium climbed, while the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was flat after falling 0.4% in the previous session."

        "full_content": "Even as the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has been setting new records for transaction volume and value every month, with an annual growth rate of around 30 percent, the industry is expecting a higher subsidy for the ecosystem in the 2026 Union Budget.\n\nThe Payments Council of India and other payment companies have requested a higher subsidy for UPI from the finance ministry this year, according to three separate sources.\n\nDigital transactions carry what is called a merchant discount rate (MDR), a fee that banks collect from merchants at the point of sale for facilitating digital payments. UPI MDR was 30 basis points before the government waived it in 2020. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.\n\nTo promote the adoption of digital payments, the government mandated that UPI transactions remain free for users, and in return, it will compensate payment firms for the costs they bear to facilitate them.\n\n“Since there has been no announcement on MDR since the subsidy allocation, we would like to have a higher subsidy than was announced last year. But we are not sure what the government is planning. But for UPI to reach rural areas and new segments of population, MDR is essential,” said a senior executive with a payments firm that has been part of the process to reach out to the finance ministry\n\nHowever, last year, the central government announced Rs 1,500 crore as a subsidy for UPI transactions at merchants, as against the industry expectation of around Rs 5,000 crore.\n\nIn 2024, the government subsidy for UPI was Rs 3,500 crore. As per the government policy, it provides 15 basis points (bps) of subsidy for UPI transactions below Rs 2,000.\n\nIn 2025, the likely subsidy bill would have been around Rs 6,000 crore, indicating a shortfall of Rs 4,500 crore in FY 2025.\n\nUPI is the country’s most popular digital payment method, facilitating around 85 percent of all online transactions. The platform run by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) sees over 21.5 billion transactions in a month, worth over Rs 28 lakh crore.\n\n“The budget is a significant contributor to the continuity of UPI transactions being supported by zero MDR, in particular, for small-value merchant-to-client payments (M2C) for amounts up to Rs 2,000,” said Rohit Mahajan, founder and managing partner of PlutosOne, a technology infrastructure firm that works with payment firms.\n\nWith UPI becoming the primary option for conducting financial transactions, it is essential for both merchants and the industry to benefit from MDR subsidies, Mahajan said, adding, “For the payment firms to continue to develop in the direction of financial inclusion and support innovation in the next stage of India’s digital finance evolution, this needs to be addressed.”\n\nPCI, which represents payment and fintech companies, has requested the reintroduction of 30bps or 0.3 percent as MDR on UPI payments for large merchants. Large merchants are those with a turnover of over Rs 40 lakh annually.\n\nIt also demanded that the government consider MDR for all Rupay Debit card transactions, which aligns with the existing MDR structure for credit cards (around 2 percent) and for non-Rupay debit cards (around 0.75-0.9%)."

        "full_content": "Banking operations at public sector banks across the country are likely to be disrupted on Tuesday as the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) goes ahead with its nationwide strike on January 27, pressing for the immediate implementation of a five-day work week.\n\nThe strike call comes after a conciliation meeting held on January 23 with the Chief Labour Commissioner failed to break the deadlock. UFBU is an umbrella body of nine unions representing officers and employees of public sector banks.\n\nWith banks already closed on Sunday (January 25) and Monday (January 26) on account of Republic Day, customers could face disruption in branch-level services for three consecutive days.\n\n“Despite detailed discussions during the conciliation proceedings, there was no assurance on our demand. Hence, we have been compelled to proceed with the strike action,” All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) General Secretary C H Venkatachalam told PTI.\n\nAll India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC) General Secretary Rupam Roy said the move to declare all Saturdays as holidays was agreed upon between the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) and UFBU during the wage revision settlement in March 2024.\n\n“It is unfortunate that the government is not responding to our genuine demand. There would be no loss of man-hours as we have agreed to work an extra 40 minutes daily from Monday to Friday,” Roy said.\n\nNational Confederation of Bank Employees (NCBE) General Secretary L Chandrasekhar said the agitation was not directed against customers. “This movement is not against customers, but for a sustainable, humane, and efficient banking system. A rested banker serves the nation better. A balanced workforce strengthens financial stability. 5-Day banking is not a luxury; it is an economic and human necessity,” he said.\n\nBranch-level services such as cash deposits and withdrawals, cheque clearances and administrative work are expected to be affected at public sector banks, including State Bank of India (SBI), Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Bank of Baroda.\n\nPrivate sector lenders such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are expected to remain largely unaffected, as their employees are not part of the unions participating in the strike.\n\nDigital banking services, including UPI and internet banking, are expected to function normally, though ATM cash availability could face localised disruptions due to logistical issues.\n\nSeveral public sector banks, including SBI, have informed stock exchanges about the possible impact. “While the bank has made necessary arrangements to ensure normal functioning in its branches and offices on the day of strike, it is likely that work in the bank may be impacted by the strike,” SBI said in a regulatory filing.\n\nThe unions are demanding the declaration of all Saturdays as holidays, a proposal that was part of the 12th Bipartite Settlement signed with the IBA in March 2024 but is yet to receive government notification. Currently, banks operate on the first, third and fifth Saturdays of every month."

        "full_content": "Analysts expect spot gold prices, which hit a record high above $5,000 per ounce on Monday, to climb further toward $6,000 this year on mounting global tensions as well as strong central-bank and retail demand.\n\nGold raced to a peak of $5,092.70 as geopolitical and economic risks rattled markets. The safe-haven metal is up more than 17% this year, after soaring 64% in 2025.\n\nThe London Bullion Market Association's annual precious metals forecast survey shows analysts projecting gold rising as high as $7,150 and averaging $4,742 in 2026.\n\nGoldman Sachs has raised its December 2026 gold price forecast to $5,400 from $4,900.\n\nIndependent analyst Ross Norman expects a high of $6,400 this year, with an average of $5,375.\n\n\"The only certainty at the moment seems to be uncertainty, and that's playing very much into gold's hands,\" Norman said.\n\nGold's recent rally has been fuelled by geopolitical tensions, from the U.S.–NATO friction over Greenland and tariff uncertainty to rising doubts over the independence of the U.S. Federal Reserve, among others.\n\n\"With the upcoming U.S. mid-term elections, political uncertainty may increase further. At the same time, persistent concerns about over-valued equity markets are likely to reinforce portfolio diversification flows into gold,\" said Philip Newman, a director at Metals Focus. [MKTS/GLOB]\n\n\"After crossing the $5,000/ounce milestone, we expect further upside,\" he added.\n\nCentral-bank gold buying, a key driver of prices in 2025, is expected to stay strong this year.\n\nGoldman Sachs forecasts purchases to average 60 metric tons a month as emerging-market central banks continue diversifying reserves into gold.\n\nPoland's central bank, which held 550 tons of gold at end-2025, aims to lift reserves to 700 tons, Governor Adam Glapinski said this month.\n\nThese plans reaffirm the view that the key driver behind the spike in gold is central banks \"looking to de-dollarise ... and where else could you go except into gold?\" Norman said.\n\nChina's central bank extended its gold-buying spree for a 14th month in December.\n\nInflows into gold-backed ETFs, which store bullion for investors and account for a significant amount of investment demand for the metal, are also underpinning prices as markets expect further U.S. rate cuts this year.\n\n\"There's an opportunity cost to holding gold which has no yield. As interest rates decline, so does this opportunity cost. If the Fed continues to lower rates in 2026, demand for gold should rise,\" said Chris Mancini, co-portfolio manager of the Gabelli Gold Fund.\n\nGold ETFs saw record inflows in 2025, led by North American funds, according to World Gold Council data, with annual inflows surging to $89 billion. In tonnage terms, inflows totalled 801 metric tons, the highest since their record in 2020.\n\nGold demand for jewellery has weakened amid high prices, partly offset by a strong appetite for small bars and coins in key markets such as India.\n\nBar-and-coin buying is also evident in Europe, though some investors are taking profit, analysts said.\n\nFor many retail investors, gold's appeal lies in its simplicity, said Frederic Panizzutti, global head of sales at Numismatica Genevensis, which trades precious metals coins.\n\n\"You don't need to analyse a balance sheet, assess credit risk or worry about a country or sovereign risk,\" he said. \"Your only risk with physical gold is the price direction. And as geopolitics and geoeconomics have become more complicated ... that simplicity has become more attractive.\"\n\nAnalysts say several factors could trigger a correction, including a pullback in U.S. rate-cut expectations, margin calls in equities, and easing concerns about Fed independence.\n\nHowever, most expect any pullback to be short-lived and treated as a buying opportunity.\n\n\"A meaningful and sustained decline in gold would require a return to a more stable economic and geopolitical backdrop, which currently appears unlikely,\" Newman added."

The price hit the record Rs 1,58,899 per 10 grams on January 23, 2026.\n\nThe current rally has been driven by the likelihood of another rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, further lowering the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold.\n\nThe latest surge in gold prices improved in the aftermath of fresh tensions between the US and NATO over Greenland. The ongoing crisis in Ukraine and Gaza, and the US capture of the Venezuelan President, have also kept the price of gold high. On Saturday, the US President threatened a 100 percent tariff on Canada if it strikes a trade deal with China.\n\nMarket sentiment also improved with heightened expectations of monetary easing as Trump is expected to appoint the next Fed Chair, with markets pricing in a more dovish candidate.\n\nCommodity analysts now predict the price of yellow metal to hit $5,550 and up to $7,000 per ounce in the long term.\n\n\"Gold prices are trading at multi‑year highs, reflecting robust investor demand amid geopolitical and macro risks. In the short to mid term, gold is expected to climb another 10–20 percent, supported by persistent safe‑haven flows, continued central bank accumulation, and broad ETF inflows,” said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market, an online trading platform.\n\nRenisha Chainani, Head of Research at Augmont, also agrees that the price of gold in the short-to mid-term will likely remain firm with an upside bias. “Prices could move toward $5,500, with interim consolidation along the way.”\n\nCiting Fibonacci extension analysis, Apurva Sheth, Head of Market Research at Samco Securities, said that the next major target zone near $7,040 indicates further upside potential as the cycle progresses.\n\n“Looking ahead, while interim consolidations are natural after a strong run-up, the broader setup suggests gold remains well-positioned over the coming years. Overall, gold continues to behave as a reliable long-term portfolio anchor, rather than a short-term trade,” Sheth said.\n\nIndeed, with real yields still muted amid geopolitical uncertainties, gold is likely to stay on an upward path. A softer dollar, rising global debt, and continued central-bank buying should also keep the yellow metal well supported."

        "full_content": "As India approaches the Union Budget 2026, the clean energy transition stands at an inflection point. Budget 2025 laid important groundwork—doubling allocations for green hydrogen to ₹6,000 crores, launching the National Manufacturing Mission, and strengthening domestic supply chains. These measures have reinforced a powerful message: rapid decarbonisation can coexist with economic growth.\n\nThe results are visible. India’s non-fossil fuel capacity has crossed 260 GW, growing 22.6% year-on-year, with renewables now accounting for over 50% of the installed power mix. Yet, achieving 500 GW of renewable capacity by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2070 will require sustained and targeted fiscal support—especially for emerging segments where economics remain fragile.\n\nIn Budget 2026, three areas merit urgent attention.\n\nScaling-Up the Compressed Bio-Gas sector\n\nLaunched in 2018, the Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) initiative aimed to set up 5,000 compressed bio-gas (CBG) plants by 2023–24. While CBG blending obligations effective FY 2025–26 have revived momentum, progress remains uneven. Of over 1,100 registered plants, only about 160 are operational, and just 113 are currently selling gas.\n\nPolicy refinements—such as advance Central Financial Assistance (CFA), harmonisation under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, biomethane pipeline norms, and BIS methane purity standards—have improved the outlook. However, fiscal support has not kept pace with rising costs. Plant capex has increased from ₹4–5 crore per tonne per day (TPD) in 2021–22 to ₹6–7 crores per TPD today, yet CFA levels remain unchanged.\n\nCFA should be enhanced from ₹4 crores per 4.8 TPD to at least ₹6 crore per 4.8 TPD, without an upper cap.\n\nCurrent limits discourage larger projects, with plants above 12 TPD capped at ₹10 crore of support. A pro-rated CFA linked to actual capex—similar to the recent increase in viability gap funding for MSW-to-CBG plants—would encourage scale and attract long-term capital.\n\nEqually important is budgetary allocation. The initial ₹800 crore earmarked for Phase I (FY 2021–26) has been exhausted, and the additional ₹180 crore announced in September 2025 supports barely 10 plants. With over 1,000 plants expected to be commissioned by 2030,a cumulative allocation of around ₹10,000 crores is essential to unlock the sector’s potential.\n\nTo replicate ethanol’s success story, CBG economics must improve. While ethanol enjoys a premium of roughly 120% over fossil petrol, CBG trades at an 85% discount on an energy-equivalent basis. Supplementary revenues depend on market development assistance (MDA) for fermented organic manure and liquid fermented organic manure. Current allocations are inadequate to cover digestate processing costs.\n\nRevising MDA to ₹3–3.5 per kg for five years would stabilise unit economics during the scale-up phase.\n\nTaxation is another bottleneck. CBG plants face an inverted GST structure: output is taxed at 5%, while plant and machinery attract 12%, leading to blocked input tax credits and higher effective capex.\n\nAligning GST for CBG with wind and solar—where rates were rationalised to 5%—would significantly improve project viability.\n\nLeveraging carbon credit market\n\nFinally, carbon and renewable gas markets are approaching a turning point. The proposed Renewable Gas Certificate framework and forthcoming carbon credit trading system can provide additional revenue streams. AllowingCBG-linked certificates and carbon credits to be traded domestically and internationallyunder Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement would further strengthen project economics, especially as global carbon prices remain well above India’s current proposed floor.\n\nGreen Hydrogen: Building homegrown capability\n\nThe National Green Hydrogen Mission has gained momentum, but achieving the target of 5 million tonnes of annual production by 2030 will hinge on domestic electrolyser manufacturing.\n\nTargeted customs duty exemptionsfor patented components and materials not yet manufactured in India can reduce capital costs and accelerate localisation—an approach already adopted for critical minerals and lithium-ion battery components. In parallel, incentives for integrated renewable-hydrogen projects can improve economics by reducing transmission losses and creating clustered industrial ecosystems around hydrogen hubs.\n\nBattery Storage: Strengthening the renewable grid\n\nAs solar and wind capacity expands, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) will be critical to manage intermittency and ensure grid stability. However, fragmented GST rates across BESS components inflate project costs.A uniform 5% GST—aligned with other renewable infrastructure—would accelerate deployment.\n\nIn addition, the viability gap funding introduced for 4 GWh of storage in Budget 2023 should be extended to larger capacities. Scaling storage is essential if India is to reliably integrate 500 GW of renewables into the grid.\n\nBudget 2026 is an opportunity to convert ambition into execution. By addressing these structural and fiscal gaps, India can strengthen its clean-energy value chains, crowd in private investment, and reinforce its position as a global leader in the energy transition.\n\n(Ashish Bhandari is MD & CEO, Thermax.)\n\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication."

        "full_content": "Gold rose beyond $5,000 an ounce for the first time, extending a breakneck rally fueled by US President Donald Trump’s reshaping of international relations and investor flight from sovereign bonds and currencies.\n\nBullion climbed to around $5,040, having gained more than 8% last week as geopolitical risks and dollar weakness reinforced demand. A key gauge of the US currency posted its biggest weekly decline since May, making precious metals cheaper for most buyers. Silver also advanced to a record, having crossed $100 an ounce in the previous session.\n\nGold’s dramatic rally – the metal has more than doubled over the last two years – drives home bullion’s historic role as a gauge of fear in markets. Fresh from its best annual performance since 1979, it’s gained more than 15% so far this year due largely to the so-called debasement trade, whereby investors retreat from currencies and Treasuries. A massive selloff in the Japanese bond market last week is the latest example of investors rejecting heavy fiscal spending.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Trump administration’s actions — attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve, threats to annex Greenland, military intervention in Venezuela — have also spooked markets. For investors looking to navigate this uncertainty, the haven appeal of gold has rarely been more attractive.\n\n“Gold is the inverse of confidence,” said Max Belmont, a portfolio manager at First Eagle Investment Management. “It’s a hedge against unexpected bouts of inflation, unanticipated drawdowns in the market, flare-ups in geopolitical risk.”\n\nBeyond geopolitics, swelling public debt in advanced economies has become another key pillar of gold’s rally. Some long-term investors, convinced that inflation will become the only path to state solvency, have piled into gold as a way to preserve purchasing power.\n\n“People have become a lot more worried about the long-term debt trajectory over the past three years,” said John Reade, chief strategist at the World Gold Council. “The place that I have found the debasement and debt arguments come through the most has been with family offices. They’re thinking about generational wealth protection, rather than the short term.”\n\nThis debasement trade reached its zenith in late 2025, when prominent investors like Citadel Securities Chief Executive Officer Ken Griffin and Bridgewater Associates Founder Ray Dalio pointed to gold’s rise as a warning signal.\n\nInvestors are now waiting for Trump’s pick for the next Fed chair after the US president said he has finished interviewing candidates, reiterating that he has someone in mind for the job. A more dovish chair would increase bets on further interest-rate cuts this year — a positive for non-yielding bullion — after three successive reductions.\n\nGold rose 1% to $5,035.25 an ounce as of 8:12 a.m. in Singapore. Silver advanced 2.2% to $105.50. Platinum edged lower, having earlier hit a record high, while palladium climbed. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was down 0.2% after losing 1.6% last week."

        "full_content": "Silver delivered a strong performance between January 19 and January 22, posting double-digit gains and reaffirming its status as one of the better-performing commodities this cycle. Supported by firm industrial demand, persistent supply constraints, and its dual role as an industrial metal and monetary hedge, the move was fundamentally healthy rather than speculative. While short-term pauses are normal within an ongoing bull phase.\n\nA large section of investors who chose to participate through silver ETFs ended the period with returns that were materially lower than the performance of silver itself. Some even saw sharp drawdowns toward the end of the week, despite no comparable weakness in the commodity.\n\nThe First Signal: Price Moves That Didn’t Match the Asset\n\nThe above table compares daily price changes in MCX Silver with those of five major silver ETFs. The contrast is immediately visible. While MCX Silver posted strong cumulative gains over the period, ETF returns were uneven and, in aggregate, remained in single-digit.\n\nMore importantly, on the final day of the period (i.e., January 22), silver prices held firm while several ETFs corrected sharply. This is not a comment on volatility alone. It is a reflection of a deeper issue: the gap between asset performance and investor outcome.\n\nWhere the Gap Emerged: Trading Price vs True Value\n\nThe second table shows the premium or discount at which silver ETFs traded relative to their Net Asset Value.\n\nDuring the rally, several ETFs traded consistently at elevated premiums. In simple terms, investors were paying more than the value of the silver held by the fund. This excess did not represent higher silver prices. It represented pressure created by rapid buying and limited liquidity.\n\nAs buying intensity eased, prices gravitated back toward NAV. That adjustment reduced ETF prices even though silver prices remained resilient. The outcome felt like a loss, but it was not caused by silver. It was caused by how the entry was executed.\n\nHow Mispricing Turns Into Volatility\n\nThe third table captures intraday volatility, measured as the high-low range relative to the closing price. Here, the pattern becomes even clearer. Silver ETFs showed significantly wider intraday ranges compared with MCX Silver, particularly on the day premiums reversed. This isn’t accidental. Volatility rises when prices drift from value, even though the underlying asset remains stable.\n\nFor investors, the lesson is practical rather than theoretical.\n\n** Always compare the ETF market price with the indicative Net Asset Value (i-NAV) before buying.\n\n** Avoid entries when premiums stretch meaningfully above fair value.\n\n** Prefer staggered participation over urgency-driven buying.\n\nExpense ratios are predictable and gradual. Premiums are immediate and reversible. The difference between the two can decide whether a rally translates into wealth or frustration.\n\nETFs remain effective instruments when price discovery is orderly. When it is not, outcomes become uneven — even in rising markets. So, participating in a bull market is not only about choosing the right asset. It is also about ensuring that the chosen instrument allows the investor to actually receive the return the asset delivers.\n\nEpisodes like this highlight a structural gap in market design. When traded prices drift too far from the underlying value, volatility spikes, and outcomes increasingly disadvantage less-informed investors. Markets work best when price and NAV stay closely aligned, keeping volatility contained while allowing rallies to play out smoothly.\n\nFrom a regulatory standpoint, a few market-friendly measures could meaningfully improve outcomes:\n\n** Encourage tighter alignment between ETF market prices and i-NAV through clearer premium–discount tolerance bands. A clear realignment of circuit filters of ETFs and its underlying commodity (silver in this case) market should be looked into.\n\n** Introduce calibrated daily price range limits to prevent sharp, value-detached moves during periods of heavy flows.\n\n** Strengthen real-time i-NAV visibility to aid better price discovery for retail participants.\n\nSuch measures would be in line with the motto of the regulator: enhance stability, protect investors' interests, participation, and reinforce confidence without restricting access or innovation.\n\nSilver moved in the right direction this week. The difference lay in how efficiently that reward reached investors. Understanding the difference between market direction and market structure is no longer optional. It is essential. Because in modern markets, returns are earned not only by being right on the asset, but by choosing the right way to own it.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "full_content": "Markets were turbulent this week ended January 23, driven by Trump’s Greenland shifts, fears of a transatlantic trade war and renewed US–Iran tensions.\n\nThe Dollar Index slipped to 97.42, its lowest level since September 2025, amid heightened volatility and shifting geopolitical dynamics. President Trump’s tariff threats against Europe and renewed push to acquire Greenland unsettled investors. Trump warned of “big retaliation” if European countries were to sell US Treasury holdings in response to proposed tariffs targeting NATO partners, amid speculation that Europe could use US assets as leverage.\n\nMeanwhile, strong US economic data, including an upward revision to Q3 GDP to 4.4%, lower jobless claims, and steady PCE inflation, point to a reduced need for immediate policy easing. Still, US equities closed the choppy week with a second consecutive, albeit modest, weekly loss, as US–EU relations remained strained despite Trump stepping back from immediate tariff action and easing concerns of a US-EU trade war.\n\nBullion delivered a powerful breakout, with gold and silver posting fresh all-time highs amid surging safe-haven demand. Comex gold jumped over 8% on the week, extending gains for a third straight week to settle near $4,990 per troy ounce, marking its strongest weekly percentage advance since mid-2020, while Silver surged more than 14%, breaking the $100 per ounce level for the first time and settling above $103.\n\nThe rally was fueled by waning confidence in US assets, renewed trade frictions, a weaker dollar, ongoing geopolitical risks, and sustained central-bank buying. Concerns around US fiscal discipline, Federal Reserve independence, and stress in Japanese government bonds further amplified demand. MCX prices showed even higher volatility ahead of India's February 1 Union Budget.\n\nSilverRate in Mumbai Yesterday\n\nBase metals posted broadly positive performance, led by nickel, which climbed over 6% on renewed supply uncertainty after Indonesia signaled tighter ore quotas and stricter enforcement against illegal mining. Copper advanced more than 2% to finish above $13,100 per tonne, though prices retreated from intraday highs toward the week’s end. Lead was the sole underperformer, slipping nearly 1%.\n\nCopper reflected a rebalancing between lingering supply risks and improving near-term availability. Support came from production disruptions at Capstone Copper’s Mantoverde mine in Chile due to a labour strike, partially offset by progress toward restarting Freeport-McMoRan’s Grasberg operations. However, rising Comex inventories above 500,000 tons, global exchange stocks at their highest since 2018, and a deepening LME cash-to-three-month discount signaled easing tightness.\n\nWTI crude oil ended the week modestly higher, rebounding sharply on Friday to a one-week high of $61.4 per barrel after the US imposed new sanctions on vessels and firms transporting Iranian oil, reviving geopolitical risk. Prices had earlier slipped below $59 per barrel following optimism around potential Ukraine-Russia-US talks, before reversing as Iran-US tensions escalated.\n\nOn the daily chart, MCX Crude Oil futures saw a strong rally last Friday, closing above the prior swing high of Rs 5,613 per barrel. With the price currently above both the Supertrend (7,3) and the 20 EMA, the trend bias is bullish. Momentum is expected to continue upward next week, facing initial resistance near Rs 5,820, then Rs 5,900. Support on any pullback is positioned at Rs 5,400.\n\nWith Iran warning that any attack would be treated as “all-out war,” markets remain alert to the risk of disruptions through the Strait of Hormuz, which carries roughly 20% of global crude flows. Looking ahead, steady inflation and resilient consumer spending in the US are likely to keep the Fed on hold in the upcoming meeting, while Trump’s speech, US PPI, and durable goods data will shape policy expectations."

        "full_content": "Silver crossed the $100 mark for the first time on Comex today (January 23) at 4:25 pm GMT, representing 4.24 percent gain from its previous close. The metal has been on a record spree driven by geopolitical concerns, especially around US-Iran relations, a weaker dollar, and a rise in industrial demand.\n\nOn MCX, silver domestic futures hit the record peak at Rs 3,41,300 per kilogram on Friday (11:21 am IST), and continued to hover at Rs 3,39,217, up 2.05 percent from the previous close of Rs 3,32,393. The price previously peaked at Rs 3,38,804 on January 22, as recorded on MCX.\n\nThe Indian Bullion Jewellers Association (IBJA) pegged silver's price at Rs 3,17,705 per kilogram on its 18:30 rate session, which is approximately a 6 percent gain from Rs 2,99,711 in the last 24 hours.\n\n“Silver touching the $100 per ounce on Comex is a powerful psychological milestone. The surge has been driven by a rare convergence of factors— geopolitical uncertainty, currency debasement, strong industrial demand, and speculative momentum following silver’s breakout to fresh all-time highs,” said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market, an online trading platform.\n\nSilver has been on a record spree driven by a historic short squeeze, strong retail participation, and China’s tightening export controls, adding to supply concerns.\n\nThe metal’s dramatic record surge to the triple digits comes just a day after investors rushed to book profits amid President Trump’s renewed stance on Greenland and withdrew proposed tariffs on European imports.\n\nMarket sentiment shifted after the US President Donald Trump said a fleet of American warships was heading to the Middle East and that Washington was watching Iran closely. A day before, Trump claimed that a NATO deal would give the US permanent access to Greenland, though specifics are still unclear. Meanwhile, as Trump pulled back from proposed tariffs against the EU countries, the day (January 22) saw a dip in prices.\n\nMeanwhile, markets look forward to another rate cut by the US Fed in their upcoming policy meeting scheduled on January 27-28.\n\nShould investors buy, hold, or sell?\n\nKhoo advises investors not to chase the rally blindly. “Price action at these levels is extremely sensitive. From a tactical perspective, short-term traders may consider booking partial profits or tightening stops, as volatility is likely to spike around the $100 handle.”\n\nFor long-term investors, silver still makes sense as a strategic hedge against monetary instability and as a beneficiary of structural demand from energy and technology sectors.\n\n“However, fresh buying is better deferred until a consolidation or pullback toward key support zones, rather than entering at euphoric highs. The bias remains constructive, but disciplined position management is crucial at current levels,” he added.\n\nThe Augmont Bullion, published on January 23, noted that silver prices have corrected but continue to act as strong support. “As long as silver trades above the $90.5 level (Rs 3,00,000), the metal retains the potential to move higher towards the $99-$100 range (Rs 3,45,000). Overall, dips are likely to attract buying interest rather than signal a trend reversal.”"

        "full_content": "Silver topped $100 an ounce for the first time, extending a scorching rally built on surging demand for haven assets and frenzied buying in retail markets from Shanghai to New York.\n\nSpot silver surged as much as 4.2% to $100.29 an ounce on Friday, bringing gains this year to almost 40% after prices more than doubled in 2025. Gold also climbed to a fresh record, edging closer to $5,000 an ounce.\n\nInvestor demand for precious metals intensified during the first year of US President Donald Trump’s second term in the White House, amid growing uncertainties over trade, geopolitics and monetary policy. Worries that silver could be hit with US tariffs triggered a rush to ship metal to New York, culminating with a historic short squeeze in London in October.\n\nSilver’s advance this week was fueled by a rift in Washington’s relations with European allies, while the latest attempts to reach a deal to end the war in Ukraine have so far failed to reach a breakthrough. Challenges to the Federal Reserve’s independence have also fanned demand.\n\nMeanwhile, the global silver market has been in a supply deficit for five years. As prices push higher, there’s been a wave of retail buying. And in China, investors have piled into silver as an affordable alternative to gold, while in the US, there’s been a frenzy that’s overwhelmed dealers.\n\nSome banks had already forecast silver to break into three figures. In a January note, Citigroup Inc. upgraded its near-term outlook for a jump to $100 an ounce, along with a prediction that gold could surge to $5,000 an ounce.\n\nPrecious metals have also found support after Trump said he had concluded interviews for the next Federal Reserve chair, a move that has revived concerns about the central bank’s independence.\n\nThe metal’s climb came despite a decision by the US in January to hold off from imposing import tariffs on critical minerals. Trump said he would negotiate bilateral agreements to ensure adequate supplies of the materials, floating price floors, while not ruling out levies.\n\nIn addition to being a financial asset, silver also has a key industrial role given it’s an efficient conductor of electricity, with the solar industry a major buyer.\n\nStill, costlier prices have prompted some firms to cut back, with substitution and an anticipated slowdown in global solar installations,set to cut the sector’s silver consumption by about 17% this year, Shanghai Metals Market data show.\n\nSpot gold traded at $4,961.74 an ounce as of 11:02 a.m. in New York and is on track for an 8% weekly gain, its strongest performance since March 2020. Silver was 3.8% higher at $99.93 an ounce. Platinum also hit a record Friday."

This is not a qualification of the bank’s financials. This is a qualification in the subsidiary’s financials, which pertains to certain incidents in past years,” the management said.\n\nHe added that the financial impact of these issues had already been fully provided for in earlier years, and the ongoing exercise relates primarily to staff accountability and closure of investigative processes, rather than identification of fresh losses.\n\n“What is now going on is simply the investigation in terms of staff accountability and figuring out if there is anything open that is left. There is no financial impact coming out of this,” management said.\n\nResponding to questions on the nature of the investigation, the bank confirmed that the qualified conclusion relates to BFIL’s role as a business correspondent in the microfinance segment, and is linked to certain practices in past years, including around collections.\n\nManagement described the auditor’s qualification as procedural rather than adverse, noting that the auditors have stated they are unable to conclude whether any additional aspects require examination until the investigation is completed.\n\n“It is simply a qualified report stating that until completion of the investigation, they are not able to establish if there is any other aspect that needs to be looked at. But the financial implications are all taken,” the executive said.\n\nWhen asked whether the matter related to earlier frauds or defaults at the ground level, management responded in the affirmative, reiterating that these had already been identified and accounted for in previous periods.\n\nThe bank also emphasised that there is no financial implication on IndusInd Bank’s books, either standalone or consolidated, arising from the continuing qualification at BFIL."

        "full_content": "As India prepares for the Union Budget 2026, housing finance institutions are looking beyond incremental measures to structural reforms that can meaningfully improve housing affordability and expand homeownership. With urbanisation accelerating, household aspirations evolving and first-time buyers entering the market in larger numbers, the Budget presents an opportunity to recalibrate policy levers in line with today’s economic realities.\n\nAffordability remains the single most critical factor shaping home-buying decisions. While interest rates, income growth and supply dynamics play a role, fiscal and regulatory support continue to be decisive enablers, particularly for the affordable and mid-income housing segments.\n\nFrom a housing finance perspective, the focus this year must shift to modernising definitions, deepening access to credit and strengthening last-mile execution.\n\nRevisiting the definition of affordable housing\n\nOne of the most pressing structural gaps today lies in the definition of affordable housing itself. The current property value threshold of Rs 45 lakh no longer reflects market realities. Over the past few years, land prices, construction costs, regulatory compliance expenses and input inflation have increased significantly, especially across Tier 1 cities and rapidly growing Tier 2 hubs. As a result, even modest, end-user homes often fall outside the existing affordability bracket.\n\nIncreasing the affordable housing limit from Rs 45 lakh to Rs 75 lakh would be a logical and market-aligned reform. This change would not dilute the intent of affordable housing; rather, it would modernise it. A revised threshold would allow policy benefits to reach genuine middle-income and first-time buyers who are currently excluded despite facing affordability constraints. For housing finance institutions, such a move would also create greater clarity in product design and eligibility, enabling more targeted lending without encouraging speculative demand.\n\nStrengthening tax incentives for home buyers\n\nTax benefits have historically played a catalytic role in encouraging home ownership. While existing deductions on homeloaninterest and principal repayment have provided relief, there is scope to enhance their effectiveness. A higher interest deduction limit for self-occupied homes, especially for first-time buyers, could improve monthly affordability and purchasing confidence.\n\nEqually important is continuity and clarity. Stable, long-term tax incentives allow buyers to plan better and lenders to design products with greater certainty. From a sector standpoint, predictable policy signals are far more effective than short-term stimulus.\n\nLowering the cost of credit and expanding access\n\nAccess to affordable credit is central to boosting housing demand. Housing finance companies and banks have significantly strengthened their underwriting, risk management and digital capabilities over the past few years. Budgetary support that enables further reduction in the cost of funds, whether through targeted refinancing windows, partial credit enhancement mechanisms or expanded priority sector allocations can help lenders pass on benefits to borrowers.\n\nFor underserved segments, especially informal income households and self-employed borrowers, policy-backed risk-sharing co-lending partnerships can unlock credit flow without compromising asset quality. This is particularly relevant in Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets, where demand is strong, but formal credit penetration remains uneven.\n\nAccelerating supply-side execution\n\nAffordability is as much about supply as it is about demand. Faster project approvals, rationalisation of GST on under-construction properties and incentives for developers focused on mass housing can improve supply efficiency and pricing discipline. A coordinated push to streamline approvals at the state and local levels would reduce project timelines, lower financing costs and ultimately benefit home buyers.\n\nIn parallel, continued investment in urban infrastructure such as transport, water, sanitation and connectivity enhances the liveability and value of affordable housing projects, making them more attractive to end-users.\n\nA long-term vision for housing-led growth\n\nHousing has always been a long-gestation sector, but affordability cannot wait. Union Budget 2026 could reset the housing narrative by aligning policy with today’s price realities and evolving buyer profiles. Affordability today is about relevance, not relief, and if the focus shifts to execution-led reforms rather than incremental tweaks, housing can once again emerge as a reliable driver of economic momentum while turning home ownership from a stretched aspiration into a practical, confident decision.\n\n(Mehernosh Tata is MD & CEO, Godrej Housing Finance.)\n\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication."

The company had posted a loss of Rs 59.3 crore in the previous quarter, according to regulatory filings.\n\nThe company's revenue from operations grew 33 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 382.68 crore in Q3 from Rs 287.92 crore in the same period last year. On a sequential basis, revenue remainedd flat from Rs 380 crore in the previous quarter.\n\nLosses were primarily driven by the company’s recently launched 15-minute home services vertical InstaHelp.\n\nAt a consolidated level, the business reported an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) loss of Rs 17 crore, driven by ongoing investments in InstaHelp, which scaled rapidly during the quarter but incurred an adjusted EBITDA loss of Rs 61 crore.\n\nExcluding InstaHelp, the core business delivered an Adjusted EBITDA profit of Rs 44 crore. “We expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA losses to persist in the near term as investments in InstaHelp continue, while the core business remains profitable,” the company said.\n\n\"We expect to reach consolidated Adjusted EBITDA breakeven by Q3 FY28, as profits from our India Consumer Services (Ex InstaHelp) and international markets offset the losses of InstaHelp. We expect the India Consumer Services (Ex InstaHelp) and International (UAE & Singapore) business to continue expanding their Adjusted EBITDA margins over the next few years and expect Native to continue its path to profitability,\" the firm said in its letter to shareholders.\n\nUrban Company's cash burn stood at Rs 42 crore in Q3 FY26, compared to a surplus of Rs 61 crore a year ago.\n\nThe Gurugram-based firm's total expenses, meanwhile, increased 43 percent YoY to Rs 432.83 crore in the December quarter, compared to Rs 301.90 in Q3 FY25.

        "full_content": "Zoho will announce its expansion in Uttar Pradesh this year as part of its hub-and-spoke model, founder and chief scientist Sridhar Vembu toldMoneycontrol, marking the company’s return to its north India growth plans after a pause of nearly a year and a half.\n\n“This year we will announce our expansion in Uttar Pradesh,” Vembu said, explaining that the company had temporarily slowed new regional projects to focus on navigating rapid changes driven by artificial intelligence.\n\n“When you are dealing with something as disruptive as AI, you don’t want too many parallel initiatives running at the same time. Now we feel more confident about how to handle it,\"he added.\n\nHe said Zoho believes it is now in a stronger position to both “AI-proof” and “AI-boost” its business, allowing it to resume geographic expansion.\n\nThe Uttar Pradesh move is expected to follow Zoho’s hub-and-spoke model, similar to its centres in smaller towns such as Tenkasi and Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu.\n\nSeparately, Vembu said Zoho continues to invest in semiconductor design but has put its semiconductor fabrication plant plans on hold. “We are investing in semiconductor design right now.\n\nThe fab plan has been paused because we have too many things going on, especially with AI. We will revisit it in a couple of years,” he said.\n\nHe added that building a chip fabrication unit is a capital- and resource-intensive exercise, and the company wants to prioritise its core software and AI strategy before taking on such a large-scale project.\n\nZoho’s semiconductor design efforts remain part of its long-term roadmap, but manufacturing will wait until the company has greater clarity and bandwidth.\n\nThe model was first implemented in Tenkasi in 2011, which later grew into one of Zoho’s most important development centres outside Chennai. Madurai functions as another regional hub within Tamil Nadu.\n\nBeyond Tamil Nadu, Zoho has expanded this approach to Andhra Pradesh, with Renigunta acting as a key centre, and has also begun building its presence in Uttar Pradesh, where the company has indicated that more focused expansion plans will follow.\n\nThe company has also set up operations in parts of Kerala, including smaller towns, in line with its decentralisation strategy.\n\nZoho has consistently said a significant portion of its workforce in such centres is hired locally, supported by internal training programmes such as Zoho Schools of Learning instead of conventional campus recruitment."

        "full_content": "Gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) have recorded a significant recovery on January 23 to resume their record rally, after a crash during the previous session. Analysts have suggested which precious metal sees more upside amid this volatility.\n\nTata Silver ETF, which had crashed up to 24 percent yesterday, hitting a low of Rs 25.56 apiece. The ETF rebounded sharply today, rising more than 17 percent to hit the day’s high at Rs 33 apiece. This marks a 29 percent jump from the low hit by the ETF earlier yesterday.\n\nGroww Gold ETFis currently the top gainer among all the gold ETFs. The ETFs jumped 7 percent to trade at Rs 155.97 apiece today. The sharp surge in gold and silver ETFs is a clear reflection of how aggressively investors are repositioning toward safe-haven assets amid heightened global uncertainty, said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market.\n\nShould you buy gold or silver?\n\nMotilal Oswal Financial Services in its latest note highlighted that silver has delivered an exceptional rally of over 200 percent in the past 12 months, sharply outperforming gold’s 80 percent rise during the same period. This made silver one of the strongest-performing assets globally.\n\nHowever, the domestic brokerage noted that this sharp outperformance of the white metal has led to a significant compression in the gold–silver ratio, which has fallen from pandemic highs of 127 to around 50 at the beginning of 2026.\n\n“This reset suggests that while the long-term outlook for precious metals remains constructive, the near-term risk-reward equation may now be shifting in favour of gold after silver’s outsized run,” Motilal said.\n\n“Silver has delivered sharp outperformance in a short span, and with the gold–silver ratio now near lower levels, the near-term risk-reward is turning more favourable for gold. While we remain positive on both metals and silver continues to have long-term upside backed by industrial demand and tight physical market conditions, the recent rally has also increased near-term volatility. In this phase, a higher allocation to gold can help manage fluctuations while staying invested in precious metals,” said Navneet Damani, Head of Research Commodities and Manav Modi, Commodities Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.\n\nHowever, the domestic brokerage emphasized that it does not have a negative view on silver. But, it suggests a risk-managed reallocation strategy after an aggressive up move. It added that silver has become more volatile with sharper price swings, while gold continues to offer relatively better stability—making it a preferred near-term hedge in uncertain market conditions.\n\nDespite the sharp surge in prices, global silver ETFs have seen outflows of over 3 million ounces since the start of 2026, while gold ETFs have witnessed comparatively steadier inflows, reflecting investor preference for more defensive positioning, Motilal added.\n\nThe brokerage advises investors a 75 percent allocation to gold and 25 percent to silver, indicating a preference for gold as a relatively steadier hedge in the current environment, while still retaining meaningful exposure to silver’s long-term structural upside.\n\n“Going forward, we believe investors can benefit from a rebalanced precious metals strategy—retaining silver as a long-term structural theme, while increasing gold allocation to manage near-term volatility and capture a potentially stronger risk-adjusted opportunity in the next phase of the cycle,” Damani said.\n\nLong-term investors may consider staggered allocation within asset allocation limits, while short-term traders should remain cautious amid continued volatility, said Aditya Agrawal, Chief Investment Officer at Avisa Wealth Creators.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here."

        "full_content": "The Union Budget 2025 continued India’s focus on the climate and sustainability agenda, with measures to advance clean-tech manufacturing, renewable energy adoption, sustainable agriculture and urban development, nuclear power development, and electric mobility, among many others. These steps were aligned with India’s 2070 Net-Zero commitment, supporting tangible progress reflected in rapidly growing renewable capacity, improving rooftop solar uptake, strengthening R&D for climate-focused technologies, and signalling the decarbonisation roadmap for hard-to-abate sectors. The Budget also made space for circular economy initiatives and dedicated support for MSMEs, reflecting an integrated approach to green growth. Building on this momentum, the forthcoming Budget 2026 is expected to deepen these priorities so that India can scale from intent to deliver across the next leg of its transition.\n\nRenewable Energy, Storage, and Grid Readiness\n\nEnergy transition remains central to India’s decarbonisation strategy. While renewable capacity additions have been encouraging, the next phase of India’s energy journey must address persistent challenges related to storage and transmission. Customs and tax support for battery manufacturing and the announcement of Viability Gap Funding have been positive, but Budget 2026 will need to deepen this support. Continued incentivisation for storage solutions and encouragement of scalability is a major area to watch. It remains to be seen which mechanisms will be used, given the aggressive pricing environment—whether through tax sops, inclusion under PLI schemes, mandated storage solutions, or financing support.\n\nAnother lever for strengthening energy security and sustainability has been the push for rooftop solar installations, which received an allocation of Rs 20,000 crore last year, up from Rs 13,500 crore. Ambitious targets and further allocations are expected to support the pace of adoption.\n\nBeyond core mitigation efforts, India’s environmental agenda requires robust, scalable technologies for air emissions, water efficiency, waste management, and industrial decarbonisation. Early-stage pilots in carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), green hydrogen, and alternative fuels underscore the potential of emerging technologies. However, their viability in the Indian context demands targeted investment, demonstration support, and accelerated commercialisation pathways. Technology and innovation will remain the backbone of India’s climate transition, and a continued push for R&D—particularly in energy-efficient and low-carbon industrial processes, as witnessed last year—is widely expected in the upcoming Budget.\n\nScaling Climate Technologies and Industrial Decarbonisation\n\nThe development of climate and sustainable finance, along with related market mechanisms, demands heightened attention. Deepening financial markets and encouraging attractive funding options are critical not only for meeting net-zero ambitions but also for improving efficiency across the system. The announcement and operationalisation of a Climate Finance Taxonomy would enable credible green finance and reduce greenwashing risks, which is crucial for investor and stakeholder confidence. Moreover, a fast-paced transition journey calls for financial incentives for green, social, and sustainable instruments for issuers and lenders.\n\nSuch mechanisms could be varied—preferential capital treatment, priority tagging and targets for lenders, concessional interest rates, lower processing fees, innovative and longer-tenor financing structures to support project viability, and rewards linked to credible ESG performance and ratings, to name a few. To improve access to green credit facilities and strengthen market discipline, introducing basic ESG disclosure norms for MSMEs and private players would be a positive step.\n\nMeasures to support a viable carbon market through a clear pricing architecture and robust monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) norms would offer confidence to all stakeholders—carbon credit buyers and sellers alike—and strengthen India’s Carbon Credit Trading Scheme. This would also help industries better prepare for decarbonisation targets and global stakeholder expectations.\n\nResource Security, Urban Resilience, and Inclusive Growth\n\nResource security through critical minerals and circular economy measures is another emerging strategic priority. The upcoming Budget is expected to accelerate the National Critical Mineral Mission, which saw a doubling of its allocation to Rs 3,500 crore last year. Given the importance of critical minerals and rare earth metals to manufacturing value chains, further announcements related to resource security are anticipated. Promotion of circular economy and waste-to-wealth initiatives through strong frameworks for inter-industry collaboration, support for related technology platforms, and expanded Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) initiatives would result in more productive and efficient value chains.\n\nAn update on the implementation and way forward for the Urban Challenge Fund of Rs 10,000 crore for the first year, out of a total planned allocation of Rs 1,00,000 crore, would also place climate adaptation in focus, alongside dispersed economic growth and water infrastructure development. Continued emphasis on irrigation and flood mitigation is anticipated, building on the existing Rs 95,000 crore allocation.\n\nSocial, Governance, and Sustainability for Inclusive Growth\n\nRecent labour reform announcements and expanded CSR requirements place greater responsibility on companies, while the Government’s parallel focus on skills development, women’s workforce participation, and social protection will help build a more capable and diverse talent base. On the governance front, initiatives to strengthen frameworks and oversight would be a positive step towards enhancing India Inc.’s long-term resilience and its ability to attract growth capital.\n\nBudget 2026 should deepen India’s climate and sustainability agenda by accelerating clean-tech manufacturing, renewables, storage, and scalable decarbonisation technologies. Strengthening the sustainable finance ecosystem through a Climate Finance Taxonomy and targeted incentives will be essential to unlocking capital for the transition. Progress on critical minerals and circular economy initiatives will be key enablers, alongside a continued focus on social and governance reforms that enhance India Inc.’s resilience and competitiveness.\n\n(Sheetal Sharad, Chief Ratings Officer, ICRA ESG.)\n\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication."

        "full_content": "Former Google and Airbnb executive Peeyush Ranjan, who also served as CTO of Walmart-owned Flipkart, and Mukesh Bansal, co-founder of Myntra, on January 23 launched Fermi.ai, an AI-first edtech startup focused on high-school STEM education in India and the United States.\n\nThe startup, which has emerged from the Meraki Labs ecosystem, is headquartered in Singapore and operates through subsidiaries in India and the US. Fermi.ai is available free on the cloud, as the company remains in a pilot and product-discovery phase, Ranjan toldMoneycontrol.\n\nThe launch comes at a time when the edtech sector is recalibrating after a funding boom-and-bust cycle, even as generative AI tools such as ChatGPT become deeply embedded in how students study. Ranjan said the company was built to address growing concerns that AI is increasingly being used as a shortcut rather than a learning aid.\n\n“Students are getting answers faster than ever but their understanding is getting weaker,” Ranjan said. “Learning happens through productive struggle. What we’ve tried to build is an AI tutor that supports that struggle instead of replacing it.”\n\nDesigned to guide, not give answers\n\nUnlike most AI-powered learning tools that surface solutions quickly, Fermi.ai is designed to withhold final answers, guiding students through problems step by step instead. The platform uses a stylus-first, canvas-based interface, allowing students to write equations, draw diagrams and work through reasoning in a format closer to pen-and-paper problem solving.\n\nThe product currently covers maths, physics and chemistry and is built around four core components: an adaptive real-time tutor, a handwriting-first canvas, a curriculum-linked concept graph with an exam-aligned question bank (including AP, IB and JEE), and diagnostic tools that show students and teachers where reasoning breaks down.\n\nBansal said the platform is meant to surface gaps in thinking rather than mask them. “AI can solve any equation but it can’t yet explain why a student’s logic failed at step three,” he said. “Fermi.ai is meant to show students how they think and give teachers visibility into silent struggles.”\n\nThe platform uses multiple large language models, including OpenAI and Google models, benchmarking each for different tasks and integrating them into a single system. Ranjan said the company does not train on school-owned data, with teacher-uploaded content remaining with institutions.\n\nPilot results and measured rollout\n\nBefore the rollout, Fermi.ai ran a three-month pilot with 79 students, covering more than 15,000 concept tests. According to data shared by the company, students who initially scored two out of ten or lower improved by an average of 4.68 points by their final attempts, while overall mastery scores rose by 2.6 points between early and later practice attempts.\n\nThe company is running pilots in Bengaluru, north India and Silicon Valley, with discussions underway to expand pilots to additional regions. While the platform is now accessible globally, Ranjan said the company will remain hands-on over the next few months rather than pursue aggressive scale.\n\n“We want to be sure we’re landing with a great product before we start scaling hard,” he said.\n\nMonetisation, funding and next steps\n\nDespite the launch, monetisation has not yet been finalised. Fermi.ai is currently free and pricing discussions are expected once product capabilities and customer segments are clearer. The likely model is per-student, per-seat pricing, with teachers accessing the platform at no cost.\n\nThe platform is positioned as a supplemental learning tool, acting as a teacher’s assistant in classrooms and as a standalone tutor outside school. It is designed to work on devices with a Chrome browser and stylus support, including Chromebooks and tablets, without requiring dedicated hardware investments.\n\nFermi.ai is fully funded by Meraki Labs and has not raised external capital. Ranjan said the company is not actively fundraising and will consider raising a dedicated round after finalising the product and pricing strategy.\n\nThe launch adds to the growing influence of the so-called “Flipkart mafia ”— former Flipkart founders and senior executives who have gone on to build and back startups across sectors. With Fermi.ai, Ranjan and Bansal are extending that operating experience into AI-driven education, even as many founders tread cautiously around mass-market K–12 plays.\n\nFor now, the founders say the focus is on refining the product and validating the model before scaling, as AI continues to reshape how students learn and how teachers respond."

        "full_content": "Payments infrastructure company Juspay on January 23 announced that it has raised $50 million in a Series D follow-on round from WestBridge Capital at a valuation of $1.2 billion, as the startup looks to accelerate its global expansion and strengthen its position as a core payments infrastructure provider for enterprises and banks.\n\nThe funding comes at a time when large merchants and financial institutions are increasingly seeking full-stack, scalable and reliable payments platforms to support growing digital transaction volumes across markets.\n\nWhere will Juspay use the funding?\n\nThe round is a mix of primary and secondary transactions. The primary capital will be used to fund Juspay’s expansion across international markets and deepen investments in its technology stack, while the secondary component will provide liquidity to early investors and employees holding ESOPs. This marks the second liquidity event facilitated by the company within a year.\n\nJuspay plans to deploy the funds to expand its footprint across Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, Europe, the UK and North America.\n\nThe company will also invest in strengthening its payments infrastructure and advancing its artificial intelligence capabilities to improve merchant experience and internal productivity.\n\n“Our focus over the last decade has been on solving the core complexities of global payments through first-principles engineering and design,” said Sheetal Lalwani, co-founder and chief operating officer of Juspay.\n\n“This round reflects our growth and provides liquidity opportunities for our early investors and team members who have been part of this journey,\" he added.\n\nWhy did WestBridge invest in Juspay?\n\nWestBridge Capital said Juspay’s evolution into a full-stack payments infrastructure provider was a key factor behind the investment.\n\n“They have moved from payment orchestration to building core payments infrastructure for banks and enterprises, while maintaining a sustainable growth trajectory,” said Deepak Ramineedi, partner at WestBridge Capital.\n\nFounded in 2012, Juspay provides payment infrastructure to enterprises and banks, enabling them to process large-scale digital transactions reliably.\n\nIn April 2025, Juspaysecured $60 millionin a Series D ongoing funding round led by private equity firm Kedaara Capital. The round included a mix of primary and secondary investments, with participation from existing backers SoftBank and Accel.\n\nThe company processes over 300 million transactions daily and has crossed an annualised total payment volume of $1 trillion. Its customers include companies such as Agoda, Amazon, Flipkart, Google, HSBC, IndiGo, Swiggy, Zepto and Zurich Insurance.\n\nJuspay said it is focused on building open, interoperable and modular payments infrastructure that can support global commerce at scale. It is also investing in artificial intelligence to improve efficiency across operations and merchant-facing platforms.\n\nJuspayturned profitable in FY25, reporting a profit of Rs 115 crore before exceptional items and tax. Revenue from operations rose 61 per cent year-on-year to Rs 514 crore, driven by higher digital transaction volumes and operational efficiencies.\n\nIn FY25, Juspay recorded a Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs 27 crore and a Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs 62 crore. The PAT figure is higher than PBT due to deferred tax adjustments."

        "full_content": "Primary market issuances have cooled sharply, with January seeing only three initial public offerings so far, as sustained volatility in equity markets has prompted companies to remain on the sidelines.\n\nAfter a record year in 2025, when companies raised Rs 1.76 trillion through IPOs, fundraising activity in 2026 has remained muted so far. January till date, only three companies have launched public issues this year, collectively raising about Rs 4,765 crore. These include Bharat Coking Coal, Amagi Media Labs and Shadowfax Technologies.\n\nIndustry experts said while a few IPOs could enter the market in the coming months, many companies are likely to defer listing plans due to continued market uncertainty. Several firms that have already received regulatory approval may delay launches as volatile conditions make pricing difficult. Prolonged delays could also result in the expiry of financial statements included in draft prospectuses, requiring companies to update disclosures with the latest financials and further postponing fundraising plans.\n\nGaurav Bhandari, Chief Executive Officer of Monarch Networth Capital, said the slowdown in primary market activity is largely due to the meaningful correction witnessed across broader market and mid-cap indices. He said intense selling in these segments has created opportunities at lower valuations, prompting investors to deploy capital toward averaging existing holdings rather than subscribing to new issues, resulting in muted IPO activity.\n\nDespite the slowdown, the IPO pipeline for 2026 remains strong. More than 200 companies are preparing to tap the markets. Of these, 88 firms have already secured Securities and Exchange Board of India approval to raise over Rs 1 lakh crore, while others are awaiting clearance for an additional Rs 1.5 lakh crore. The pipeline includes several large names such as Hero Fincorp, Reliance Jio, Flipkart, PhonePe, HDFC Securities, OYO, Zepto and Boat.\n\nExperts said the pace of IPO launches seen over the past two years will depend heavily on overall market conditions and cannot be viewed in isolation. IPO activity is influenced not only by institutional participation but also by sentiment among high-net-worth individuals and retail investors, making secondary market stability a key factor for revival. They added that activity may remain subdued for a few months until broader markets stabilise, unless supported by major policy or budget-related announcements. Predicting an exact recovery timeline remains difficult, as market normalisation depends on multiple domestic and global factors.\n\nVinit Bolinjkar, Head of Research at Ventura, said progress on trade agreements between India and key global partners, including the United States, along with improved global economic stability, could act as meaningful catalysts for renewed momentum in the primary markets.\n\nSome experts also noted that the size of the IPO pipeline has contributed to caution, with concerns that multiple large offerings launched simultaneously could strain market liquidity. As a result, issuers are opting to stagger launches rather than rush multiple offerings at the same time. They added that muted post-listing performance of some recently listed companies has further cooled investor sentiment, although this phase does not indicate the end of the IPO cycle.\n\nUday Patil, Executive Director at PL Capital Markets, said companies had filed IPO documents based on pricing assumptions prevailing under earlier market conditions. With sentiment having changed, issuers may now need to revise valuation expectations. However, regulatory limits on reducing issue sizes have prompted several companies to defer launches instead of cutting prices sharply.\n\nPatil added that investors have become increasingly selective, preferring offerings at more reasonable valuations. He noted that some recent IPOs have been priced at discounts to earlier private placement valuations, reflecting current market conditions."

        "full_content": "The National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO) has recommended the Union Ministry of Finance a slew of measures for the upcoming Union budget such as setting a higher limit for interest deduction on home loans and reinstatement of the Income Tax Settlement Commission.\n\n\"The limit for interest deduction on homeloansshould be raised from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh or more for owner occupied houses. Also, five years period for acquisition or completion from the year of borrowing should be dispensed with,\" NAREDCO said in its recommendations to the Union Ministry of Finance on January 22.\n\nCurrently, under Section 24(b) of IT Act 1961 (Section 22 of IT Act 2025), deduction on account of interest payment on housing loans is permissible to owners of rented dwelling units to the fullest extent. In case of owner-occupied houses, the limit is set at Rs 2 lakh.\n\nParveen Jain, President, NAREDCO, said that rationalising taxation, especially on housing finance, will directly stimulate end-user demand.\n\n“The move will provide much-needed impetus to a sector grappling with a significant housing shortage and offer relief to homebuyers impacted by project delays arising from cash flow constraints, while restoring overall buyer confidence,” he said.\n\nNAREDCO has also suggested the reinstatement of the Income-tax Settlement Commission. The commission established in 1976 to provide taxpayers a one-time opportunity to enter into a compromise and settlement arrangement with the Income-tax Authority to grant them relief from penalties and prosecution, was discontinued with effective from February 1, 2021.\n\n\"Restoring and strengthening dispute resolution mechanisms like the Income-tax Settlement Commission is critical for fostering a transparent, investor-friendly environment in the real estate sector. Coupled with rationalized taxation policies, these reforms will catalyse sustainable growth, boost housing affordability,\" said, Niranjan Hiranandani, Chairman, NAREDCO.\n\nThe recommendations gain significance as the real estate sector comprises about 7-8 percent of India's GDP and is the second largest employer after agriculture with about 19 percent of the country's total workforce.\n\nThe developers’ body also recommended that entities engaged in real estate business should be exempted from the burden of tax on notional rental income, as there is a need to incentivise rental housing in India."

        "full_content": "India’s housing market is entering a new phase this year, with lifestyle and sustainability-led preferences set to play a decisive role in home-buying decisions, industry insiders have said.\n\nAnnual housing demand is expected to remain around 30–40 million square feet in 2026, with new supply estimated at 35–40 million square feet, a report by real estate consultancy Colliers India  has said.\n\nMarket observers says buyers are increasingly prioritising wellness, sustainability, efficiency and long-term liveability, reflecting evolving urban lifestyles and the growing influence of work-from-home and hybrid work models.\n\nLifestyle and wellness take centre stage\n\nLarger homes, integrated lifestyle amenities, open green spaces and community-oriented planning are fast becoming central to purchase decisions, they said.\n\nGaurs Group CMD Manoj Gaur said buyers are far more conscious about how a home supports their lifestyle over the next decade.\n\n“In 2026, demand will increasingly gravitate towards developments that offer wellness-focused amenities, green open areas, and sustainable design. Buyers are not just looking at square footage—they want experience-led living and environments that enhance overall quality of life,” he said.\n\nYamini Agarwal, CMO, Nimbus Realty, lifestyle-oriented homes are no longer limited to luxury buyers.\n\n“We are seeing strong interest even from end-users upgrading from mid-segment housing. They want larger homes, better air quality, open spaces, and a sense of community. Projects that integrate lifestyle and sustainability from the planning stage are seeing better absorption and stronger buyer confidence,” she said.\n\nSustainability moves from optional to essential\n\nMarket observers say sustainability is fast becoming a core driver of residential demand, propelled by rising awareness of climate risk, higher utility costs and a desire for healthier living spaces.\n\nAccording to a report by Carbon Guardians, a sustainability-focused real estate solutions firm, India’s green building market is projected to grow to nearly $85 billion by 2032.\n\n“Developers who embed sustainable features at the planning stage such as rainwater harvesting, solar integration, waste-management systems, and low-carbon materials are seeing better traction in the market,” Gaur added.\n\nGautam Kanodia, Founder, KREEVA and Kanodia Group, said energy-efficient and ESG-aligned homes are attracting not only lifestyle buyers but also institutional interest, as sustainable design becomes an increasingly important metric for long-term value and investment quality.\n\n“Sustainability and lifestyle aren’t just buzzwords, they’re becoming core decision filters for buyers. Future-ready homes with strong ESG credentials are likely to outperform in both absorption and resale value in 2026,” he said.\n\nBranded housing to lead growth\n\nThe Colliers report also points to broader market trends supporting lifestyle and sustainability-led demand.\n\nDevelopers are responding by launching branded and experience-oriented projects that combine premium lifestyle amenities with strong design and sustainability measures, targeting buyers who value comfort, long-term income potential and quality of life.\n\nAgarwal said the evolving buyer base in 2026 includes affluent end-users and dual-income families seeking wellness-oriented environments, professionals prioritising work-life balance and community living, NRIs and investors focused on sustainability and branded housing promising capital preservation.\n\n“Compared to a few years ago, buyers are now as concerned about where they live and how they live as much as what they pay,” she said."

So, we look to invest around $250 million (in India this year),” Kapoor said.\n\nThis will be across 2-3 deals and in companies building in five key sectors.\n\n“In India, we like healthcare a lot, consumer, including technology, IT services and financial services…they kind of lean in quite nicely into our global investment thesis as well,” Kapoor said in the interview to Moneycontrol.\n\nInvestcorp entered India only in 2018 and has backed companies such as Xpressbees, Wakefit, FreshToHome, InsuranceDekho, among others. In about eight years its assets under management (AUM) has already crossed the $1 billion mark, as per Kapoor.\n\n“India, both in terms of performance and growth, has been actually one of our stronger performing markets…it continues to be one of our top three conviction markets going forward,” he said.\n\nMore recently it also raised a Rs 5,000 crore fund which is expected to be deployed “relatively quickly” indicating a more aggressive pace for Investcorp in India.\n\nWhile several investors look to invest in data centres in India, Investcorp is staying away from that theme, at least for now.\n\n“There is so much capital that has gone into data centres that it has compressed returns to levels where they are not necessarily the most optimal for our investors,” Kapoor said.\n\n“So, instead, the broader agenda around AI, cloud computing, digital architecture and infrastructure and digitisation of corporate value chains is what we are liking a lot,” he concluded."

So far, 20 startups have been chosen for the initiative, its website shows, with half of them based in Singapore and Taiwan.\n\nIPOs have been booming across the region, with India setting a record last year and Hong Kong proceeds at a multiyear high. Tokyo is looking to carve out its own slice of the market, counting on its deep pools of liquidity being attractive for companies that are too small for the US market and are concerned with geopolitical risks in Hong Kong.\n\n“We are looking to have as many companies whose shares keep rising over a long period as possible and that’s not limited to Japanese firms,” Tokyo Stock Exchange President Moriyuki Iwanaga said.\n\nThe plan may result in more than 20 cross-border IPOs in the next three years, according to Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corp., one of the partners in the initiative. That compares with just four such deals in 2023-2025, according to the bourse’s website.\n\n“Liquidity after listing is significantly important for companies as management engages with shareholders and stakeholders to raise corporate value,” said Atsushi Takahashi, a senior manager at the trust bank.\n\nTonik Financial Pte., a Mizuho Bank Ltd.-backed digital bank based in the Philippines that joined the TSE’s initiative, is actively exploring listing in Tokyo in the next two or three years, founder Greg Krasnov said, citing the access to liquidity and investor base specifically.\n\nSome companies are also weighing a Tokyo IPO as they look to expand in Japan, especially in the entertainment and tourism industries.\n\n“So many Asians love to go to Japan,” said Ming Chen, chief executive officer of KKday, an online travel platform operator based in Taiwan, which generates about half of its revenue from Japan. “If we can list in Japan, we can build more trust with our suppliers, local partners.”\n\nThe bourse failed to achieve its goal to list 20 cross-border companies in its mid-term management plan from April 2022 to March 2025, with only five such deals, including e-commerce platform operator Anymind Group Inc. and space technology company Astroscale Holdings Inc. according to its website.\n\nThe bourse is also looking at cross-border IPOs as a way to beef up its pipeline. Tokyo is considering raising the bar for companies to stay in the public market to ensure the growth of listed firms."

        "full_content": "Milkfood Ltd., one of India’s listed dairy companies, has monetised a key real estate asset in Uttar Pradesh by selling its Moradabad manufacturing unit for Rs 130 crore.\n\nThe company informed stock exchanges that it has signed an ‘agreement to sell’ its dairy plant located at Agwanpur in Moradabad, marking a decisive step in its ongoing business reorganisation and deleveraging strategy. The transaction has resulted in a net cash inflow of Rs 116.11 crore after taxes, the company said.\n\nThe sale has generated a net profit of Rs 78.04 crore on land, underscoring the value of industrial real estate assets in the region. Milkfood reported no loss on the sale of plant and machinery and recorded a profit of Rs 7.54 crore on buildings. A reversal of Rs 37.37 crore from revaluation reserves was disclosed as a non-cash accounting adjustment, the company said.\n\nThe company said that a significant portion of the proceeds would be used to repay debt. Milkfood plans to repayloansworth Rs 75 crore, a move expected to reduce annual finance costs by around Rs 9.25 crore.\n\nThe company will also benefit from savings of nearly Rs 8.5 crore a year in plant-related overheads, taking the combined annual benefit to about Rs 17.75 crore, the firm said.\n\nThese measures are expected to lead to an earnings accretion of approximately Rs 7.25 per share (face value Rs 5), reflecting the immediate financial upside of the asset sale, the company said.\n\n“This transaction reflects a disciplined approach to capital allocation. By monetising a non-core asset, we are meaningfully reducing debt, improving cash flows and creating financial headroom to pursue growth opportunities,” said Sudhir Avasthi, Managing Director, Milkfood Ltd.\n\nThe company plans to invest in new capacities, including ice-cream manufacturing, while also evaluating expansion opportunities in cheese and butter segments, which continue to see strong demand in urban and semi-urban markets, the firm said.\n\nOperationally, Milkfood intends to scale up production at its Patiala facility. The company estimates that turnover could reach Rs 750 crore by FY27, with EBITDA margins of around 7 percent.\n\nIndustry watchers see the Moradabad asset sale as part of a wider trend of companies unlocking value from industrial land and manufacturing real estate to strengthen balance sheets and fund growth."

        "full_content": "As India gears up for the Union Budget 2026, the real estate sector once again finds itself at the crossroads, linking\n\npolicy, capital, and long-term urban transformation. The sector is rarely the loudest sector in fiscal debates, yet it remains one of the most deeply intertwined with how the economy functions and how cities take shape.  In that sense, real estate is less a standalone industry and more a connective tissue linking policy intent with lived reality.\n\nDemand has showed surprising resilience\n\nOver the past two years, the sector has shown a degree of resilience that few anticipated in the aftermath of global uncertainty and domestic recalibration.\n\nDemand has held steady across housing segments, with premium and luxury markets continuing to find depth among buyers who value stability, quality, and long-term asset security.\n\nThis sustained momentum has not been accidental. It reflects a period of regulatory maturity, improved governance, and a cautious rebuilding of trust between developers and homebuyers. The forthcoming budget therefore presents an opportunity to reinforce stability, improve affordability, and sustain the growth trajectory that the sector has carefully built over the past few years.\n\nSustaining housing and urban development\n\nAt the centre of industry expectations lies continuity. Long-term housing and urban development programmes work best when predictable, allowing developers, investors, and state agencies to plan with clarity. Consistency in flagship initiatives related to housing, infrastructure, and urban rejuvenation supports better project planning and steady employment across construction and allied industries.\n\nReal estate’s multiplier effect—spanning cement, steel, logistics, interiors, and services—means sustained government backing has a ripple impact beyond the sector. A budget that reinforces continuity in these programmes would help maintain execution momentum and contribute to organised urban expansion.\n\nInfrastructure-equivalent status will unlock patient capital\n\nGranting housing “infrastructure-equivalent” status, along with tax rebates and incentives, would improve access to patient, long-tenure capital at lower financing costs. A stable policy framework would further enable developers, customers, and investors to structure funding and commit capital with confidence over the long term.\n\nEnhancing affordability through market-aligned incentives\n\nAffordability, however, remains the most delicate lever. Budgetary measures that enhance home-buying benefits, whether through interest-linked incentives or tax-related support, can meaningfully improve buyer confidence.\n\nImportantly, aligning housing incentives with current market realities would ensure that policy benefits remain relevant to today’s homebuyers rather than being constrained by outdated benchmarks. Such alignment can help bridge the gap between aspiration and access, particularly for first-time buyers.\n\nFurthermore, revision of affordable housing price capped at Rs 45 lakh is another key area that demands attention. Urban land and construction costs have evolved significantly over the past decade, and revisiting price thresholds to reflect present-day realities would allow more genuine end-users to qualify for benefits. For developers, this could encourage fresh project launches within the affordable and mid-income segments, improving supply where demand is structurally strong. A more contemporary definition of affordability would therefore support both homeownership and housing creation.\n\nGST rationalisation to ease cost pressures\n\nTaxation, particularly around construction inputs, continues to shape project viability in subtle but significant ways. Streamlining GST on construction-related items can help reduce cost pressures across the value chain, improve developer cash flows, and support timely project delivery. Over time, these efficiencies can lead to more competitive pricing for buyers while strengthening the financial health of projects. A simpler, more balanced tax framework would reinforce the sector’s ability to deliver at scale without compromising on quality or timelines.\n\nA budget that builds for the future\n\nWhat distinguishes the real estate sector today from its earlier cycles is its growing institutional character. Regulatory oversight has improved transparency, technology has reshaped transactions, and buyers are more informed than ever. From RERA-compliant disclosures to digital transaction platforms, the industry has embraced transformation. The upcoming budget can strengthen this evolution with progressive policy measures that focus on affordability, rationalisation and stability, while recognizing evolved market conditions and staying true to the vision of housing for all.\n\n(Vijay Wadhwa, Chairman,The Wadhwa Group.)\n\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication."

Retail investors continue to lead the numbers, having booked their reserved portion nearly 1.64 times so far despite falling GMP.\n\nThe initial public offering of the company received bids for 5.33 crore shares, as against an offer size of nearly 8.91 crore shares, according to data on NSE. Non Institutional Investors (NII) have booked 33 percent of the portion kept for them, while Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB) have subscribed 38 percent of their reserved portion.\n\nAhead of listing, the unlisted shares of Shadowfax Tech were trading with 0.81 percent grey market premium (GMP) over the IPO price, according to data on Investorgain. This is lower than the 8.06 percent GMP quoted by the site during the weekend, and 3.23 percent quoted yesterday.\n\nAccording to IPO Watch, the unlisted shares of the company were trading with 3.23 percent GMP over the IPO price.\n\nBengaluru-based technology-led logistics solutions provider Shadowfax Tech moved to the primary capital market to raise Rs 1,907.2 crore through its initial public offering (IPO), which comprises a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 1,000 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of shares worth Rs 907.2 crore by several investors including Flipkart, Eight Roads Investments, Qualcomm, and NewQuest Asia Fund.\n\nThe price band for the IPO has been set at Rs 118-124 per share. Investors can bid for a minimum of 120 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,160, and in multiples thereafter.\n\nThe IPO will remain open for public bidding between January 20 and January 22. The allotments are likely to be finalized by January 23, and the shares are scheduled to be listed on stock exchanges on January 28.\n\nHow will the IPO proceeds be used?\n\nThe company proposes to utilise proceeds from the fresh issue towards funding enhancing capacity in terms of network infrastructure, funding of lease payments for new first mile, last mile, and sort centres, as well as towards branding, marketing, and communication initiatives, unidentified inorganic acquisitions, and general corporate purposes.\n\nA day before the IPO opened for public bidding, Shadowfax announced that it has raised Rs 856.02 crore from 39anchor investorson January 19.\n\n\"Out of the total allocation, 3.67 crore equity shares worth Rs 455.73 crore were allocated to nine domestic mutual funds including ICICI Prudential AMC, Nippon Life India, Motilal Oswal AMC, Bandhan Mutual Fund, HSBC MF, Helios MF, JM Financial MF, and Trust Mutual Fund,\" Shadowfax Technologies in its filing to exchanges said.\n\nICICI Prudential AMC was the largest investor in the anchor book, acquiring 1.53 crore equity shares for Rs 190 crore through its four schemes - ICICI Prudential Flexicap Fund, ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage Fund, ICICI Prudential Transportation and Logistics Fund, and ICICI Prudential Exports and Services Fund.\n\nShould you apply for Shadowfax IPO?\n\nThe Indian logistics industry is entering a strong growth phase, driven by the rapid expansion of online retail and quick commerce, said Master Capital Services. It added that the industry is valued at Rs 21-23 trillion in FY2025, reflecting its scale and importance in supporting trade and consumption.\n\nOnline retail is the fastest growing channel in organized retail and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 20-25% from FY25 to FY30, the brokerage said, adding that within this, quick commerce is the fastest growing segment, expected to expand at an exceptional CAGR of 50-62% till FY30, highlighting rising consumer demand for faster and on-demand deliveries.\n\nE-commerce (excluding quick commerce) accounted for around 6% of the total Indian retail market in FY2025 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 15–20%, reaching a 9–10% market share by FY30, Master Capital Services said, adding that the number of online shoppers in India is also expected to grow at an 8–10% CAGR by FY30, providing a strong volume base for logistics services.\n\n“In this evolving landscape, Shadowfax Technologies Ltd is strategically positioned as a technology-led 3PL platform, enabling scalable, reliable, and time-sensitive logistics solutions across e-commerce, quick commerce, and hyperlocal delivery. With strong exposure to high-growth segments and a digital-first operating model, the company stands to benefit significantly from the structural growth of India’s logistics ecosystem. Investors may consider the IPO as a potential long-term investment opportunity,” the brokerage said.\n\nGaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk, noted that Shadowfax offers a compelling play on India’s rapidly growing e-commerce and quick-commerce ecosystem. \"With pan-India reach across over 14,700 pincodes and a client roster that includes Flipkart, Meesho, Swiggy, Zomato, and Blinkit, the company has demonstrated strong revenue growth (~32% CAGR FY23–25) and operational scalability through its large gig-based delivery network. Its asset-light model and EBITDA-positive performance since FY24 highlight its improving profitability trajectory,\" the analyst said.\n\nHe however cautioned that investors should be mindful of the risks and structural constraints. \"Margins remain thin, ROE and ROCE are modest, and revenue is concentrated with its top client contributing around 50%. At the upper price band, the IPO implies an EV/EBITDA of ~106x, which is rich compared with peers, suggesting that current valuations already reflect significant growth expectations,\" he said.\n\nOverall, Shadowfax offers long-term exposure to India’s logistics and hyperlocal delivery sector, but the IPO is better suited for investors with a long-term horizon, who are comfortable tracking execution, client diversification, and margin expansion over time, the analyst said. He added that for short-term listing gains, the risk-reward appears balanced but neutral."

        "full_content": "Indian stock markets have seen a sharp pullback from record highs. Both the Nifty 50 and Sensex have fallen over 4 percent in a week, unsettling many retail investors.\n\nThe Nifty 50 is down over 4 percent from its peak of 26,373.2, which it had hit on January 5, while the Sensex has fallen 4 percent from its high of 86,159.02 on December 1 last year. On January 20, the Nifty closed at 25,232, and the Sensex at 82,180, reflecting another day of losses in the market.\n\nAs markets turn volatile, a familiar question resurfaces: should you continue your SIPs or pause them until things settle down?\n\nFinancial advisors warn that this is exactly when most investors make costly mistakes when they stop SIPs, just as long-term wealth creation is about to take shape. Here’s why staying invested matters, and how to navigate SIPs during market corrections.\n\nLet’s explore the pitfalls, strategies, and mindset needed for SIP success.\n\nCommon reasons investors stop SIPs early\n\nMarket volatility tops the list, as short-term losses trigger fear and panic-selling during corrections, ignoring these are the very times when SIPs accumulate more units at lower prices.\n\nOther factors include comparing returns to trending assets or high-performing funds, cash-flow issues from job changes or expenses, and a lack of initial conviction about market cycles.\n\nLt Col Rochak Bakshi (retired), founder of True North Finance, a financial and investment planning firm said, “Recency bias, where investors chase recent highs, and loss aversion further exacerbate this, treating SIPs like short-term trades rather than disciplined investments. As a result, many exit just before the wealth-building phase begins.”\n\nThe High Cost of Quitting: Eroding gains through missed compounding\n\nQuitting early deprives investors of rupee-cost averaging in downturns and the compounding effect, which ramps up after 7-10 years. “SIPs thrive on time, not timing; early exits turn them into mediocre savings tools, locking in losses and forfeiting future growth,” said Vijay Maheshwari, founder of Stocktick Capital.\n\nConsider a Rs 75,000 monthly SIP at 15 percent CAGR: After 3 years, the total investment of Rs 27 lakhs yields Rs 34 lakhs, but continuing to 20 years builds Rs 9.97 crore on Rs 1.8 crore invested. Stopping at 3 years means an opportunity loss of Rs 9.63 crore; even stopping at 10 years (Rs 2 crore corpus), it's Rs 7.97 crore forgone.\n\n“Wealth creation is back-loaded—the first 7 years build a base, years 8-14 gain momentum, and the final phase explodes due to compounding on a larger sum. No timing or luck is needed; consistency alone drives this,” said Maheshwari.\n\nFor instance, a Rs 5,000 monthly SIP with 10 percent annual step-up and 12 percent returns grows to Rs 1.08 crore in 21 years. The investment phases show slow growth initially (Rs 8.37 lakh in 7 years), building momentum (Rs 34.81 lakh in 14 years), and exponential growth in the final phase (Rs 1.08 crore in 21 years).\n\nBoosting outcomes with step-up SIPs\n\nA step-up SIP increases contributions annually. For instance, for a Rs 5,000 starting SIP over 15 years at 12 percent returns, a conventional plan invests Rs 9 lakh for Rs 24 lakh maturity, while a 10 percent step-up invests Rs 15.3 lakh for Rs 36 lakh, a 50 percent boost.\n\nIdeal for salaried professionals or young earners, it suits late starters (e.g., age 45 with Rs 10,000 starting and 15 percent annual increase, yielding Rs 90 lakhs in 15 years) or those with small initial amounts.\n\n“However, it's unsuitable for self-employed individuals with inconsistent cash flows. Start in mid-30s when finances stabilize for maximum impact,” said Bakshi.\n\nAlso read |How NPS contributions cut your income tax under both old and new regimes\n\nPsychological barriers and advisor strategies\n\nImpatience for quick gains, especially in sideways markets, leads to exit within five years, as early modest returns erode confidence.\n\nSIP is a long-term concept and starts showing results only after 7 to 10 years. Most investors don't have the patience to stick to the process. “Frequent comparison with peers, market indices, or recently outperforming funds further weakens conviction and encourages premature exits,” said Maheshwari.\n\n“Successful SIP investing needs the investor to appreciate delayed gratification, which is a rare quality,” said Bakshi.\n\nAdvisors counter this by setting realistic expectations, explaining back-loaded returns, and communicating during dips to reframe them as opportunities.\n\nGoal-based planning ties investments to milestones like education or retirement, reducing short-term focus. “Automated step-ups, periodic reviews, and a behavioral guidance-based approach with hand-holding build discipline and prevent errors,” said Maheshwari.\n\nElements for turning SIPs into extraordinary wealth\n\nBeyond consistency, start early for exponential compounding, where later years generate most wealth. Gradually step up contributions, maintain asset allocation through rebalancing, and select quality funds with strong philosophies and risk management.\n\n“Uphold behavioral discipline by ignoring market noise, ensure cost and tax efficiency, and review portfolios regularly to align with goals,” said Maheshwari. These amplify outcomes without chasing high-risk returns.\n\nAlso read |Here is how to invest smartly if you earn Rs 1 lakh a month\n\nBuilding patience in volatile markets\n\nFor beginners, advisors recommend linking SIPs to goals (like buying a house) rather than focusing on returns, to handle market ups and downs. Automate investments, limit reviews to annually, and view volatility as a chance to buy low. Gradually increase amounts via step-ups, stay informed via credible sources without obsession, and remember compounding rewards endurance, not speed."

In commercial property terms, a 'warm shell' property indicates that it has basic requirements in place, such as air conditioning, some electrical fittings, completed floors and ceilings, and lighting.\n\nL&T Realty said in a statement that the property will include a single tower, with 28 office floors, a ground floor, basement, and six podium floors. The offices are expected to have floor plates of around 14,000 square feet each.\n\nThe Lower Parel-Prabhadevi belt is one of the most sought-after markets for major corporates, large, strategic facilities, including their headquarters, especially for the banking, financial services, insurance (BFSI) sector, players in the manufacturing and pharmaceutical segments, as well as for professional services networks and major law firms.\n\nOffice rentals have significantly increased over the past two years due to a persistent shortage, with monthly rentals for Grade-A office spaces trading at more than Rs 250 per square foot.\n\nThe company, which is headed for a public listing over the next two years, said that it is aiming for the corporate and BFSI sectors in the new tower, with the location also seeing major infrastructure development to improve access.\n\n\"The L&T Realty Innovation Campus at Lower Parel has been envisioned as a future-ready workplace. Tapping into the BFSI micro-market of Lower Parel in the financial capital of the country, this development enjoys a central position with strong corporate presence, unparalleled connectivity, robust social infrastructure, and ease of access to premium residential catchments,\" said Anupam Kumar, CEO and managing director, L&T Realty.\n\nAnupam added that the property has a construction timeline of around 36 months, and has the potential to bring in significant annuity income for the company."

        "full_content": "After sharp price gains across top cities for the past two years, India’s residential property market is entering 2026 with prices expected to stabilise, though the risk of a slowdown in select markets remains.\n\nHome prices rose at their fastest pace in years through 2025 because of strong end-user demand, tight inventory in prime micro-markets, rising construction and land costs, and sustained appetite for premium and luxury housing.\n\nIndustry experts said 2026 is unlikely to see a repeat of last year’s sharp price escalation. Instead, the market is expected to transition into a phase of calibrated growth, with pricing becoming increasingly micro-market and segment specific.\n\nThey said property price growth is expected to moderate after sharp gains across major cities such as Noida, Gurugram, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune in previous years.\n\nResidential sales, which rebounded sharply after the pandemic, have moderated in recent quarters alongside a weaker domestic equity market. Real estate developerSignature Global (India) Ltdearlier this month said it might not meet its sales guidance for the current fiscal, citing softer demand conditions.\n\nAnalysts said that the slowdown is expected to extend to other listed developers as well. Nomura Securities projects a 92 percent fall inDLF’s pre-sales and a 43 percent decline forOberoi Realty. Analysts said that housing demand in Gurugram and Noida could soften amid elevated prices and a slowdown in new project launches.\n\nAccording to the CREDAI-CREMatrix Developer Sentiment Survey 2026, most developers expect residential prices to either stabilise or grow at a slower pace this year, with demand holding firm but becoming more value-conscious. The survey also points towards a moderation in property price hikes rather than more cautious buyer behaviour.\n\n“The market has absorbed a lot of price increase over the last 18–24 months. In 2026, buyers are more discerning. They are still willing to pay a premium—but only for the right location, connectivity and product quality. We are clearly seeing a shift from aggressive pricing to strategic pricing,” said Sandeep Chhillar, Founder & Chairman, Landmark Group.\n\nCity wise trends point to divergence rather than a uniform slowdown. Market observers said that Delhi-NCR remains one of the strongest markets, driven by infrastructure projects such as the Dwarka Expressway, Noida International Airport and metro expansions.\n\nHowever, affordability pressures are beginning to temper demand in peripheral micro-markets where prices have risen faster than income growth.\n\nSehaj Chawla, Managing Director, TREVOC Group said that demand remains resilient in well-connected corridors where infrastructure delivery is clearly visible.\n\n“Across NCR and other metros, price appreciation in 2026 is expected to become more calibrated. Projects at well-connected locations will attract greater traction,” he added.\n\nMumbai continues to see resilience in premium and redevelopment-led supply, though mid-segment buyers are increasingly price-sensitive. Experts said that Bengaluru and Hyderabad are witnessing steady absorption, supported by technology-sector employment, but price growth is expected to moderate as new supply comes on stream. Pune and Chennai are likely to remain end-user-driven, with limited speculative activity, they said.\n\nDevelopers recalibrate strategies\n\nMarket observers said that developers are recalibrating strategies in 2026 due to slow momentum.\n\nAmit Modi, Director, County Group, said that affordability has become a key conversation again, so instead of chasing headline price hikes, developers are focusing on optimising unit sizes, introducing flexible payment plans, and phasing launches to align with demand absorption.\n\n“Developers are responding by fine-tuning product mix, more efficient homes, fewer speculative launches, and sharper pricing discipline. The objective is volume-led growth rather than aggressive appreciation,” he added.\n\nCREDAI-CRE Matrix survey echoes this trend, indicating that developers are prioritising execution and cash-flow visibility over rapid expansion. New launches are increasingly concentrated in established micro-markets with proven demand rather than peripheral locations.\n\nIndustry watchers anticipate that 2026 will test the market’s ability to sustain demand without relying solely on price momentum. Interest rates are expected to remain largely stable, supporting housing demand, but affordability constraints will cap sharp upside.\n\nChawla of TREVOC Group said the next phase of growth would be driven less by speculation and more by fundamentals. “Markets with infrastructure, employment visibility and quality supply will continue to perform,” he said."

        "full_content": "Ahead of the Union Budget, real estate stakeholders have called for tax reforms and greater government funding, particularly through the expansion of Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing (SWAMIH) Fund.\n\nTargeted fiscal measures are critical to sustaining housing demand, reviving stalled projects and aligning policy with current market realities, industry leaders have said.\n\nIndustry body the National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO) has stressed for the need for deeper financial support to unlock real estate-led growth through schemes such as SWAMIH Fund.\n\nIndustry stakeholders also highlighted the need to increase the homeloaninterest deduction limit from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. Additional interest subsidies and reduction in GST would provide a much-needed boost to affordable housing, they said.\n\nLaunched in 2019 with an initial corpus of Rs 25,000 crore, the SWAMIH Fund was created to provide last-mile financing to stalled residential projects and protect homebuyers stuck in delayed developments.\n\nSince inception, SWAMIH Fund-I has sanctioned investments in over 130 stalled projects across India, helping revive nearly one lakh housing units, according to government disclosures. Of these, tens of thousands of homes have already been completed and delivered in stressed markets such as NCR, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune.\n\n“We urge the government to accord infrastructure status to the real estate sector, extend and expand the SWAMIH Fund, improve credit access for developers, rationalise GST on under-construction housing, and provide incentives for first-time homebuyers and rental housing,” NAREDCO president Parveen Jain.\n\nHe added that sustained investment in urban infrastructure and a sharper focus on tier 2 and 3 cities could significantly enhance demand, buyer confidence and the sector’s contribution to GDP and employment.\n\nTax reforms key to affordability and ‘Housing for All’\n\nTax policy reforms are another major expectation from the upcoming budget, especially as affordability pressures intensify in urban markets.\n\nAnita Basrur, Partner at Sudit K Parekh and Co. LLP, said the government’s “Housing for All” vision under schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) requires urgent recalibration of tax thresholds.\n\n“With inflation, land prices and construction costs rising, the current affordable housing cap of Rs 45 lakh and size limits of 60–90 square metres no longer reflect urban realities,” Basrur said.\n\nShe called for reducing GST on housing projects, increasing the home loan interest deduction limit from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, and offering interest subsidies for first-time buyers.\n\nBasrur also suggested enhancing capital gains reinvestment limits and streamlining approvals through a single-window clearance mechanism to boost the sector.\n\nDevelopers, particularly in the premium and branded housing segments, are seeking consistency in taxation and improved access to institutional financing to sustain investor confidence.\n\n“The real estate sector eagerly anticipates policies that bolster long-term capital formation and reinforce housing’s pivotal role in economic growth,” said Anil Mittal, chief financial officer, Smartworld Developers.\n\nContinued investment in urban infrastructure, mass mobility and integrated city planning is critical, as improved connectivity and civic amenities directly enhance the appeal of residential developments.\n\nIndia Sotheby’s International Realty managing director Amit Goyal said for the housing momentum to sustain, buoyancy in the equity markets and foreign capital inflows must remain buoyant. “It is imperative for the budget to announce measures that will encourage more FDI (foreign direct investments) into the country,” he said.\n\nManish Agarwal, Managing Director (Satya Group) and President, CREDAI Haryana, said that as the Budget approaches, developers urge the government to introduce forward-looking policy interventions that pair exclusivity with financial agility.\n\n\"In particular, incentivising fractional ownership could be a gamechanger for the marquee asset class. By aligning fiscal policy with these evolving market dynamics, India can move beyond property development to build a resilient, world-class luxury ecosystem that competes effectively on the global stage,\" he said."

        "full_content": "India’s subdued equity markets and volatile investor sentiment are beginning to weigh on the country’s real estate sector, particularly in the mid-income and premium-housing segments, as developers report slower sales momentum and cautious buyer behaviour.\n\nAfter a strong post-pandemic recovery, residential sales have shown signs of moderation in recent quarters, mirroring the lacklustre performance of domestic stock markets. Market observers say prolonged volatility in equities, limited wealth creation and a wait-and-watch approach among investors have dampened discretionary property purchases, especially from high-value and investor-driven segments.\n\nThe impact is becoming visible in developer guidance. Signature Global (India) Ltd, a key player in the mid-income and premium housing segment, earlier this month indicated that it might not be able to meet its sales guidance for the current fiscal, citing softer demand conditions.\n\nAnalysts have viewed the company’s commentary as an early signal of broader stress in parts of the residential market. They say housing demand in Gurugram could soften amid elevated prices and a slowdown in new project launches.\n\nThe trend is not limited to Signature Global as other major listed developers such asDLFandOberoi Realty, are also expected to report weaker pre-sales. Nomura Securities, in its latest note, projects a steep 92 percent drop in pre-sales for DLF, while Oberoi Realty is estimated to see a 43 percent decline.\n\n“Real estate demand in urban markets is closely linked to financial market sentiment. When equity markets underperform or remain range-bound, buyers tend to defer large-ticket purchases like homes,” a Delhi-NCR-based real estate consultant said on condition of anonymity.\n\nNuvama Institutional Equities said the frenzy that has characterised the Gurugram market over the past few years is now ebbing. The brokerage expects a rationalisation in new launches, pre‑sales momentum and the pace of price appreciation in the city going forward.\n\nIndustry experts note that while end-user demand remains relatively stable, especially in affordable housing, investor-led demand has weakened amid uncertain capital market returns. High interest rates, elevated property prices in key urban centres and muted income growth have further added to buyer caution.\n\n“Stock market performance plays a significant role in driving confidence, particularly among repeat buyers and investors. With limited upside in equities, capital allocation to real estate has slowed,” an analyst with a real estate advisory firm said.\n\nThe slowdown is more pronounced in markets such as Gurugram where prices have risen sharply over the past two to three years, making affordability a growing concern. Developers are increasingly relying on festive offers, flexible payment plans and selective price corrections to sustain sales velocity.\n\nHowever, the impact has not been uniform across the sector. Prime housing in select micro-markets and well-located affordable projects continues to see steady traction, driven by genuine end-users. Commercial real estate, particularly office leasing, has also remained resilient, offering some cushion to developers with diversified portfolios.\n\nMarket observers said immediate outright price cut would not be happening, however, builders might start recalibrating their strategies to align with current demand realities.\n\n“Outright price cuts remain unlikely as elevated construction and land costs limit the scope for base price reductions. Instead, developers are relying on payment flexibility, limited-period incentives, and stamp-duty support to help buyer conversions,” said, Ashish Narain Agarwal, Founder and MD of PropertyPistol, a Mumbai-based real estate consultancy firm.\n\nHe said in more affordability-stretched micro-markets, launches are being deferred and sales targets moderated by developers as part of their strategies to tackle the situation.\n\n“Many developers are focusing on phased launches and sell-through efficiency, rather than chasing volumes,” Agarwal said.\n\nIndustry stakeholders believe that a revival in equity markets, coupled with softer interest rates and policy support, will be crucial to restoring buyer confidence. Until then, developers may need to recalibrate growth expectations and focus on execution and balance-sheet strength rather than aggressive sales targets."

        "full_content": "Gurugram emerged as one of India’s biggest magnets for real estate investment in 2025, with projects worth Rs 86,588 crore receiving regulatory approvals during the year, according to Gurugram Real Estate Regulatory Authority (Gurugram RERA).\n\nMarket observers said that these estimates underscore strong investor appetite for the NCR’s largest commercial and residential hub.\n\nData released by the Gurugram RERA shows that 131 projects were registered in calendar year 2025, translating into development potential of 35,455 units across housing and commercial segments.\n\nNotably, just 28 large projects accounted for investments of Rs 59,360 crore, highlighting the growing role of big-ticket capital and large developers in shaping the city’s real estate landscape, the Authority data showed.\n\nData showed that the residential assets continued to attract the bulk of investments. Of the total units approved, 31,455 were residential, reflecting sustained end-user demand as well as investor confidence in Gurugram’s long-term housing fundamentals.\n\n“The residential mix was spread across categories, with 17,405 group housing units, 5,720 mixed land use units, 4,040 residential floor units, 2,122 affordable group housing units, 1,954 units under the Deen Dayal housing scheme, and 214 residential plotted colony units,” the Authority data showed.\n\nMarket observers said this diversified pipeline indicates that capital is being deployed across both premium and mass segments, reducing concentration risk and improving the depth of the market.\n\nAuthority officials said that of the 4,000 commercial units approved during the year, 168 units were dedicated to IT parks, reinforcing Gurugram’s status as a preferred destination for technology firms and Global Capability Centres.\n\nAnalysts said the combination of office-led employment growth and residential development continues to make Gurugram attractive for long-term capital deployment.\n\nIndustry experts said that the scale of investments approved in 2025 reflects Gurugram’s ability to attract capital even amid global uncertainty, driven by infrastructure expansion, strong corporate presence, and a more robust regulatory framework.\n\n“With a large pipeline of approved projects and continued interest from developers and institutional investors, Gurugram is expected to remain a key investment destination within India’s real estate market in the coming years,” a Gurugram-based real estate expert said.\n\nAuthority officials said that alongside rising investment volumes, Gurugram RERA implemented tighter regulatory checks to improve transparency and protect investor and homebuyer interests.\n\n“These steps included enhanced scrutiny of developer submissions, mandatory site inspections by domain experts, and the introduction of public consultation through mandatory public notices before project registration,” an official said.\n\nAmlan Dutta, VP Sales and Strategy, Trehan Iris, said, that Gurugram’s clearance of 131 projects in 2025 marks a remarkable momentum for the sector, reflecting strong investor confidence and a renewed sense of market optimism.\n\n“RERA’s transparent and well-structured framework has played a pivotal role in driving this growth by empowering developers with greater planning certainty, smoother access to capital and the confidence to deliver high-quality projects on time. By promoting accountability and minimizing ambiguity, RERA safeguards buyer interests while simultaneously enhancing developer credibility,” he said.\n\nSudeep Bhatt, Director Strategy, Whiteland Corporation, said that regulatory reforms under RERA have been a key stimulus, bringing in greater transparency through strict compliance norms, mandatory site inspections and continuous project monitoring.\n\n“This has strengthened trust among HNIs and NRIs, leading to growing NRI participation and rising Indian global clout in real estate investments,” he said."

        "full_content": "In 2025, India’s real estate market will be remembered for extremes. Luxury apartments are selling fast, premium prices are easily absorbed, and developers’ balance sheets are stronger than ever. However, beneath this success lies a troubling contradiction: affordable housing—the backbone of urban India—is quietly disappearing. This isn’t a demand crisis but a crisis rooted in economics, policy design, and misaligned incentives.\n\nRecent market data paints a stark picture. Knight Frank India reports that the supply-to-demand ratio for homes priced below ₹50 lakhs has collapsed to 0.36 in the first half of 2025, down from a balanced 1.05 in 2019. In simpler terms, for every 100 affordable homes demanded, only 36 are being supplied.\n\nThe shift in developer focus is dramatic. Affordable housing accounted for over half of new residential launches in 2018; today, it represents just 17%. Sales in this segment have dropped nearly 17% year-on-year, even as luxury housing records its fastest-ever absorption rates. The paradox is evident: premium projects are selling quickly, yet unsold high-ticket inventory piles up. Meanwhile, lower- and middle-income households find homeownership increasingly unattainable. The market is oversupplying where demand is limited and undersupplying where it is structurally deep.\n\nWhy Developers Are Walking Away\n\nThe lack of affordable housing supply isn’t due to a lack of intent by developers. It’s primarily driven by razor-thin margins and unviable economics. Rising construction costs—cement, steel, labour, compliance, and most notably, urban land prices—have outpaced the growth of lower-income household incomes. Affordable housing, by definition, operates on tight margins, whereas luxury housing doesn’t.\n\nFor developers, the decision is clear: premium projects offer larger margins and pricing flexibility. In contrast, even small cost increases in affordable housing can wipe out profitability. Geography further complicates matters. Affordable land is usually available on city peripheries, but these areas often lack sufficient transport, social infrastructure, and employment opportunities. Consequently, developers find it difficult to make projects financially viable—either land in the city is too expensive, or peripheral areas are too disconnected.\n\nThere’s a growing narrative that housing affordability has improved. Mumbai’s EMI-to-income ratio, for example, has dropped below 50%, now sitting at around 47%. This decline is attributed to lower interest rates and stable income growth. But this statistic hides the true barrier to homeownership for lower-middle-income households. The real challenge isn’t just the monthly EMI but the high upfront costs—down payments, stamp duty, registration charges, and rising property prices—making homeownership increasingly out of reach.\n\nMoreover, a significant portion of the affordable housing target audience is self-employed or earns informal income. Traditional banking requirements, such as salary slips, formal credit histories, and tax returns, exclude many genuine buyers from institutional financing. So, while demand exists, access does not.\n\nAt the heart of the issue lies a disconnect between policy intentions and market realities. The government’s commitment to “Housing for All” remains clear, and initiatives such as PMAY 2.0 reflect that vision. However, the frameworks governing taxation and incentives have not evolved to match rising costs.\n\nTake the current GST regime: residential housing is split into two categories—“affordable” projects taxed at 1% and all others taxed at 5%. To qualify as affordable, a home must cost less than ₹45 lakhs and meet strict size limits. These thresholds were set in 2017, and in 2026, they are outdated. Industry bodies, such as CREDAI, have proposed raising the affordability threshold to ₹90 lakhs, which would reflect current land and construction costs. Additionally, the legal definition of “affordable” should reflect the distinct price and cost dynamics between rural and urban areas.\n\nA major issue within the existing framework is that residential real estate developers cannot claim input tax credits, unlike other industries. Although GST on cement and tiles has been reduced, developers can’t offset these taxes against the GST collected from buyers. As a result, the 1% tax rate on affordable housing doesn’t account for input taxes embedded in construction costs, leading to a cascading tax effect. This hidden tax burden inflates prices, undermining the very goal of affordable housing. Allowing input tax credits for affordable projects or reducing GST on works contracts would directly reduce construction costs and make housing more affordable.\n\nThe Case for Direct Tax Incentives\n\nTo level the playing field, income tax incentives are essential. The reintroduction of Section 80-IBA of the Income Tax Act, which previously offered a 100% tax holiday on profits from affordable housing projects, could boost supply once again. However, the section had limitations, including a project life cap of five years, which is too short for the nature of the industry.\n\nTo revitalise affordable housing, Section 80-IBA could be revamped by:\n\nAdditionally, the ₹2 lakh cap on homeloaninterest deductions has become outdated. Raising this cap to ₹5 lakhs would offer immediate relief to families struggling with high EMIs.\n\nFurther, employers could be incentivised to build industrial and employee housing through higher depreciation allowances on employee residences. This would address migrant housing shortages while reducing pressure on urban slums.\n\nState governments and local authorities hold significant power to promote affordable housing through stamp duty and registration charge reductions. Currently, these high charges act as an additional burden on lower- and middle-income households. By reducing these rates for affordable housing projects, immediate relief could be provided.\n\nA responsive regulatory environment that speeds up approvals and reduces red tape can also make projects more viable. Urban development policy should align private and public interests, for example, by offering higher Floor Space Index (FSI) in prime locations for affordable housing projects.\n\nAffordable housing can’t be solved in isolation. Urban congestion, job concentration, and land scarcity are interconnected challenges. Long-term strategies must include economic decentralisation, satellite city development, and employment-linked housing incentives.\n\nLand is finite, and housing demand is perpetual. The affordable housing crisis is not inevitable. It’s a result of outdated definitions, mismatched policies, and tax distortions. By recalibrating what “affordable” truly means in 2026 and addressing the fiscal paradox developers face, India can restore balance to its housing market. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of “Housing for All” can once again become a reality, both socially and commercially, with the right structural reforms.\n\n(Deepesh Chheda is Partner, Dhruva Advisors.)\n\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication."

        "full_content": "Noida, once known for offering affordable housing for the salaried middle class in the National Capital Region (NCR), is now becoming a hub for high-end residential developments, including branded residences by top hospitality, lifestyle and luxury brands.\n\nDriven by expanding job opportunities, infrastructure growth, rising wealth, and evolving buyer aspirations, the city is swiftly developing into a luxury and branded-residence destination, attracting high-net-worth individuals (HNIs), non-resident Indians (NRIs) and entrepreneurial buyers who once focused primarily on Mumbai, Delhi and Gurugram.\n\nBranded residences take centre stage\n\nNoida has seen a string of branded residences by Gulshan Group, M3M India and Smartworld Developers. In October 2025, M3M India collaborated with global luxury jewellery and watches brand Jacob & Co. to launch M3M-Jacob & Co Residences.\n\nSimilarly, in December, the Indian Hotels Company Ltd (IHCL), the owner of Taj Hotels, has collaborated with Noida-based realty firm Gulshan Group to develop a Taj hotel and Taj Branded Serviced Apartments in Noida’s Sector 129 along the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway.\n\nAlso Read: From Trump Towers to Jacob & Co, branded residences lead India’s luxury housing wave\n\nJoining the league of branded residences, Smartworld Developers has collaborated with Lebanon-based fashion designer and lifestyle brand, Elie Saab, for another branded residence project in Sector 98 in Noida. Besides these, M3M India is also planning to launch Trump-branded residences in Noida.\n\nThe apartments in these branded residences in Noida typically range from Rs 9 crore to Rs 25 crore, depending on their size, location, and the brand.\n\nMarket observers said that these high-end property launches mark a departure from Noida’s traditional product mix, where housing was largely driven by mid-income segments. Developers are now focusing on differentiated offerings tailored to luxury, lifestyle and brand-conscious buyers.\n\nDevelopers and market analysts said that the primary buyers of Noida’s luxury and branded residences include HNIs, NRIs, corporates, entrepreneurs from tier-1 and 2 cities, and some celebrities.\n\nYukti Nagpal, Director, Gulshan Group, said that buyers of high-end apartments are CXO-level professionals, entrepreneurs, and NRIs seeking space, comfort, and long-term value.\n\n“Compared to Mumbai, Delhi, or Gurugram, Noida still offers larger homes and better value, which is increasingly influencing premium homebuyer decisions,” she said.\n\nPankaj Bansal, the owner of M3M India and founder of Smartworld Developers, said buyers are largely people who have arrived in their lives and want their presence to be felt.\n\n“Either these people have a lot of money, or they are famous in the area they operate. The second category is the wealthy people who want to move from tier-2 cities to tier-1 cities. They want their second generation to live in tier-1 cities. The third ones are the CEOs and CFOs of large multinational companies,” he said.\n\nVishal Raheja, Founder and Managing Director, InvestoXpert Advisors, said that investment motivation plays an equally strong role in the purchase of such properties.\n\n\"NRIs and strategic investors are also actively acquiring premium residences driven by strong capital appreciation potential, attractive rental yields in prime business corridors, and limited high-quality inventory that ensures sustained resale value,” he said.\n\nRaheja added that an emerging segment of younger, affluent professionals and dual-income households in tech, finance, and services also prefer to buy branded properties as they seek exclusivity, security, wellness and globally benchmarked amenities.\n\nKey factors driving growth of luxury or branded residences\n\nAshish Narain Agarwal, the founder and Managing Director of PropertyPistol, a real estate consultant, said that infrastructure development, strategic urban planning, expanding expressways, metro connectivity, and proximity to the upcoming Noida International Airport are fueling Noida’s transformation.\n\nAlso Read: M3M–Jacob & Co branded 5BHK residences sell out at Rs 40,000 per sq ft in Noida — highest-ever rate for the city\n\nStrong corporate growth driven by IT parks, industrial corridors, and global capability centres (GCC) has created a high-income working population seeking premium lifestyle housing.\n\n“Alongside this, growing demand for modern amenities, wellness-led environments, security, and branded living experiences has encouraged developers to introduce world-class luxury offerings. As a result, Noida is evolving from a functional residential zone into a sophisticated luxury destination offering global-standard living, lifestyle convenience, and strong investment prospects,” he said.\n\nRavi Nirwal, Principal Partner and Sales Director, Square Yards, said that the availability of large, contiguous land parcels in Noida has allowed developers to plan integrated, low-density projects with premium amenities, which is often difficult in more saturated markets.\n\nComparison of Noida with Mumbai, Delhi, and Gurugram\n\nRaheja of InvestoXperts said that Noida today stands out as one of India’s most competitive premium real estate destinations, offering a balance of affordability, lifestyle excellence, and future-ready infrastructure.\n\nAccording to data from InvestoXpert, property prices in Noida typically range between Rs 9,000 – Rs 15,000 per sqft, with ultra-luxury developments oscillating between Rs 15,000 – Rs 40,000 per sq ft, compared with Delhi-NCR’s regional luxury average of Rs 23,000 per sq ft.\n\nAverage pricing in Gurugram ranges between Rs 20,000 and Rs 37,000 per sq ft in premium corridors, while Mumbai’s average pricing is significantly higher, from Rs 40,000 per sq ft to over Rs 100,000 in marquee micro-markets.\n\nUnlike Mumbai, where ultra luxury is often defined by scarcity and location, or central Delhi, where legacy and exclusivity play a major role, Noida’s premium offerings are more focused on scale, modern infrastructure and planned development, said Nirwal of Square Yards.\n\n“When compared to Gurugram, which has a more mature luxury ecosystem and proximity to corporate headquarters, Noida is emerging as an alternative for buyers prioritising newer infrastructure and comparatively competitive pricing,” he said."

        "full_content": "As the Union Budget 2026 draws near, India’s real estate sector has urged the government to grant the sector an industry status, digitise land records and introduce a simplified single-window clearance mechanism to accelerate approvals and revive demand.\n\nIndustry bodies and developers argue that recognising real estate as an “industry” would unlock cheaper long-term institutional credit, lower borrowing costs and broader access to structured financing.\n\nDevelopers said that industry status has been a long-pending demand and they remain optimistic, expecting sustained policy support in the budget.\n\n“The real estate sector currently contributes around 7 percent to India’s GDP and supports over 200 allied industries. Granting industry status to real estate sector would improve access to institutional funding and enable the sector to play a stronger role in job creation and economic growth. Real estate has the potential to contribute up to 15 percent to India’s GDP by 2047 with the help of adequate policy support,”Signature Global (India) Ltdfounder and chairman Pradeep Aggarwal has said.\n\nTribeca Developers group CEO Rajat Khandelwal said the sector is looking for policy continuity that supports both supply and demand. “Granting industry status to real estate remains crucial, as it would ease access to long-term capital; lower borrowing costs, and improve execution efficiency for developers,” he said.\n\nKhandelwal said real estate growth is closely tied to infrastructure. Increased investments in urban infrastructure, public transport and smart city initiatives will not only make cities liveable but also strengthen the realty sector.\n\nSterling Developers chairman and managing director Ramani Sastri said industry status will help the real estate sector realise its full potential, as it will unlock affordable funding and streamline regulatory processes.\n\n“Overall, we would like to see announcements to enhance ease of doing business for the developers to create positive climate for real estate investment,” he said.\n\nSingle-window clearance and digitisation of land records\n\nDevelopers have also sought single-window clearances, consolidating approvals from multiple authorities on a unified digital platform. It will cut the red tape, reduce project gestation periods and enhance transparency, they have argued.\n\nTRG Group MD Shorab Upadhyay said realtors are looking forward to a Union Budget that brings in stability, liquidity and confidence in the real estate sector.\n\n“We expect better policy support towards faster project approvals, single-window clearances, and digitisation of land records, which are much-needed steps in substantially enhancing ease of doing business and accelerating delivery timelines,” he said.\n\nNotandas Realty managing director  Harsh Jagwani said a single-window clearance system is “long overdue” and capable of accelerating approvals and injecting much-needed efficiency into project execution.\n\nThe government should also bring reforms in the digitisation process of land as well as property acquisition. “This will not only help in accelerating the pace of development of new projects but also ease the process of buying new homes for homebuyers in general. Cleaner land-title system, stricter escrow enforcement under RERA will also help reduce transaction risk and financing delays,” he said."

        "full_content": "For thousands of homebuyers who have spent over a decade paying EMIs without possession, a long-awaited turning point may finally be in sight at Jaypee’s Wish Town in Noida.\n\nSuraksha Group, which took over debt-laden Jaypee Infratech Ltd (JIL) through the insolvency process in 2024, has completed construction of 5,989 residential units spread across 63 towers.\n\nThe company has secured Occupancy Certificates (OCs) for 3,135 units across 31 towers, clearing the way for possession and registrations to begin for a significant chunk of stranded buyers. Another 2,854 units across 32 towers are awaiting regulatory approvals, with the developer saying OCs are expected over the next few months.\n\nRelief for buyers stuck in limbo\n\nFor buyers who have been paying homeloanEMIs without possession for years, the issuance of OCs is the first concrete sign that homes may finally be handed over.\n\n“Construction completion is important, but for us the real relief comes only when OCs are issued and possession starts,” said a homebuyer from the Kosmos project, who booked the apartment in 2012.\n\nJaypee Infratech was admitted to insolvency in 2017, leaving more than 20,000 homebuyers across its Noida and Greater Noida projects in limbo. After multiple failed resolution attempts, Suraksha Group took over the company in 2024, promising time-bound delivery under a court-approved resolution plan.\n\nAnother homebuyer and a representative of a Kensington Park homebuyers’ group said that they have seen promises earlier too, so buyers are cautiously optimistic.\n\n“Receiving OCs for 31 towers is a positive development, but the real test will be timely handover, completion of common facilities, and basic services like water and power,” he asserted.\n\nProjects cleared, more awaiting approvals\n\nThe towers that have received OCs are spread across projects including JP Kosmos, Klassic, Kensington Boulevard Apartments, and Kensington Park Apartments and Heights, covering 3,135 units.\n\nJash Panchamia, Executive Director at Jaypee Infratech Ltd, said that 63 towers have been completed and OCs have already been received for 31 towers. He said that the company expects OCs for another 32 towers over the next couple of months.\n\nHe said that construction on the remaining towers is progressing and deliveries would be aligned with timelines laid out under the resolution framework.\n\n“Despite crippling restrictions imposed on construction activities due to GRAP rules during winter months every year, we remain fully committed to fulfilling our customers’ expectations and delivering as per the resolution plan,” Panchamia said.\n\nBuyers, however, said that regulatory approvals are critical not only for possession but also for financial closure. “Without an OC, banks don’t allow us to complete registration, and we remain stuck paying EMIs and rent simultaneously. Even a few months’ delay has a real financial impact on families,” said a buyer from the Klassic project."

        "full_content": "Inflows into mid-cap and small-cap mutual fund schemes touched record levels in 2025 despite sharp volatility in broader markets, the absence of foreign investors from these segments, stretched valuations, and muted earnings.\n\nAMFI data showed that mid-cap schemes received Rs 49,939 crore during the year, up 46 percent from a year earlier, while small-cap schemes attracted Rs 52,321 crore, an increase of 53 percent.\n\nMarket performance remained mixed during the period. The BSE MidCap index rose 1.1 percent in 2025, while the BSE SmallCap index declined 6.6 percent. In comparison, the Sensex and Nifty gained nearly 9 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively.\n\nAxis Securities’ Rajesh Palviya said the inflows were supported by steady SIP investments and investors continuing to add to their mutual fund holdings, based on the strong three-year and five-year outperformance of mid-cap and small-cap stocks over large-cap shares.\n\nMarket breadth stayed weak. Of the 140 stocks in the BSE MidCap index, 86 ended the year with negative returns, while in the BSE SmallCap index, 871 of the 1,186 stocks were in the red. In the BSE100 index, 61 stocks posted gains and 39 recorded losses.\n\nPalviya said investors have been using market declines to average their investments, as SIP inflows into mid-cap and small-cap schemes continue on a regular basis.\n\nDomestic investors have been the main source of net inflows over the past two years and have preferred mid-cap and small-cap schemes over large-cap funds. Foreign investors have largely stayed away from these segments and have mainly been selling large-cap stocks, which has further concentrated domestic flows into mid-cap and small-cap schemes.\n\nThe share of mid-cap and small-cap schemes in total equity inflows also increased during the year. Mid-cap funds accounted for a record 14.26 percent of total equity inflows, up from 8.7 percent in 2024 and 14.18 percent in 2023. Small-cap funds also saw their share rise to a two-year high of 14.26 percent, compared with 8.68 percent in 2024 and 25.4 percent in 2023.\n\nTotal equity inflows for the year stood at Rs 3.51 lakh crore, down 11.19 percent from Rs 3.94 lakh crore in 2024 and Rs 1.62 lakh crore in 2023.\n\nAnalysts said the absence of outflows despite nearly 16 months of muted returns indicates continued investor commitment. They said many investors remain focused on a three- to four-year horizon, even as near-term returns have been weak, while investment in assets such as gold and silver at current elevated prices is harder to justify for long-term allocations.\n\nIndependent research analyst Ambreesh Baliga said inflows into mutual funds are likely to continue going ahead as mid-cap and small-cap funds have delivered better results than individual portfolios. While many individual portfolios are down 20 percent to 30 percent or more, he said even the worst-performing mid-cap and small-cap funds were down only about 5 percent to 6 percent as of the end of December.\n\nBaliga said investor interest remains as long as losses are limited. He added that when losses become large, investors stop averaging, liquidity in the secondary market declines, selling pressure rises, and stocks can fall further, sometimes leading to margin calls."

        "full_content": "The Indianmutual fundindustry’s assets under management (AUM) eased slightly to about Rs 80.2 lakh crore in December 2025, down from Rs 80.8 lakh crore in November, reflecting the impact of volatile markets and foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows. Market benchmarks mirrored this cautious sentiment, with the Sensex and Nifty slipping 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively, while broader indices also fell—the BSE MidCap declined 0.5% and the BSE SmallCap dropped 1.01%.\n\nDespite this overall dip, equity mutual funds, flexi-cap funds, and gold ETFs continued to attract strong investor interest, highlighting sustained confidence in long-term market opportunities. Equity mutual funds recorded net inflows of Rs 28,054 crore for the month, marking the 58th consecutive month of positive equity flows.\n\nHere are some of the key highlights\n\nRetail participation remained strong, with 26.4 lakh new folios added during December, taking the total number of folios in the industry to 26.12 crore. In December, 23 open-ended schemes mobilised a combined Rs 4,074 crore. Equity-oriented funds led both in launches and collections, raising Rs 3,568 crore, including the highest collection of Rs 2,468 crore by Abakkus Flexi Cap Fund. Hybrid schemes attracted Rs 302 crore, while the sole debt fund, Abakkus Liquid Fund, raised Rs 34 crore. Other schemes, including 15 index funds and ETFs, garnered Rs 170 crore.\n\nRetail MF folios across Equity, Hybrid, and Solution Oriented schemes increased to 20,27,86,198 in December 2025, compared with 20,15,85,661 in November 2025, indicating steady growth in retail participation. Correspondingly, Retail AUM for these segments stood at Rs 47.36 lakh crore as of December 2025, highlighting sustained investor confidence and continued asset accumulation in the retail mutual fund space.\n\nFlexi-cap funds lead equity inflows\n\nFlexi-cap funds emerged as the standout category, recording a 23.2% month-on-month rise in inflows to Rs 10,019 crore, making them the largest contributor to equity flows for December. Himanshu Srivastava, Principal Research at Morningstar Investment Research India, said, “The moderation in flows could be attributed to cooling momentum in mid-cap and small-cap segments, where inflows tapered after a strong run-up in valuations and periodic market corrections. Investors are adopting a more selective and disciplined approach, balancing return expectations with valuation comfort. Market volatility has also prompted profit-booking during opportunistic moments.”\n\nSrivastava added, “The launch of the new Abakkus Flexi Cap Fund, which garnered net assets worth Rs 2,468 crore, boosted the overall inflow. The category continues to be the biggest beneficiary.”\n\nVaiibhavv Chugh, CEO of Abakkus Mutual Fund, noted, “Flexi-cap funds continue to be preferred as they allow inbuilt flexibility to maneuver across market caps. Large- and mid-cap funds are also relevant, given valuations in large caps are reaching comfortable levels. The industry-wide emphasis on asset allocation as a strategy to navigate volatility is clearly reflected in the growth of multi-asset allocation funds.”\n\nOther equity categories see mixed trends\n\nInflows in mid-cap and small-cap funds declined month-on-month by 6.9% and 13.2%, respectively, but remained robust at Rs 4,176 crore and Rs 3,824 crore. Large-cap funds and large-and-mid-cap funds saw declines of 4.4% and 9.1%, with inflows of Rs 1,567 crore and Rs 4,094 crore. ELSS funds recorded net outflows of Rs 718 crore, while dividend yield funds saw net outflows of Rs 254 crore.\n\nSuranjana Borthakur, Head of Distribution & Strategic Alliances at Mirae Asset Investment Managers (India), said, “With mid- and small-cap valuations appearing relatively expensive and market performance uneven, flexi-cap funds have emerged as a preferred option. These funds allow investors to adjust exposure across large, mid, and small-cap stocks, reducing the need for frequent allocation changes.”\n\nSectoral and thematic funds experienced the steepest decline, falling 49.3% month-on-month, though they still attracted Rs 946 crore. Borthakur explained, “The AMFI data shows a shift in investor preference toward broader, diversified categories. In 2024, elevated inflows into sectoral and thematic funds were driven largely by return chasing. Many investors have since recalibrated their approach, favoring balanced categories such as flexi-cap funds, which accounted for 23% of YTD net inflows in equity.”\n\nDebt mutual funds faced heavy redemptions, with net outflows exceeding Rs 1.2 lakh crore, led by liquid, money market, and short-duration funds. This was largely due to advance tax payments and quarter-end treasury withdrawals, a recurring pattern each fiscal quarter.\n\nHybrid funds, however, recorded net inflows of approximately Rs 10,756 crore, supported by strong interest in multi-asset allocation funds, which attracted Rs 7,426 crore—the highest in six months. Borthakur noted, “Within hybrid categories, a significant portion of inflows is directed toward arbitrage funds for short-term surplus deployment. Multi-asset funds have seen 30% of YTD inflows in hybrid, reflecting growing demand for diversified portfolios encompassing equity, debt, and commodities.”\n\nGold and passive funds continue to draw interest\n\nThe passive fund segment maintained momentum, with AUM reaching a record Rs 14.57 lakh crore. ETFs and index funds together saw Rs 26,723 crore in net inflows, driven largely by gold and silver ETFs.\n\nBorthakur said, “Gold has had an exceptional year, with net inflows into gold ETFs rising fourfold compared to last year. Gold is increasingly viewed not only as a hedge but as a strategic, long-term portfolio component.” In December, gold ETF inflows hit an all-time high of Rs 11,000 crore. Silver ETFs also drew strong interest, with inflows of Rs 3,962 crore, taking overall AUM to Rs 72,652 crore.\n\nSrivastava noted, “Strong gold price momentum through 2025, coupled with heightened safe-haven demand, has supported sustained investor interest. Indian investors increasingly view gold ETFs as a regulated, liquid, and cost-efficient alternative to physical gold, particularly during equity and bond market volatility. Steady allocations to gold ETFs, even amid market swings, underline their role as a strategic hedge and diversification tool.”\n\nSIP inflows reach record levels\n\nSystematic Investment Plan (SIP) inflows reached an all-time high of Rs 31,002 crore in December. SIP assets stood at Rs 16.63 lakh crore, accounting for 20.7% of total AUM, while contributing accounts rose to 9.79 crore, up from 9.43 crore in November.\n\nDuring December, 60.46 lakh new SIPs were registered, up from 57.13 lakh in November, while 51.57 lakh SIPs were discontinued or matured, compared with around 43 lakh in the previous month. This pushed the SIP stoppage ratio to 85%, up from 75.56% in November.\n\nStrategic Investment Funds (SIFs) also gained traction, with AUM rising to Rs 4,892 crore from Rs 2,932 crore. The category saw inflows of Rs 1,933 crore, with hybrid strategies attracting Rs 1,571 crore, reflecting investor interest in structured, diversified investment approaches."

        "full_content": "India has taken ambitious strides toward establishing a robust domestic carbon market through its Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), while simultaneously promoting a market-based environmental restoration through the Green Credit Programme (GCP). However, a critical oversight in these parallel initiatives threatens to undermine the integrity of both systems: the explicit permission for forestry projects to register under both schemes simultaneously.\n\nThis allowance, buried in the methodologies of both mechanisms, creates what carbon accounting experts call \"double-counting. When a single tree can generate both a Carbon Credit Certificate (CCC) for its carbon sequestration value and a Green Credit (GCs) for its physical existence, we're essentially allowing the same environmental benefit to be claimed twice. This isn't just an accounting quirk but it's a fundamental threat to India's climate credibility.\n\nThe problem stems from the fact that these programmes measure environmental value differently. Under CCTS, forestry projects earn CCCs based on verified greenhouse gas removal, measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. A well-managed forest plantation might sequester 1,000 tonnes of CO₂ over its lifetime, generating 1,000 tradable carbon credits. Meanwhile, the same project earns Green Credits under GCP, one credit for each tree that survives beyond five years, provided the land parcel achieves a minimum canopy density of 40% over a 5-hectare area.\n\nOn paper, these seem complementary. In practice, they create perverse incentives. A corporate entity could use CCCs to claim carbon neutrality in its sustainability reporting while simultaneously using GCs from the same trees to fulfil compensatory afforestation obligations or Corporate Social Responsibility requirements. The same environmental action, i.e., planting and maintaining trees, gets counted multiple times across different compliance frameworks.\n\nThis matters because carbon markets only work when credits represent real, additional, and unique climate benefits. When Shell Oil claimed carbon neutrality partly through forest offsets that were also being counted by governments in their national climate pledges, the credibility of voluntary carbon markets took a severe hit. India risks repeating this mistake on its own soil.\n\nThe conflict deepens when examining how credits are calculated under each scheme. CCTS forestry methodologies adhere to conventional carbon accounting principles, including establishing baselines, proving additionality, and projecting sequestration over defined crediting periods. These can be either 10-year fixed terms or renewable 5-year cycles, with credits potentially issued based on projected carbon uptake.\n\nThe GCP takes an entirely different approach. It waits 5 years to verify tree survival and canopy density before issuing any credits. The focus is on ecological restoration outcomes, and only trees that survive the five-year threshold count toward credit generation. However, this methodology is heavily contested by ecologists.\n\nThese timing mismatches create obvious problems. A CCTS project might claim early-stage carbon sequestration credits while the same trees haven't yet qualified for GCs. Later, when those trees mature and canopy density increases, they also generate GCs. There's no mechanism to reconcile these different timelines or measurement approaches, leaving project developers to navigate conflicting standards without clear guidance.\n\nUnderstanding where these credits ultimately end up makes the concern about double-counting even more pressing. CCCs serve as both compliance and offset instruments in India's carbon market, purchased by obligated entities that fail to meet their emission intensity targets. These credits trade on CERC-approved power exchanges and can be banked for future compliance years or sold to other obligated entities.\n\nGCs, though non-tradable and non-transferable, can be exchanged once for compensatory afforestation requirements, CSR obligations, or project compliance. While they can't be sold on exchanges like CCCs, they still represent valuable compliance currency for businesses that need to offset their environmental impacts, especially by virtually purchasing forest carbon sequestration.\n\nThe Indian Carbon Market operates as a closed domestic system, with no linkages to international carbon markets yet. This isolation, while protecting against external manipulation, also means there's no international oversight to catch double-counting problems. The burden falls entirely on domestic regulators to ensure integrity.\n\nThe solution isn't to eliminate dual registration; the GCP and CCTS seemingly serve different policy objectives. However, the government must urgently address three critical gaps.\n\nFirst, establish explicit mechanisms to prevent double-counting. If a forestry project generates CCCs based on carbon sequestration, those trees' GCs should perhaps be discounted proportionally, or vice versa. Alternatively, clear guidelines should mandate separate accounting for claims made under each scheme, preventing companies from using both credits toward overlapping compliance obligations.\n\nSecond, harmonise methodologies where possible. While the programmes measure different things, their verification standards, baseline establishment procedures, and monitoring requirements should align to reduce developer confusion and improve transparency.\n\nThird, strengthen reporting requirements. Any entity claiming environmental benefits from projects registered under both schemes must disclose this dual registration and clearly delineate which benefits are attributed to which credits. This transparency enables stakeholders to evaluate whether environmental claims are legitimate or exaggerated.\n\nIndia's climate ambitions are substantial, reaching net-zero emissions by 2070 requires mobilising massive private investment into carbon reduction and removal projects. Domestic carbon markets and green credit systems are essential tools for channelling that capital efficiently. But these markets only function if participants trust that credits represent genuine, non-duplicated environmental benefits.\n\nThe double-counting loophole, if left unaddressed, risks eroding this trust before India's carbon market even matures. International investors, corporate buyers, and civil society watchdogs are increasingly sophisticated in detecting carbon accounting irregularities. India cannot afford to have its domestic climate instruments dismissed as greenwashing vehicles.\n\n(Shashank Pandey is a lawyer.)\n\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stance of this publication."

        "full_content": "The next phase of India’s climate story will be written not in carbon targets, but in resilient infrastructure and supply chains built to withstand extremes. Studies cited by the Reserve Bank of India estimate that rising heat stress and reduced labour productivity could shave off up to 4.5% of India’s GDP by 2030. Recent heatwaves and localised floods have already disrupted manufacturing clusters and strained urban systems, offering a preview of what lies ahead. Yet adaptation—strengthening systems to withstand these shocks—still receives only a fraction of global climate finance.\n\nIndia today faces a stark paradox. While global negotiations remain focused on emission reductions, the country’s near-term growth already depends on how well it adapts to a hotter, more volatile climate. The UN Environment Programme’s latest Adaptation Gap Report places adaptation costs for developing countries at about US$215 billion per year this decade, rising to nearly US$387 billion annually when countries’ stated priorities are fully included. India’s own Initial Adaptation Communication to the UN climate convention estimates a cumulative adaptation finance requirement of approximately US$673 billion by 2030 to climate-proof agriculture, water systems, infrastructure, and urban development. Despite these needs, most finance continues to flow toward mitigation, leaving a widening gap between climate risks and investment.\n\nFor business, this imbalance is both a risk and an opportunity. The emerging “adaptation economy” spans infrastructure retrofits, climate-smart agriculture, water security, resilient supply chains, and new forms of climate-linked finance. As Asia becomes the epicentre of climate exposure, India is positioned to lead and capture a meaningful share of what could be a US$600 billion to US$1 trillion global market for climate-resilience solutions by 2030, according to emerging assessments of resilience technologies and services. The message is clear: adaptation is no longer peripheral to growth; it is central to maintaining economic momentum in a decade defined by climate disruption.\n\nThis opportunity is hiding in plain sight. Global adaptation finance for developing countries falls short by an estimated US$200–400 billion annually. This mismatch between risk and investment is why adaptation has become a business issue, not merely a government concern. Large empirical studies by the World Resources Institute, examining hundreds of adaptation projects across countries, show average economic internal rates of return of nearly 27%, with every dollar invested generating more than ten dollars in benefits over a decade. Resilience, in other words, is an investment class waiting to be mainstreamed.\n\nTechnological Innovation and Financial Tools\n\nAdaptation is fundamentally the business of continuity. It keeps supply chains functional during extreme weather, allows cities and factories to operate despite floods and heatwaves, and protects workers and consumers in a hotter climate. In infrastructure, this means flood-resistant roads, heat-resilient buildings, and stormwater systems designed for new rainfall patterns. In agriculture, it includes drought-tolerant seeds, climate-indexed insurance, and digital advisory tools that help farmers and food companies manage volatility. In water management, it ranges from desalination and aquifer recharge to mangrove restoration and integrated river-basin planning.\n\nTechnology and finance are enabling a quiet shift in how resilience is built. Indian startups are developing AI-based early-warning systems, satellite-driven crop analytics, and IoT sensors that provide real-time climate data to insurers, utilities, logistics operators, and municipal planners. On the financial side, parametric insurance— which automatically triggers payouts when defined climate thresholds are breached—is gaining traction. Development institutions and governments are also experimenting with resilience bonds and blended-finance instruments to crowd in private capital for climate-proof infrastructure. The Reserve Bank of India’s increasing emphasis on climate-risk disclosure signals that resilience will soon influence lending decisions, asset valuations, and corporate creditworthiness.\n\nIndia’s Policy Evolution and Global Shifts\n\nAsia is warming at roughly twice the global average, according to the World Meteorological Organization, making it the world’s ground zero for climate risk. For India, the stakes are especially high. More than half the population remains dependent on climate-sensitive sectors, and even short periods of extreme heat or erratic rainfall can ripple across food prices, health systems, and industrial output. S&P Global estimates that nearly 60% of India’s listed companies face material physical climate risk by mid-century, underscoring how deeply adaptation will shape future competitiveness.\n\nIndia’s policy environment is evolving in response. Work is underway on the country’s first National Adaptation Plan, led by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The government has described the plan as a forthcoming national blueprint to embed climate resilience across agriculture, water, infrastructure, health, and coastal protection. This builds on existing pillars such as state climate action plans, heat-action planning, resilient infrastructure missions, and long-term low-emissions strategies that increasingly incorporate adaptation.\n\nThe outcomes of COP30 in Belém further reinforce this direction. The summit marked a decisive global shift toward adaptation, with countries agreeing to triple adaptation finance by 2035 and accelerate implementation under the Global Goal on Adaptation. These decisions reflect India’s long-standing emphasis on equitable, grant-based finance and recognition of the development needs of emerging economies. For Indian businesses, the signal is unmistakable: future climate finance flows, risk metrics, and investment frameworks will increasingly prioritise resilience and physical risk management. Companies that build early capabilities—whether by assessing asset-level climate risks, upgrading infrastructure, adopting new technologies, or partnering with governments—will be better positioned to attract capital and withstand volatility.\n\nConclusion: Adaptation as Strategic Necessity\n\nAdaptation may not command the glamour of net-zero targets, but it determines whether economies like India’s can sustain growth in a world defined by disruption. For corporates, this is no longer about altruism; it is a strategic necessity. Those that invest in resilient operations, products, and supply chains will be the ones to withstand future shocks and shape new market opportunities. The adaptation economy is no longer hidden; it is the foundation of future value creation. For India, leading on adaptation offers not just protection from climate risks, but the opportunity to innovate and build the solutions that a warming world urgently needs.\n\n(Suryaprabha Sadasivan, Senior Vice President, Chase Advisors.)\n\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stance of this publication."
